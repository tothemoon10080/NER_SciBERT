This work is devoted to a kinetic and mass transfer study of simultaneous cementation of nickel and cobalt on zinc powder through stirred tank reactor. The influence of different parameters (stirring rate, temperature, zinc dust quantity, concentration of zinc and copper) on the process of cementation of cobalt and nickel in similar conditions to those of industrial zinc sulphate solution was experimentally determined. These parameters were studied for their effect on the rate of simultaneous cementation represented by the product

Mechanistic study of the reaction through activation energy determination (13kJmol−1) showed that the cementation of nickel on zinc is a diffusion controlled reaction.

                           The temporal evolution of the cobalt concentration has revealed that the re-dissolution of cobalt occurred after about 50min. The reaction of cobalt was found under chemical control.The cementation reaction of nickel was found to proceed with two different rates: an initial fast rate followed by a final slower one. The product The temporal evolution of the cobalt concentration has revealed that the re-dissolution of cobalt occurred after about 50 specific geometrical surface area (relate to solution density) (cm specific effective surface area (relate to solution density) (cm cobalt and nickel concentration at time initial concentration of nickel and cobalt (mg average zinc particles diameter (cm) nickel-ion diffusivity (cm diameter of cylindrical glass reactor overall mass transfer coefficient (cm overall apparent mass transfer coefficient (cm Reynolds number Sherwood number Schmidt number ( time (min) temperature (°K) volume of solution (cm angular velocity of the agitator (rad power dissipate solution cinematic viscosity (cm During the electrowinning stage of hydrometallurgical zinc production, the basic problem related to the quality of the deposited metal and the energy costs of the process is the deleterious effect of small amounts of more noble metals, for example: Ni, Co, Cu, etc. These metal impurities, which are more precious than zinc, can influence the purity of the cathode sediment through co-sedimentation and facilitate the reverse dissolution of zinc The experimental set-up used in the experiments is shown in At intervals of times, a sample of 2 Concentration at time It is seen that in the course of time ( Whatever the acting parameter is, the fast initial period of nickel cementation observed after the transition period shows that the product of the mass transfer coefficient by the effective surface area follows Eq. The analysis of For the bath reactor used in the present work, the product In the present work, the effect of the processing parameters was first presented upon the kinetic of the cementation dealing with the variation of the product Then the mass transfer in the reactor is analysed by introducing an apparent mass coefficient transfer  It has been established that the presence of copper in the solution, which is used as cementation aids, is necessary for the antimony dissolution and cobalt cementation  We can conclude from the results obtained in In order to evaluate the hydrodynamic effect over the global mass transfer in the stirring bath reactor, empirical correlation was envisaged using the dimensionless groups, The results obtained in our stirred tank reactor system denote a highly turbulent flow as explained above regarding exponent of Reynolds number. In order to compare our experimental results with those of literature, it is recommended to correlate them under analogous form The cementation reaction of nickel was found to proceed with two different rates: an initial fast rate followed by a final slower one. The product The cobalt cementation results show the reverse dissolution of metallic cobalt cemented after 50 The zinc sulphate concentration has no measurable effect on the kinetic cementation rate of nickel; however, it influences negatively the cementation of cobalt. The lowest values of cobalt content have been obtained at a temperature of 85
