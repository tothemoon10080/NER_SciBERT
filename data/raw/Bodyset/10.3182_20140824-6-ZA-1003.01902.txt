A novel suboptimal control technique for output tracking was developed using model predictive static programming (MPSP). The control technique was applied to a nonlinear model of a single-stage closed grinding mill circuit in simulation. The control technique could determine a suboptimal input trajectory to maintain the output variables at their desired values within 7 iterations. The input trajectory determined after only 2 iterations was already close to the final solution. This technique shows promise to significantly reduce computational time to find a suboptimal input trajectory for output tracking in large industrial processes.
