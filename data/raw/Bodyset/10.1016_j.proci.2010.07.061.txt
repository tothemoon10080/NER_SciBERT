Mineral matter in coal is one of the most important sources of problems in coal combustion, including fouling, slagging and corrosion, etc. Mineral matter transformation and slag formation are specific properties of coal that provide more information on the suitability for coal combustion or gasification. In this research, the sintering behavior of Chinese pulverized coal (PC) ash as well as mineral transition mechanism under various atmospheres, especially iron-bearing minerals, was studied by heating microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) combined with EDX (SEM-EDX). Furthermore, the molecular chemical characteristics of iron-bearing minerals, fayalite (2FeO·SiO2), were also calculated using quantum chemistry theory to provide an insight into the mineral reaction mechanism at molecular level in detail. The results showed that the different states of iron (Fe2+ or Fe3+) are the dominant reasons for different sintering behaviors of coal ash under different conditions. The iron-bearing minerals in ash, such as wustite (FeO), almandite (3FeO·Al2O3·3SiO2) and fayalite, etc., are the most important factors influencing the initial sintering behavior of coal ash in the temperature range from 1273 to 1373K under reducing condition during coal combustion. In fayalite molecular cluster, it is because that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are mostly constituted by Fe atoms and the minimum energy difference between HOMO and LUMO in fayalite cluster (1.659eV) is much lower than that of mullite (3Al2O3·2SiO2, 6.8eV) and kaolinite (Al2O3·2SiO2·2H2O, 3.49eV), the thermal stability of fayalite is relatively low and Fe atoms (especially Fe(6), Fe(8) and Fe(3)) have relatively higher reactivity than any other atoms in fayalite molecular cluster. That is the reason why fayalite starts to melt at relatively low temperature during ash sintering behavior.China is the world’s largest producer and user of coal, and the demand of coal has been rapidly growing in the past 10 Two typical Chinese bituminous coals A and B with different iron oxide contents in ash were selected to use in this work. These coals were firstly grounded to less than 75 Furthermore, in order to investigate the mineral transition mechanism in ash under reducing condition, the crystalline phases present in coal and sintered ash samples (under reducing condition) at various temperatures (1073, 1173, 1258, 1373, 1473 and 1573 In order to deeply understand the mineral transition mechanism in ash at molecular level, the mineral molecular surface chemical properties of fayalite were firstly studied using quantum chemistry calculation with The sintering behavior of ashes A and B under three different conditions is shown in The main mineral transition in ashes A and B under reducing condition from 1073 to 1573 Since fayalite is one of the most important Fe-bearing minerals that influence the initial sintering behavior of coal ash during ash sintering process based on experimental result, the reaction activity and thermal stability of fayalite were firstly studied and analyzed using quantum chemical calculation for the current research. Further calculation on the other main Fe- and Ca-bearing minerals will be done to explore and explain the complex mineral reaction mechanism of ash during ash sintering process. The molecular structure cell of fayalite belongs to orthorhombic system with cell dimensions: Furthermore, in order to explain the different thermal stability of minerals in ash, Δ The sintering behavior and mineral transition mechanism of PC ash, especially iron-bearing minerals, under various conditions were studied by heating microscopy, XRD, SEM-EDX and further combination with quantum chemical calculation of fayalite. The following conclusions were reached: The Based on XRD and SEM-EDX data of ashes A and B during ash sintering under reducing condition, it is shown that wustite, almandite and fayalite act as the key factors influencing the initial sintering behavior of ash in the temperature range from 1273 to 1373 In fayalite molecular cluster, it is because that the HOMO and LUMO are mostly constituted by Fe atoms, especially Fe(3), Fe(6) and Fe(8), and the minimum value of Δ This work was funded by
