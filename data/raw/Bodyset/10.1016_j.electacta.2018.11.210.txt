Using density functional theory (DFT), a series of Mn(4,4′-R-bpy)(CO)3Br (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine, R = CN, CF3, COOH, H, CH3,

                     Bu, and OCH3) complexes has been studied for electrocatalytic CO2 to CO reduction. Here, we show that the formation of active catalytic species ([Mn(4,4′-R-bpy)(CO)3]-) proceeds via two different reduction pathways for electron-donating (OCH3, H, CH3, and 
                        t
                     Bu) and electron-withdrawing (CN, CF3, and COOH) bpy-substituents, respectively. Interestingly, electron-withdrawing bpy-substituents require lower reduction potentials compared to the electron-donating bpy-groups and the calculated reduction potentials agree well with the experimentally reported values. Our detailed study shows that electron-withdrawing bpy-substituents based Mn-complexes can be energetically favourable for two-electron reduction, but they are thermodynamically unfavourable for overall electrocatalytic CO2 to CO reduction. The reason being that such electron withdrawing substituents increase the electron density on the bpy ligand while decrease it on the Mn centre, which in turn make the CO2 binding to the Mn-complexes unfavourable compared to that in the presence of electron-donating substituents. Therefore, it can be concluded that electron-withdrawing substituents restrict the bpy ligand to act as an ideal redox ligand. On the other hand, though the electron-donating bpy-substituents based Mn-complexes require higher potential for reduction, but they can be promising for CO2 reduction and provide aplenty of scope for further improvements.The catalytic electrochemical conversion of CO Such redox-based ligands have been utilized in a wide range of catalytic reactions, especially playing a crucial role in electrochemical reactions, and the electrochemical CO As an alternative to Re-based catalysts, Mn-bpy based catalysts have been found to be promising due to their abundance and higher similar catalytic activity [ All the computational calculations have been carried out using the density functional theory (DFT) based methods as implemented in Gaussian 09 D.01 package [ We have investigated a series of Mn(bpy-R)(CO) The Mn-complex can undergo two separate one-electron reduction processes for the formation of an active catalyst for CO  However, To understand the different reduction pathways for electron-donating ( As previous experimental and theoretical studies have reported that the single-electron reduced species ( After two one-electron reduction reactions, the resulting catalytic species  On the other hand, both the processes are favourable in the presence of electron-donating substituents over electron-withdrawing substituents. We have calculated pK Furthermore, our calculated reaction free energies and barriers suggest that the electron-donating substituents favour CO Furthermore, we have investigated the NBO charges on Mn centre and summed the charges on bpy ligand to understand the reason behind the high free energy barrier for electron-withdrawing substitutions for CO After the binding of CO Once the C Further to this, the one-electron reduction may take place on Further to this, one-electron reduction of We have investigated a series of Mn-bpy catalysts for electrocatalytic CO We thank IIT Indore for the lab and computing facilities.
