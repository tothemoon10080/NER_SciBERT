Genuine Savings (GS) have been much used in recent years as an indicator of a country's sustainability. According to some theorists (e.g. Arrow et al., 2012), under certain conditions a country with a positive level of GS should experience non-declining future utility, given the assumption of unlimited substitutability among all forms of capital (sometimes called “weak” sustainability). This paper reports the first very long-run tests of GS (also called comprehensive investment or adjusted net savings) as a forward-looking indicator of future well-being. We assemble data for British capital back to 1765, and construct several net investment measures which are used as indicators of two alternative measures of future well-being: consumption per capita and real wages. An allowance for a “value of time” due to exogenous technological progress is included in some GS measures, and we demonstrate the importance of this measure and the choice of discount rate over the very long-run. On the whole, our results do not reject the postulated relationship between GS and future well-being, and show GS can be a forward looking indicator of future well-being for periods of up to 100 years.The idea of using a nation's Genuine Savings (also referred to as Comprehensive Investment, Inclusive Investment and Adjusted Net Savings) as a forward-looking indicator of “weak” sustainability is now well-known ( In this paper, we investigate the relationship between increasingly comprehensive measures of GS and two well-being indicators for Great Britain over the period 1765–2000. We test a set of hypotheses which relate GS to changes in future well-being, using the framework suggested by Sustainable development has been defined by The relationship between a country's asset base, annual changes in this asset base and future well-being is also a feature of neo-classical growth theory. In this paper, we make use of the theoretical and empirical testing framework set out in If population grows at a varying rate, then the relationship between per capita GS and the present value of changes in future consumption is altered. FHV expressed this new relationship in discrete time as follows:  H H H Their results showed that H   There is thus rather limited evidence on the link between GS and future well-being. In this paper we aim to extend FHV in a number of important ways. First, we assemble and then use a data set which extends over a much longer time period, at around 250 years. We test whether the implications of theory concerning the relationship between GS and future well-being are borne out in this long run data. Given that sustainable development is a long-term policy concern, and that the theoretical models behind the GS indicator are cast in infinite time, this seems an important and novel advantage. Second, we investigate the effects of allowing for a “value of time passing”; treating time as an uncontrolled capital stock that through exogenous technological progress expands the economy's production possibilities ( Based on (3) and (4) above, the main hypotheses tests relate to the theoretical relationship between GS and future well-being:   We conduct these tests over three different forward-looking periods, which are Our data relate to Great Britain, and descriptive statistics for the key variables are reported in Data appendix. As some historical and modern data pertains to the entirety of the United Kingdom at any given time, for some series this necessitates an adjustment for the exclusion of the whole of Ireland before 1921, and Northern Ireland thereafter. The economic and environmental history of Ireland is sufficiently distinct from that of Great Britain to warrant this procedure, and also ensures that we are dealing with a consistent geographical unit over time. Of course, the quality of the data both for the distant past and more recent years is crucial to the reliability of our tests. The historical data constructions draw upon a long tradition of scholarship in quantitative economic history, for a survey see In this study we have largely used data series widely accepted by economic historians. We have indicated below where data are less certain and discuss how the data quality might affect the results. Historians' reconstructions have been linked to Office of National Statistics (ONS) estimates, utilising consistent definitions. To conduct the hypotheses tests NETPINV: annual changes in net produced capital and net overseas assets GREENINV: NETPINV plus changes in elements of the stock of natural capital GS: GREENINV plus changes in human capital GREENTFP and GSTFP: GREENINV and GS plus the value of changes in exogenous technological progress GSWPOP and GSTFPWPOP: GS and GSTFP less wealth dilution per capita Produced investment comprises net domestic fixed capital formation, changes in inventories and net foreign investment. These data are from The average value of net produced investment relative to GDP was nearly twice as high 1860–1914, compared the preceding century 1760–1860. This was largely due to higher net overseas investment. Produced investment fell dramatically during the world wars, and the investment ratio was low between 1914 and 1945. The recovery of produced investment after 1945 was largely due to a rise in domestic fixed capital formation. Our measure of green investment includes changes in the forestry stock and the extraction of coal, oil, natural gas, iron ore, lead, copper, tin, and zinc. As direct data on the area or stocking rate of all British woodland was not collected until well into the twentieth century, our estimates must proceed from fragmentary information and research by landscape and environmental historians. The area of British woodland rose from around 1 million hectares in 1765 to around 3 million in 2000, augmenting the stock of natural capital. This shift is well-established and it is clear that nearly all of the change occurred during the twentieth century, and before 1900 the stocking rate of woodlands was both low and changed little, with a nadir of the standing volume around 1871. Despite substantial felling during the world wars, standing volume rose during the twentieth century, most markedly after 1945. Thus despite the paucity of direct data, our estimates can be considered reliable, and augmentation or diminishing of natural capital through change in the stock of timber was vanishingly small before 1900. Moreover, the increase in the rental value of woodlands has been low relative to produced investment or GDP. A variety of timber prices are used to estimate the price per cubic metre (see Data appendix) and combined with felling costs, essentially the cost of labour per cubic metre felled, to gauge changes in the value of standing volumes. The sharpest rise in the rental values of woodland occurred in the period after 1946 and averaged 0.18% of GDP, whereas the deepest decline occurred 1914–1918, when around one-third of the forest stock was felled, and the fall in rental value averaged −0.18% of GDP. The British economy extracted substantial quantities of non-renewable mineral resources over the last 250 years, and the issue has received a commensurate amount of attention from historians. Trends in extraction and costs of coal are well-known. Coal mining dominated mineral extraction until the 1970s, and oil and gas thereafter. Extracted coal rents are measured by the difference between pithead coal prices and labour costs per ton, multiplied by coal production, using the sources described in Data appendix. In the case of oil and gas marginal extraction costs are near zero, and the value of production is used to measure the value of extracted rents. While production estimates for iron ore, copper, tin, zinc and lead are extant, detailed information on extraction costs is missing. These industries declined in importance during the nineteenth century, and the 1907 Industrial Census only distinguishes employment in coal and iron mining. However, this does mean that labour productivity in coal and iron mining, and average extraction costs per ton, can be gauged at this date. Methods of extraction in the smaller metal mining industries was similar to iron ore in the nineteenth century and changed little over this period, and thus labour costs per ton are taken here to be the same for all mining of metals. In the two centuries prior to 1960, the value of extracted mineral rents averaged around 2% of GDP, chiefly from coal mining. Thereafter coal rents became less important, but the extraction of North Sea oil pushed overall mineral rents to a peak of around 7% of GDP in the 1980s, then falling to around 2.5% of GDP in the 1990s. The extracted rental value of other minerals was low relative to GDP. That of iron ore peaked around 1870 at 0.65% of GDP and fell to around 0.05% by 1900. Collectively extracted rents from lead, zinc, tin and copper ores reached around 0.2% of GDP by 1850 but dwindled to around 0.02% by the 1920s. As with the World Bank methodology, we have incorporated public expenditure on schooling into our GS calculations as a proxy for investments in human capital. Data on public expenditure on education were derived from Carpentier (  An annual TFP index was constructed as follows: Trend growth TFP estimates can be used to underpin the valuation of exogenous technological progress. Treating technological progress as an uncontrolled stock of capital associated with the ‘passing of time’ which can be measured by TFP assumes that all technological progress is exogenous ( The measure of aggregate wealth follows the The increasingly comprehensive measures NETPINV, GREENINV, GS, GREENTFP, GSTFP, GSWPOP and GSTFPWPOP are illustrated in The GS/GDP ratio fell during and between the World Wars, reflecting falls in domestic and overseas investment. The post-war recovery of the ratio to its 1960s peak of around 14% was driven by domestic fixed capital formation and higher investment in education. Subsequently, the ratio halved in the final quarter of the twentieth century as the extraction of oil rents surged and there was a relative fall in domestic capital formation. Continuingly high levels of education investment, which averaged around 5% of GDP in the period 1970–2000, ameliorated the decline in GS/GDP. The effects of augmenting GS with the value of technology are also most substantial in the second half of the twentieth century. Technology-augmented GS shows positive values throughout the period 1760–2000 and averages 29% of GDP from 1960 to 2000, using a 2.5% per annum discount rate, or 26% of GDP from 1960 to 2000 using a 3.5% per annum discount rate. GS, adjusted for the wealth dilution ( Following FHV ( We now provide a discussion of the estimation methods and the results of the tests outlined in Testing genuine savings in the (very) long-run as applied to the various measures of GS and well-being outlined in Data. Our empirical models adopt two, alternative measures of future well-being; real consumption per capita and average real wages, which are linked to increasingly comprehensive measures of investment, including technology-augmented measures. Consumption estimates are extant for years from 1870, whereas estimates of real wages cover the period 1765–2009. The long spans of the univariate macroeconomic time series data used in the estimation and testing of the various models have the potential to exhibit non-stationary properties. Thus, without appropriate methods, estimates may be inefficient or spurious and the usual significance tests may be invalid. Cointegrating relationships, however, and their benefits and properties do not exist with all combinations of non-stationary series – there is a need to test for their existence. The two-step test used here appraises the time series properties of the residuals in a levels OLS regression, where the null hypothesis is of no-cointegration. The Engle–Granger method follows the OLS regression with a test of the error term's order of integration as step two. The residuals derived from the step-one process have the property of a generated regressor ( Using the estimation and testing framework outlined above, we first consider the relationship between future real wages, produced investment (NETPINV), green investment (GREENINV) and Genuine Savings (GS). The dependent variable is the present value of the future changes in real wages over 20, 50 and 100 years. Accordingly, for the shortest 20 year time horizon, and given that the real wage series runs to 2009, the sample period of investment must be 1765–1989, and for the 100 year time horizon it is 1765–1909. The rate chosen to discount future changes in real wages has important implications, especially over the 100 year time horizon. We prefer a discount rate of 2.5% per annum which equates to the average real interest on long British government bonds 1765–2000, but to test sensitivity we also report results using 3.5% per annum, the average rate used by FV for their post-1970 panel of countries. The results in The present value of changes in future consumption per capita provides an alternative measure of well-being which accords more closely with theory, but these data are only available from 1870. The estimates of In their landmark paper, Ferreira and Vincent did not find that GS had positive and significant effects on the future consumption of OECD countries, a result they attribute to their measure of GS excluding technical change. Longer time horizons reinforce the importance of including technology in measures of wealth. A series of theoretical papers have shown how omitting technological progress from the calculation of GS can be misleading ( The technology-augmented results provide strong support for the weakest and, in one case, for the strong hypotheses, most especially over the 100 year time horizon. The estimates of The results in Our core results utilise the longest samples feasible for each well-being horizon to investigate how well the theory (which is based on infinite horizons) holds up over the very long-run. A downside of using the longest feasible samples when assessing if With the investment samples confined to the period 1870–1909, the progressive extension of the horizon for future changes in consumption to 100 years yields estimates of In contrast to the finding of FHV, our results show adjusting the various investment measures for wealth dilution has a considerable effect on the estimated parameters, see The wealth-adjusted results reinforce the importance of augmenting GS with technological progress. In the TFP variants illustrated in The main contribution of this paper has been to undertake the first long-run test of the performance of Genuine Savings (GS) as an indicator of changes in future well-being. We constructed a British GS series back to 1765, and then tested how well GS indicates changes in future well-being over time periods of up to 100 years. For two alternative future well-being measures (real wages and consumption per capita) our results conform more closely with the theoretical relationship between GS and future well-being, and provide stronger support for the indicative capacity of the GS model, than has been found by previous authors. In particular they show the value of extending the well-being horizon to a period of 100 years and of incorporating a measure of technological progress in GS. The weaker sustainability hypothesis of a one to one relation ( However, a number of caveats need to be highlighted. Our longest sample results utilise real wages to measure future well-being, and these data show some discrepancies with estimates using of consumption per capita, although the latter should accord more closely with the underlying theory. Some elements of the pre-1870 data, including produced investment, are based upon decadal estimates. On balance our view is that the tests with the longest runs of data have utility, and their outcomes generally conform to the results based upon post-1870 data. An important issue for gauging future well-being over long horizons concerns the choice of discount rates. The results are sensitive to the discount rate, especially, unsurprisingly, over the longest 100 year time horizon. The preferred rate of 2.5% per annum used here reflects the real interest paid on British government long-term debt since 1765. Incorporating the value of exogenous technology in measures of GS has substantial effects on some variants of the results, although in the case of future change in consumption it is the short horizon results that are most affected. Over the 100 year time horizon the estimates of The exogenous measure of technological progress used here rests on estimates of TFP. In principle an endogenous measure of technology could be incorporated, as discussed by Strictly it is the value of technological progress to changes in the stock of wealth that needs to be gauged and added to GS ( At present, we follow the World Bank approach and measure changes in human capital via public investment in education. Yet for much of the time period under consideration, most workers spent little time in school, and thus public educational investments are unlikely to be good measures of their capacities ( There are also other enhancements that could be made to the ways in which GS are calculated. One is in the measurement of wealth. The top down approach used by necessity here probably overstates the capital dilution associated with a higher population. Nor is pollution presently included in our GS calculations. Whilst CO            We thank the See
