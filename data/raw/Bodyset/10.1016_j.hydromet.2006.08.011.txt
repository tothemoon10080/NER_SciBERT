The aim of this study is to determine the predominant chemical reaction during precipitation of ammonium uranyl carbonate (AUC) based on thermodynamic analysis and to investigate its kinetics. Four chemical reactions were considered. The Gibbs free energies, Δr
                     G°(T) derived from the Ulich calculations as a function of temperature have been determined between 293.15 K and 353.15 K. The predominant chemical reaction of AUC precipitation was UO2(NO3)2·6H2O(aq)
                     +6NH3(g)
                     +3CO2(g)
                     →(NH4)4UO2(CO3)3(s)
                     +2NH4NO3(aq)
                     +3H2O(l). According to the AUC precipitation kinetics results, the reaction best fits a second order rate equation. The rate constants k
                     2 were calculated at 313.15 K and 330.15 K and the activation energy E
                     a determined using the Arrehenius equation was found as 17.4 kJ/mol.The tetra-ammonium tricarbonate uranate compound [(NH The AUC precipitation process using gaseous CO CO the gas flow rate is easy to control, the AUC crystals produced are relatively large, the soluble impurities are easily filtered and are washable, The powder can be directly pressed into green pellets without preliminary granulation or milling operations. The AUC process has been commercialized by many industrial companies, e.g., in Germany, Sweden, Korea, and Argentina ( During the AUC precipitation from an uranyl nitrate solution, four reactions are possible ( The aim of this study was to determine the predominant chemical reaction during the precipitation of ammonium uranyl carbonate (AUC) based on the thermodynamic analysis and to investigate its kinetics. The Ulich calculations ( The equipment used in the present study to precipitate the AUC is represented in the process diagram shown in The AUC precipitation experiments were performed in a semi-batch mode according to the following three steps ( The methods of analysis used to determine the chemical composition of AUC powders and the resultant filtrate are listed below (  The Gibbs free energy derived from the Ulich calculations as a function of temperature of the four AUC precipitation reactions have been considered and their values were determined ( where Δ The constant values Δ Standard thermochemical data of the compounds used in the reactions The variation of the Gibbs free energies, Δ The Δ The evolution of U, NH Since the thermodynamic study of the precipitation of ammonium uranyl carbonate showed that the preponderant reaction at temperatures below 353.15 K, was UO where After integration, we obtain the following expressions:  The results, given in The activation energy has been determined by using the Arrhenius equation between The following major conclusions that can be drawn from the above study are: The predominant chemical reaction of AUC precipitation was UO The AUC precipitation cited above best fitted the second order rate reaction and their kinetic constants were 0.310 L/mol min at
