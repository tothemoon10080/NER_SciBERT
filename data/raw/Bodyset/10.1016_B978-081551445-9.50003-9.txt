This chapter explores and reviews the early history of the hydrothermal technology. A British Geologist was the first to use the hydrothermal in the mid 19th century. The first publication on hydrothermal research appeared in 1845. This reports successful synthesis of tiny quartz crystal upon transformation of freshly precipitated silicic acid in Papin's digestor by K.F.E Schafthaul. The greatest contribution in the 19th century was by H. De Senarmont, the founder of hydrothermal synthesis in geoscience. He used glass tubes containing gel, SiO2 and H2O, HCl, or CO2, enclosed in steel tubes, and heated at 200-300Â°C. The resultant product was a six-sided quartz prism with pyramidal termination. Toward the end of 19th century, Spezia from the Torino Academy of Science began his classical work on the seeded growth of quartz. Bowen took up a systematic study of the phase equilibria in high temperature silicate systems and, around the 1920's, he framed the most important petrologic principle, viz. Bowen's Reaction Principle. Perhaps the first systematic and pioneering study of the hydrothermal system began with the publication of the work on the ternary system H2O-K2SiO3-SiO2 by Moery and Fenner (1917). Besides the ternary system H2O-K2SiO3-SiO2 by Moery and Fenner the study of p-v-t relation of water became popular during the late 1920s. Today, the hydrothermal technique is being applied widely by various specialists from different branches of science including organic chemistry, biochemistry, biotechnology, food and nutrition, and environmental safety.
