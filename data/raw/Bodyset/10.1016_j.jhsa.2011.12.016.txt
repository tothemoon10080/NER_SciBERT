Maintaining ulnohumeral stability can be difficult when either the coronoid is too fragmented for primary repair or operative delay makes repair difficult or impossible. In addition to ligament repair, restoration of radiocapitellar contact using radial head arthroplasty, and hinged external fixation, reconstruction of the coronoid using a fragment of the discarded radial head—a technique described in this report—can help restore elbow stability and function.
