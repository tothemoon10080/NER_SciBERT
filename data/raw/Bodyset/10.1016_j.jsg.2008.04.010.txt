The Zuccale low-angle normal fault exposed on the island of Elba, Italy, is a crustal-scale structure which contains a strongly foliated fault core. In the immediate footwall of the Zuccale fault, cohesive fault-related breccias which were initially deformed by typical frictional deformation mechanisms experienced fluidization over areas of at least 10−2–10−3
                     km2.
                  Three internal variants of fluidized breccia are recognized, with each related to a separate fluidization event. Characteristics of the fluidized breccias include: (1) a highly irregular ‘intrusive’ boundary with the overlying fault core; (2) no grain-scale evidence for typical frictional deformation mechanisms; (3) an association with carbonate cements indicating that fluids contained CO2; and (4) a clast-preferred orientation suggesting that fluids were moving vertically and spreading laterally as they encountered the foliated fault core.
                  Our observations suggest that the fluidized breccias are representative of the interseismic period along the Zuccale low-angle fault, and developed across small fault patches during build-ups in fluid overpressure. Attainment of a critical fluid overpressure triggered embrittlement and the formation of low-angle slip surfaces and sub-vertical tensile veins within the overlying fault core, which may account for the presence and the dimensions (10−1–10−3
                     km2) of rupture surfaces which produce microseismicity along active low-angle normal faults in central Italy.Fluids exert a fundamental control on the mechanical and chemical behaviour of all types of fault and shear zone. There is a voluminous literature detailing field, laboratory and theoretical work carried out in an attempt to understand the role of fluids in earthquake rupture, the formation of hydrothermal ore deposits, and the long-term evolution of faulted regions of the crust and lithosphere at all depths and scales (e.g. reviews by Low-angle normal faults, which dip less than 30°, have received considerable attention since standard ‘Andersonian’ frictional fault theory does not predict such orientations and because large earthquakes on low-angle normal faults are rare or absent ( The aim of this paper is to describe in detail the geological setting, microstructural characteristics, and evolution of a suite of frictional fault rocks (breccias) which we believe to have experienced widespread fluidization beneath the Zuccale fault, a low-angle normal fault exposed on the Island of Elba. We focus our attention on a single coastal outcrop which contains 100% exposure in the immediate footwall of the Zuccale fault, and use our observations to develop a conceptual model for fluidization. We discuss our observations in the context of fluid cycling, the development of fluid overpressure associated with low-angle normal faults, and the recognition of fault rocks which represent particular phases of the seismic cycle. Elba lies ∼20 Central Italy is characterized by an anomalously high flux of non-volcanic CO Elba consists of a series of 5 stacked thrust sheets (Complexes I–V) which formed during late Cretaceous–early Miocene shortening ( The Zuccale fault is exposed particularly well at its type locality at Punta Di Zuccale ( From bottom to top, the sequence of fault rocks found along the Zuccale fault consists of five units: (1) breccias and cataclasites derived exclusively from the Palaeozoic footwall rocks and containing clasts of quartzite and quartz–mica schist surrounded by a carbonate–chlorite–quartz matrix. These were deformed by frictional deformation mechanisms including fracture, grain fragmentation and grain rolling. Although their distribution is heterogeneous, they typically have a minimum thickness of ∼3 Grey breccias occur in the immediate footwall of the Zuccale fault where they occupy a minimum area in plan view of ∼70 Grey breccia A is the most voluminous variant and occupies an area of ∼40 Variants B and C are texturally much more homogenous. Both are grey to milky-white in colour, and contain clasts of basement quartzite and quartz–mica schist not exceeding several tens of centimetres in diameter. Breccia C is differentiated from B on the basis of two specific mesoscopic characteristics. First, it occurs solely as discrete pods of material which sit at topographically and structurally higher levels than B ( The three variants of grey breccia appear to have formed at different times based on their structural relationship to extensional slip surfaces within the overlying foliated core of the Zuccale fault. Slip surfaces are commonly highly polished and associated with a thin (<1 Importantly, there is strong evidence that the coastal section containing the grey breccias is underlain by a major north–south trending high-angle extensional fault like those described in Section 2.2 and shown in All three variants of grey breccia appear to preserve ‘intrusive’ relationships with overlying foliated fault rocks within the core of the Zuccale fault ( Frictional breccias are typically characterized by a mosaic texture (following the terminology of Grey breccias appear remarkably different on a grain-scale, and their overall texture does not readily fit into one of the breccia classes proposed by  During frictional deformation, granular fault rocks such as breccias and cataclasites, which consist of packed and interlocking clasts, experience continuous fracturing due to high stresses at grain–grain contacts. Consequently, the probability that clasts will be fractured during frictional deformation is high. Once a granular fault rock becomes fluidized, the only mechanism capable of generating new clast fragments is head-on collision between clasts, or between clasts and the wall rocks. However, The analysis of fragmented counterparts involves scanning thin sections under the optical microscope and searching for fragmented counterparts with radius As noted above, We measured The In marked contrast, samples PZ001 and PZ003 show uniformly low Field observations suggest that a mesoscopic shape-preferred orientation (SPO) of quartzite and quartz–mica schist clasts is visible in places within grey breccia variants A and C ( The results of grain-scale SPO analyses are shown qualitatively as equal-area rose diagrams in The results indicate that there is a statistically significant SPO (at a 95% confidence level) of clasts present within the grey breccias. The SPO is strongest in the X1/X2 (horizontal) and X2/X3 (vertical, east–west) sections ( Several outcrop-scale observations suggest that the grey breccias have experienced fluidization. We define fluidization after Clasts of quartzite within the grey breccias are commonly overgrown by crystals of dolomite, and the red oxidized layer overlying the grey breccias is dominated by intergrowths of calcite and dolomite ( Grey breccias are developed in the footwall of the Zuccale fault in an area which contains: (a) pre-existing frictional breccias; (b) a north–south trending high-angle footwall fault (Section We interpret the clast-preferred orientations within the grey breccias as representative of a flow fabric generated by fluids moving through the breccias and causing transport and re-alignment of the constituent clasts. The SPO data are consistent with fluids moving upwards within the footwall from depth and spreading laterally in a north–south direction once they encountered the relatively impermeable fault core. This scenario would account for the sub-vertical SPO observed on vertical planes and the approximately north–south SPO observed on horizontal planes. All major hydrofracture veins which cross-cut the fault core link directly downwards into high-angle footwall faults, strongly suggesting that footwall structures act to focus and channel fluid flow (Section The ponding of fluids at the base of the Zuccale fault as a consequence of a waning in flow could result in the slow growth of fresh and undeformed carbonate within a thin alteration horizon overlying the grey breccias ( Once fluid overpressure in the footwall of the Zuccale fault reached a critical value (e.g. Fluidized fault rocks have been described on several occasions in the literature from a variety of tectonic settings. These include, but are not restricted to: decimetre-thick lenses of fluidized cataclasite found in association with pseudotachylytes within ancient accretionary complexes ( We believe that fluidization of the grey breccias found at Punta Di Zuccale is related to the interactions between slip along the low-angle Zuccale fault (which accommodates 6–8 During the interseismic stage along the Zuccale fault, the fault core likely possessed a low permeability and was deforming by mechanisms such as pressure-solution (‘frictional-viscous’) creep ( The fluidization of grey breccias at Punta Di Zuccale occurred over areas of 10  S.A.F.S. is funded by a University of Durham Doctoral Fellowship.
