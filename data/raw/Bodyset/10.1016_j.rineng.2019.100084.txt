Finite element analyses were performed using the standard finite element method to simulate conical piles of sand laying on a rigid-rough plate. An isotropic elasticity and a Mohr-Coulomb model were used to simulate the mechanical behavior of the sand. Effects of internal friction angle, interface friction angle, angle of repose of the pile on contact pressures and frictional shear stresses were determined. Distribution of computed stresses along the sand-plate interface did not exhibited any dip near the centerline.Conical stockpiles of sand have been modeled using several finite element methods (see e.g. Ref. [ Hummel and Finnan [ Michalowski1 and Park [ An implicit dynamic procedure using direct integration was used in quasi-static conditions to analyze the axisymmetric model shown in Here, Distribution of CPRESS and of frictional shear stress at surface nodes (CSHEAR1) versus true radial distance (R) were determined for all simulations described in All CPRESS-R curves show that the CPRESS strictly decreases when R increases from Within the framework of this study, no dip was found for the distribution of CPRESS. This result is consistent with findings reported in Ref. [ Analyses of CSHEAR1-R curves permit to draw several conclusions. CSHEAR1 first increases nonlinearly from R = 0 m (point O in The effect of the variation of
