The cubic Ti-containing MCM-48 (Ti-MCM-48) with the mesoporous structure was synthesized. The equilibrium and kinetic were chiefly studied. It was found that the maximum of Cd(II) on this adsorbent occurred in the pH 8 with an adsorption maximum of 83.57mg g-1. The Langmuir equation has a good correlation with the experimental data. Kinetic data of adsorption reactions and the adsorption equilibrium parameters were described by pseudo-second order equation which indicated well linear correlation. We also deep investigated adsorption mechanism of cadmium on Ti-MCM-48, which provide a theoretical basis for silicon mesoporous materials. It was concluded that Ti-MCM-48 had large surface area, thermal stability and high porosity showing application potentials in pre-treatment and environmental cleaning.
