Pilon fractures of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint are challenging injuries that can lead to arthritis, limited motion, and pain. Internal fixation is often difficult owing to comminution and inadequate bony support. External fixation requires a compliant patient and may result in pin-track infection, stiffness, and malunion. In this report, I describe a simple surgical technique of immediate bridge plating of the PIP joint with bone grafting followed by plate removal and joint release. This approach maintains the alignment, restores the articular congruity without the risk of pin-track infection, and allows immediate return to activities of daily living until fracture healing is completed.
