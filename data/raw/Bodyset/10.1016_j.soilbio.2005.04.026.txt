Prolonged elevated atmospheric CO2 might alter decomposition. In a 90-day incubation study, we determined the long-term (9 years) impact of elevated CO2 on N mineralization of Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens plant material grown at ambient and elevated CO2 and low- and high-15N fertilizer additions. No significant differences were observed in

The results suggest that elevated CO2 did not change plant N mineralization in any of the soils, because of a surplus of available N in the fertilized and leguminous systems, and because of insignificant plant responses to elevated CO2 in the low soil N availability systems.Land-use changes and large-scale combustion of fossil fuel have contributed to increased atmospheric CO The Swiss FACE experiment was established at Eschikon in 1993, Switzerland consists of six FACE rings, laid out in a split–split–plot design. Three of the rings are under ambient CO In March of 2002, 20 soil samples per plot were taken to a depth of 10 Soil N mineralization was measured at 0, 22, 50 and 90 days at 20 A Mixed Model ANOVA in the SAS system for Windows™ V8 was conducted with blocks (i.e. the field plots) as random effects and treatments (i.e. CO Mineralization of plant material N as revealed by recovery of At the Swiss FACE experiment elevated CO Thanks to the Swiss FACE field staff for assisting in the field and for providing a pleasant stay in Eschikon.
