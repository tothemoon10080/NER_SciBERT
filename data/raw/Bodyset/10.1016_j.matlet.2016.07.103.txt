TiO2/chrysotile-based silica nanofibers composites (TiO2/SiO2NFs) were synthesized for the first time via a modified sol-gel method combining layer self-assembly procedure. In the composite, TiO2 nanoparticles are anatase structured and evenly dispersed without agglomeration on the surface of SiO2NFs in the form of monolayer. Compared to the commercial TiO2 (P25) and TiO2 prepared by similar sol-gel method, the TiO2/SiO2NFs composite exhibits much higher photocatalytic activity. The SiO2NFs in the composite not only provide a large adsorption capacity substrate, but also make TiO2 particles formed a well-dispersed monolayer to provide larger photocatalytic reaction surface area, resulting in the significantly increasing of photocatalytic activity. It is also found the TiO2/SiO2NFs prepared under 800°C exhibits best photocatalytic activity due to the relatively optimum anatase crystalline phase fraction and crystallinity.Titania dioxide (TiO Previously, we reported a kind of amorphous silica nanofibers (SiO In present paper, we immobilize TiO Synthetic processes of TiO The phase composition of the as-prepared samples was identified by X-ray powder diffractionmeter (XRD, Empyrean, Panalytical). The morphology was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F). The element composition was determined by X-ray fluorescence (Axios max, Panalytical). The photocatalytic activity was evaluated by degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) solution.
