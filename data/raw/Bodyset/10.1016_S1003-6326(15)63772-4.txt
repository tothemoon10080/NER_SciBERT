The extraction of manganese from low-grade manganese oxide ores using CaS derived from CaSO4 as reductant was investigated. The effects of mass ratio of CaS to ore, reduction temperature, reduction time, liquid to solid ratio (L/S ratio), stirring speed, leaching temperature, leaching time and H2SO4 concentration on the leaching rates of Mn and Fe during the reduction–acid leaching process were discussed. The leaching rates of 96.47% for Mn and 19.24% for Fe were obtained under the optimized conditions of mass ratio of CaS to manganese oxide ore 1:6.7, L/S ratio 5:1, stirring speed 300 r/min, reduction temperature of 95 °C for 2.0 h in the reduction process and leaching stirring speed of 200 r/min, H2SO4 concentration of 1.5 mol/L, leaching temperature of 80 °C for 5 min in the leaching process. In addition, this process can be employed in the recovery of manganese from various manganese oxide ores, and Mn leaching rate above 95% is obtained.
