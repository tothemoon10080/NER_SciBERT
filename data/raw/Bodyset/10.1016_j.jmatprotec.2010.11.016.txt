This article has been retracted at the request of the authors and/or the Editor-in-Chief. Reason: This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor-in-Chief as it is a duplicate of a paper that has already been published in Canadian Metallurgical Quarterly, Vol. 42 (2003), pp. 333â€“342. One of the conditions of submission of a paper for publication is that authors declare explicitly that the paper is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. As such this article represents a severe abuse of the scientific publishing system. The scientific community takes a very strong view on this matter and apologies are offered to readers of the journal that this was not detected during the submission process.
