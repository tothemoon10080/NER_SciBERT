The beneficial effect of intercropping system under low phosphorus (P) conditions has already been reported in previous works. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that intercropping (common bean - maize) in P-deficient soil can enhance the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks from the microbial biomass (MB). The field experiment was conducted in Setif province in a northern Algerian agroecosystem with a Mediterranean climate. The nodule N storage in intercropped common bean was 60% higher than for sole crops and was highest in a P-deficient soil in the second year. The carbon stock from the microbial biomass of the soil (MBC) was higher with intercropping than for sole crops and fallow and was even higher in P-deficient (23%) soils as compared to P sufficient (17%) conditions. There was a strong correlation between C stock from nodule (NC) and MBC stock for intercropping in either P-deficient (r2 = 0.80***; p < 0.001) or P-sufficient soils (r2 = 0.69**; p < 0.01). P-deficient conditions gave the highest total soil respiration (1.68 g C-CO2 m−2 days−1) and the lowest MB C:N ratio (10.3 and 12.2 for common bean and maize, respectively) in intercrops system. This study showed that, in a P-deficient soil, intercropping is a good solution for increasing the rhizosphere MB through C and N partitioning between root nodules and rhizosphere microbial community, which is responsible for improving soil fertility and recycle mineral elements.A high soil quality improves agroecosystem services and sustains biological productivity which promotes plant growth and increases bioavailability of essential nutrients Most studies on legume-cereal intercropping system have shown the efficient use of environmental resources by stimulating plant growth and yield in calcareous and P-deficient soils Recent studies suggest that N storage in legume-cereal intercropping is greater as a result of a higher EURS in a P-deficient soil than in a P-sufficient soil Despite extensive literature on intercropping, little information is available on the effects of cereal-legume intercropping on microbial mediated processes and the relationship between intercropping and biological N Recent studies have reported an increase in microbial activity with higher SOM and MBC stock in intercropping systems than in corresponding sole cropping systems In order to ensure food security in Algeria with the current economic crisis and declining oil prices, the development and intensification of local farming practices has become a strategic necessity. However, most northern Algerian soils are alkaline (pH varying from 7.5 to 8.5) The effects of intercropping on agroecosystem productivity and on C and N storage have been well documented for both the short-term and the long-term A previous study reported that intercropping common bean and maize might be an alternative agronomical practice that is currently rarely used in north-east Algerian agroecosystems under low P conditions The study was performed in 2012 and 2013 at the same two experimental sites (P-deficient) S1 (35°58, 11′N and 5°14, 90′E) and (P-sufficient) S2 (35°53, 37′N and 5°37, 01′E) as in our previous study The study was carried out with one common bean cultivar ( Seventy days after sowing, corresponding to the full flowering stage, soil samples were taken from the rhizosphere of each species and the fallow plot. The rhizospheres of each of the maize and common bean roots were bulked for each replicate in all cropping systems. The rhizosphere samples were then stored at 4 °C for 72 h before analysis. The nodules were separated from the common bean roots, dried and weighed separately. For the soil samples during first growing season (2012), the total P concentration was determined using the malachite green method after digestion by nitric and perchloric acid For the soil and nodule samples taken at the flowering stage, the N concentration was determined using the Kjeldahl method and the total organic C concentrations in both soil and nodules were determined using the Walkley-Black method. The total microbial and root respiration (CO The MBC and MBN stock were measured by the laboratories at the National Institute of Agronomy Research (INRA, Montpellier, France). They were determined by a chloroform fumigation-extraction method derived from the Brookes and Jenkinson methods For comparison, all C and N concentrations (g plant MBC (or MBN) stock = C and N stock of the soil microbial biomass (in g m        NC and NN stocks is C and N stocks, respectively in common bean nodules (in g m   One-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) with the cropping system as a factor ( In both years, NC and NN stocks of common bean grown as either intercrops or sole crops were substantially affected by the P level in the soil ( For common bean, the MBC stock was significantly greater in the rhizosphere of both intercropped and sole cropped common bean than in fallow soil ( For maize, MBC stock in the rhizosphere was significantly higher in the intercrop than in either the sole crop or fallow only for -P soil ( For common bean, MBN stock was significantly higher for intercropping than sole crop and fallow soil with a greater effect for -P soils (+25% in the first year and +10% in the second year) than for + P soils (+16% and +7%, respectively) ( The soil microbial C:N ratio was significantly lower in both sole crops and intercrops than in the fallow ( For both common bean and maize, the total soil respiration in both years was higher in-P soil (between 0.7 and 1.75 g C-CO The correlations between NN stocks and MBN stock ( The relationship between soil respiration and NC stock was determined by linear regression ( This study showed that NN stock in intercropped common bean was significantly higher compared to the sole crop in both years ( Previous studies The NC stock was lower in the -P soil than in the +P soil, this may be explained by the C transfer from the nodules to the atmosphere as CO Previous studies have shown the beneficial effects of intercropping common bean and maize in P-deficient soils in north-eastern Algerian agroecosystems. In fact, this study showed that MBN stock was much higher for intercrops than for the corresponding sole crops and fallow ( The carbon of the soil from the microbial biomass was higher in intercropping than in sole crops and fallow and even more in P-deficient soil for intercropped maize. Carbon is a major factor limiting the growth and development of microorganisms while for plants the limiting factor is nitrogen The C:N ratio of the microbial biomass is an important indicator of the nutritional balance of the microorganisms. If C:N is high, nitrogen becomes limiting factor for the microorganisms so that they compete with the plants for nitrogen Under the low-P conditions of our soil, these results suggest that soil respiration can also occur as a consequence of microbial activity simulations, as a result of a shift in the nutritional (eg. C and N) balance of the microorganisms. Thus, the soil microbial community in return provides the plants with mineral elements, made available by microbial activities (mineralization, storage and recycling). Recent studies suggest that other mechanism patterns, i.e. enzyme activity, may show at least similar increases in soil respiration as those found in this study, through their effect on either soil functions (e.i. C, N and P mobilization abilities) or soil properties Resource availability may have determined the microbial biomass and its C:N ratio in the fallow soil, whereas more complex processes, such as predation or phage dynamics, may also have been involved in the rhizosphere, especially in the case of intercrops. However, for legume species, enzyme activities hold an important role in the mobilization of both MBC and MBN stock and subsequent increase P availability for plant acquisition, either via the nitrification or the mineralization processes In conclusion, this study has highlighted the impact of intercropping in Algerian P-deficient soils on the enrichment of the rhizosphere in organic matter that could restore the fertility of Algerian soils and consequently have an effect on the yield of agricultural production and the economy of the country. Indeed, the main results showed that, in P-deficiency conditions, intercropping gave the highest increases in MBC and MBN stock than in sole crops and fallow. In the same conditions, the highest total soil respiration in the rhizosphere was noted and the C:N ratio of the microbial biomass was lower in the rhizosphere of intercropped maize than in the sole crops. Also, one of the important results found is the strong correlation established between C stock from nodule (NC) and MBC stock in intercropping, especially in P-deficient soils. P deficiency could cause a stress in the plant inducing probably an increase in symbiotic nitrogen fixation which in turn increases P availability in the soil. This could probably enrich the rhizosphere of legumes with organic matter thereby increasing MBC and MBN stock. The enriched rhizosphere microbial community contributes to SOM mineralization, which in turn could stimulate rhizodeposition and plant growth. The relationships between biological N We can conclude that in low P soils conditions, intercropping could be an effective solution and could replace fallow system in Algeria, which is not currently practiced as a traditional fallow that can improve the soil with input of organic matter.
