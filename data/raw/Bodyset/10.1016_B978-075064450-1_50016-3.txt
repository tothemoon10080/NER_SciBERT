This chapter presents electronic ore principles and ore sorting—the original concentration process—that has probably been used by the earliest metal workers several thousand years ago. It involves the appraisal of individual ore particles and the rejection of those particles that do not warrant further treatment. Hand sorting has been declined in importance because of the need to treat large quantities of low-grade ore that requires extremely fine grinding. Hand sorting of some kind, however, is still practiced at some mines, even though it may only be the removal of large pieces of timber and tramp iron from the run-of-mine ore. Sorting can be applied to pre-concentration, in which barren waste is eliminated to reduce the tonnage reporting to the downstream concentration processes, such as in uranium or gold ore sorting, or to the production of a final product such as in limestone or diamond sorting.
