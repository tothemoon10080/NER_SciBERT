In present paper GPU acceleration modeling and Streamline based reactive transport simulation for uranium In-Situ leaching process is studied. In-Situ leaching (ISL) is a method of selective dissolution of mineral inside of rock by injection of leaching solution to the layer through the wells and chemical interaction of leaching solution with ore. Changing of flow rates on wells over time leads to increasing computational time and simulation of In-Situ leaching problem becomes resource-intensive problem. Acceleration of the hydrodynamic of the ISL process is carried out on GPU; parallelization of reactive mass transport due to reaction of leaching solute with mineral is performed by with multi-threading and streamlines simulation.
