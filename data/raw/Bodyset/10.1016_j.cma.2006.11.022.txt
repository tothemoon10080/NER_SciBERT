In this paper we describe error estimates for a finite element approximation to partial differential systems describing two-phase immiscible flows in porous media, with applications to heap leaching of copper ores. These approximations are based on mixed finite element (MFE) methods for the pressure and velocity and finite volume (FV) for the saturation. The fluids are considered incompressible. Numerical results for heap leaching simulation are presented.We can use the knowledge, experience and physical intuition accumulated in the hydrological sciences and petroleum engineering to simulate, optimize and improve heap leaching operations today. Leaching is a mass transfer process between the leaching solution (fluid phase) and the ore bed (solid phase) In this paper, we study the convergence of a numerical scheme for the fluid flow model. We use the classical two-phase flow equations, which can be rewritten in differential formulations so that the coupling and nonlinearity are weakened. These formulations include, phase, global, and weighted formulations. We consider the global formulation, specifically, the fractional flow formulation for two-phase immiscible and incompressible fluids. It is well known that advective transport in diffusive effects dominates for two-phase flow equations in porous media. Hence, it is important to obtain accurate approximate fluid velocities. This motivates the use of mixed finite element methods for the computation of pressure and velocity, due to the convection–diffusion control of the saturation equation, efficient and accurate approximations should be used to solve this equation. On the other hand, finite volume methods should be considered for the computation of the leaching equation, resolving shock fronts in a proper manner. MFE–FV schemes for two phase flow models were first proposed by Durlofsky A more detailed and extensive review of different numerical methods for classical two phase equations, for immiscible and incompressible flow, can be found in the paper of Chavent and Jaffré The aim of this paper is to study convergence for the two phase flow system with applications to heap leaching of copper ores. This is done by proving an a priori error estimate. Our proof follows the main ideas of Ohlberger The paper is organized as follows. In Section In this section we present the classical two phase immiscible and incompressible flow equations for the fluid flow problem in the context of Heap Leaching. Next, we define a fractional flow formulation for the degenerate and non-degenerate case in a weak form. Finally, we define a model problem for our convergence analysis. In this paper we consider two dimensional geometry, Eqs. Summing Rather than a saturation, a complementary pressure was introduced by Chen Define the spaces as Under physically reasonable assumptions on the data and the assumption that In Heap Leaching it is physically reasonable to assume that a residual saturation Let We follow a classical notation for unstructured grid for VF and MFE-VF methods used previously in  For  For any angle There exists Additionally, we shall use the following notation for the unstructured triangulation:         If        For any variable Furthermore, we shall use the following notation for the time discretization: Finally, let If Let For fixed We consider a cell centered finite volume scheme for the Eq.
