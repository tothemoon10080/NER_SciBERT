Titanate nanotubes were synthesized by hydrothermal method at 105°C for 24h (setting temperature) using natural leucoxene mineral as the starting material. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The prepared nanotubes showed internal diameter of 4-6nm, external diameter of 8-10nm, and the length of 0.2-1μm. This synthesis method provided a simple route to fabricate nanostructured material from low cost natural mineral using Thai autoclave unit.
