The reduction of barium sulfate to produce barium sulfide is a part of the two-step process for converting sulfur dioxide to elemental sulfur, described in Part I. This reaction was investigated using a thermogravimetric analysis technique with and without an impregnated nickel catalyst at reaction temperatures between 700 and

                      under a hydrogen partial pressure of 86.7kPa. The Prout–Tompkins nucleation and growth kinetics equation was found to be useful for describing the rate of this reaction, which had an activation energy of 210kJ/mol for fresh barium sulfate powder and 143kJ/mol for fresh nickel-catalyzed barium sulfate powder. The reduction reaction of nickel-catalyzed barium sulfate powder is of order 0.6 with respect to hydrogen partial pressure.A novel process for converting sulfur dioxide to elemental sulfur by a cyclic reaction scheme involving barium sulfide and barium sulfate has been developed, as described in Part I of this series ( The advantage of this process is that the gaseous product from Reaction (2) is essentially pure sulfur and that from Reaction (1) is water vapor. The solids are reused without generating much secondary solid wastes. The thermodynamic feasibility for this scheme was established ( Experiments were carried out in a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) unit described in detail elsewhere ( The results of kinetics measurement on the reaction of catalyzed and uncatalyzed samples are presented below, followed by interpretation of the experimental results. The measurement was carried out under conditions such that the overall rate is controlled by chemical kinetics, and gas phase mass transfer does not play a significant role. The mass transfer effects were eliminated by reducing the thickness of the sample layer and increasing the gas flow rate until neither had an effect on the overall reaction rate, as described in Part I ( Preliminary experiments were carried out in a horizontal tubular reactor to see if the reaction indeed follows the thermodynamic predictions of producing mostly barium sulfide as the solid product and water vapor. The runs were carried out in a horizontal tube furnace. For the The effect of reaction temperature was investigated, first using the starting uncatalyzed barium sulfate sample, by varying the temperature in the range 900– Because nickel was found to substantially enhance the rate of the hydrogen reduction of calcium sulfate ( By comparing the results in The effect of hydrogen partial pressure was tested on the nickel-catalyzed barium sulfate powder. The test was performed only on the catalyzed sample because it is much more reactive and thus was used as the main reactant. Hydrogen partial pressure ranged from 20 to 100% at the total atmospheric pressure of 86.7 As shown in It was previously shown that the catalytic effect of nickel stayed intact over the ten cycles tested for the hydrogen reduction of calcium sulfate ( Sigmoidal conversion-vs.-time curves are characterized by an initial induction period, followed by an acceleratory stage in which the rate increases before falling off in the final stage. This behavior may be interpreted as arising from the formation of nuclei at various sites on the crystal, followed by the growth and coalescence of these nuclei. The following equation according to Prout and Tompkins is sometimes used to describe a reaction when such a process dominates the conversion of a solid ( A number of different rate expressions including the shrinking-core expression and the Erofeev nucleation-and-growth equation found to be applicable for other gas–solid reactions ( This nucleation and growth rate equation is similar to, yet distinct from, Erofeev's equation that best described the hydrogen reduction of calcium sulfate ( Define the experimental starting zero time as closely as possible despite the above-mentioned uncertainties. Plot the experimental data according to Eq. Determine Calculate the value of X corresponding to This was carried out with the experimental data in this work. For the uncatalyzed barium sulfate, only The results for the uncatalyzed starting barium sulfate are summarized in For the Ni-catalyzed barium sulfate, the data obtained under various hydrogen partial pressures in The reduction of barium sulfate to produce barium sulfide is part of the two-step process for converting sulfur dioxide to elemental sulfur. The kinetics of this reaction was investigated using a thermogravimetric analysis technique with and without an impregnated nickel catalyst. The nickel catalyst greatly enhances the rate of the reduction of barium sulfate with hydrogen, with almost complete conversion to barium sulfide in 3
