All C, D, E C, E A, B 1G, 2A, 3H, 4C, 5E, 6D, 7F, 8B  The prevalence of Dupuytren's disease varies between populations with the highest prevalence in the Caucasian population in Northern Europe. Recent evidence suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with variable penetrance.  The rotator cuff consists of four muscles which arise from the scapula and insert onto the proximal humerus. The incidence of rotator cuff tears increases with age and studies in cadavers shown an incidence of rotator cuff tears in 30% cases. The majority of cuff tears are posterosuperior involving the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons.  Traditionally, most humeral shaft fractures have been treated conservatively. Proximal humeral fractures are common, accounting for 4–5% of all fractures and are principally associated with osteoporosis. For recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation, soft tissue stabilization with an arthroscopic repair is undertaken as long as the glenoid is not too damaged.
