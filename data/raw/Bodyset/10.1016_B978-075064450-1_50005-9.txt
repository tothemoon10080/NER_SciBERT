This chapter explains the metallurgical accounting, control, and its simulation. Metallurgical accounting is an essential feature of all efficient metallurgical operations. Not only is it used to determine the distribution of the various products of a concentrator and the values contained in them but it is also used to make decisions about the operation since the values of recovery and grade obtained from the accounting procedure are indications of process efficiency. It is necessary to collect reliable data from the process to perform successful metallurgical accounting. The chapter deals with the collection, analysis, and use of process data. The essential requirements of a good accounting and control system are efficient and representative sampling of the process streams, upon which accurate analyses of the value components can be undertaken, and reliable and accurate measurement of the mass flow rate of important flow streams. Computer control of mineral processing plants requires continuous measurement of such parameters. Computer simulation is increasingly being used to aid circuit design and optimization and is likely to be a major future use of the computer in mineral processing. A balanced approach to decision-making requires commercial data in addition to technical data. It is worth noting that matching cost reporting areas to process areas and equipment greatly assist in matching technical and commercial data. A reasonably close match makes it much easier to estimate the potential costs and benefits of process changes.
