This paper describes a static flow sheet simulation model developed for the pilot scale mineral beneficiation plant taken recently into use at University of Oulu, Finland. The mini-pilot plant aims to serve as a research platform for students and researchers from universities, mining companies, and other organizations in the field of mining and mineral engineering. Currently, the mini-pilot plant is set up according to the concentrator plant at the Pyhäsalmi deposit but can be configured for different types of ores and beneficiation processes as well. The simulator is built using the HSC Sim® simulation software. The simulator will support research and development of the new mini-pilot line. It can also be used in process design and optimisation. This paper presents preliminary results demonstrating the promising potential of the simulation model for replicating the pilot process behaviour. The future aim is to convert the static model into dynamic operating mode and study different control scenarios of mineral beneficiation plants using the simulator.
