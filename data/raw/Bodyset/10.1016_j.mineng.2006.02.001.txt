The removal of heavy metals from dilute aqueous solutions (in the range of 10−7–10−4
                     moldm−3) is often not acceptable using classical methods, which do not achieve levels in accordance with environmental quality standards. Electroflotation has certain desirable characteristics, compared to dissolved and dispersed air flotation, particularly in regard to the small bubble size distribution of the process. The aim of this work was to develop an electroflotation (EF)/electrocoagulation (EC) cell to study this combined process and the influence of some relevant parameters/variables, such as collector concentration, tension and current density variation, on the removal of zinc from synthetic solutions containing 20mgl−1 of the metal. A platinum gore (5mm) anode and stainless steel mesh cathode were used in the electroflotation cell. The work showed that it was possible to remove zinc by electroflotation, 96% removal being achieved using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as collector in the stoichiometric ratio 1:3, current density of around 8mA/cm2 and an inlet pH of about 7.0.Electroflotation (EF) is a simple process that floats pollutants (or other substances) by their adhesion onto tiny bubbles of hydrogen and oxygen generated from electrolysis of aqueous solutions ( Considering the increasing importance of EF as a tool for environmental applications, the aim of this work was to develop and build an experimental apparatus, operating continuously, in order to treat any liquid effluent, combining two unit operations (EF and EC) into a single device and, in particular, to electrofloat Zn The performance of an EF system is assessed by the pollutant removal efficiency and the power and/or chemical consumptions. The bubble size distribution depends on the solution pH as well as the electrode material ( Using a buffer solution, The gas bubbles are also influenced by the current density ( The key to floatability of chemical species in liquid streams is hydrophobicity, the ratio of collector to metal ion being an important factor. The amount of collector used in ion flotation should be at least stoichiometric if it has frother properties (  The complete procedure has been described elsewhere ( The reagents used in the experiments were: Zinc sulfate (ZnSO Sodium sulfate (Na Sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) (C Ethanol (C H    Previous work on ion flotation have indicated that the use of specific stoichiometric ratios of collectors ( It is observed ( Similar results can be found elsewhere.  It was feasible to remove up to 96% of the zinc by EF. The predominant zinc ionic species, Zn The authors acknowledge the financial support from CNPq, CAPES and FAPERJ.
