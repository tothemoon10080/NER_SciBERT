In this paper, a novel surfactant, N-(6-(hydroxyamino)-6-oxohexyl)decanamide (NHOD) was synthesized and used as a collector for flotation separation of diaspore and aluminosilicate minerals. The adsorption mechanism of NHOD onto diaspore was also investigated by FTIR spectra, zeta potential measurement and XPS. The flotation results demonstrated that NHOD exhibited superior collecting power to diaspore and selectivity against kaolinite and illite and could effectively realize flotation recovery of diaspore from bauxite ores contained aluminosilicate minerals under neutral conditions. The results of XPS, FTIR spectra and zeta potential illustrated that at around pH 7.0, NHOD might chemisorb on diaspore surfaces through AlO coordination bonds formed by binding its C(O)NHOH or C(O)NH chelate groups with aluminum atoms on diaspore surfaces. NHOD's unique properties, such as characteristic bond patterns onto diaspore surfaces, two hydrophobic groups, and intermolecular hydrogen bonds between neighboring NHOD molecules coated on diaspore surfaces, rendered it to be a superior flotation collector for diaspore.Bauxites in China are mainly diasporic resources with a distinct disadvantage of low Al The reason why hydroxamic acids own strong collecting capacity is that they contain In this paper, a novel surfactant N-(6-(hydroxyamino)-6-oxohexyl) decanamide (NHOD), which contains amide and hydroxamic groups, was prepared and used as diaspore collector. Its flotation performances for diaspore, kaolinite and illite were evaluated by single and bench-scale flotation tests. Moreover, the adsorption mechanism of NHOD onto diaspore surfaces was also investigated by FTIR spectra, zeta potential and XPS. The understanding of the role of amide or hydroxamic groups in flotation recovery of diaspore provided a new insight into the structure–property relationship of flotation collector. Hand-picked diaspore (Mianchi, Henan province), kaolinite and illite (Qingtian and Ouhai, Zhejiang province) were obtained from the Geological Museum of China. They were 90% pure based on X-ray diffraction and chemical analysis. The elemental analysis results were listed in NHOD was synthesized in our laboratory, and its structure was confirmed by IR, NMR and LC-MS. IR spectra were recorded through a thin neat film on an AVATAR360 FTIR instrument (Nicolet, USA). Flotation tests were carried out by using a XFG5-35 flotation machine (mechanical agitation) with a 40 Bench-scale flotation tests were performed in XFD-63 flotation cells (self aeration) whose volume was 1.0 The infrared spectra of experimental samples were recorded by an AVATAR360 FTIR spectrometer. 50 Zeta potentials of wolframite were measured by JS94H electrophoresis apparatus trophoresis (Beckman Coulter INC, America). 40 The XPS of diaspore before and after NHOD treatment were recorded on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi using Al Kα X-ray source operated at 200 N-(6-(hydroxyamino)-6-oxohexyl)decanamide (NHOD) surfactant was synthesized by using caprolactam, n-decanoic acid and hydroxylamine hydrochloride as starting materials and its synthesis route was listed in Product characterization: N-(6-(hydroxyamino)-6-oxohexyl)decanamide (  The influence of NHOD's dosage on floatation recoveries of diaspore, kaolinite and illite at pH The results of locked-cycle flotation tests were presented in The FTIR spectra of NHOD and NHOD-Al After reaction with aluminum ions, the O After NHOD treatment ( The X-ray penetration depth in XPS measurement is several nanometers of sample surfaces. As mineral samples adsorbed collectors were repeatedly rinsed before XPS measurements, it was reasonable to assume that any loosely adsorbed collectors were washed off from mineral surfaces, so the interface layers probed by XPS were composed by mineral interface and its adsorbed collector species The atomic compositions of diaspore, kaolinite and illite interfaces treated or untreated by NHOD were listed in The Al2p XPS of the three minerals before and after NHOD treatment was listed in The change values of atomic concentration for Al, O, C and N in The zeta potential of diaspore particles as a function of pH in the absence and presence of NHOD was presented in Diaspore [α-AlO(OH)] consists of hexagonal close-packed oxygen sheets with aluminum atoms filling two-thirds of the octahedral interstice sites Kaolinite [Al NHOD contains double hydrophilic groups ( In the acidic pulp (pH Under pH 6–9, NHOD species is dominated in aqueous solutions, At pH At around pH 7.0, NHOD exhibited the best flotation performances to diaspore ( In this study, a novel surfactant, N-(6-(hydroxyamino)-6-oxohexyl)decanamide (NHOD) was synthesized and its flotation performance and adsorption mechanism to diaspore were first investigated by FTIR spectra, flotation tests, zeta potential and XPS measurements. Based on the experimental findings, the following conclusion may be drawn as: The flotation results demonstrated that NHOD exhibited superior collecting power to diaspore and selectivity against kaolinite and illite and could effectively realize flotation recovery of diaspore from bauxite ores contained aluminosilicate minerals under neutral conditions. The results of XPS, FTIR spectra and zeta potential illustrated that at around pH 7.0, NHOD might chemisorb on diaspore surfaces through Al-O coordination bonds formed by binding its NHOD's unique properties, such as characteristic bond patterns onto diaspore surfaces, two hydrophobic groups, and intermolecular hydrogen bonds between neighboring NHOD molecules coated on diaspore surfaces, rendered it to be a superior flotation collector for diaspore.
