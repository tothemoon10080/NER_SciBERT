In order to analyze the stability of the underground rock structures, knowing the sensitivity of geomechanical parameters is important. To investigate the priority of these geomechanical properties in the stability of cavern, a sensitivity analysis has been performed on a single cavern in various rock mass qualities according to RMR using Phase 2. The stability of cavern has been studied by investigating the side wall deformation. Results showed that most sensitive properties are coefficient of lateral stress and modulus of deformation. Also parameters of Hoek–Brown criterion and σc
                      have no sensitivity when cavern is in a perfect elastic state. But in an elasto-plastic state, parameters of Hoek–Brown criterion and σc
                      affect the deformability; such effect becomes more remarkable with increasing plastic area. Other parameters have different sensitivities concerning rock mass quality (RMR). Results have been used to propose the best set of parameters for study on prediction of sidewall displacement.
