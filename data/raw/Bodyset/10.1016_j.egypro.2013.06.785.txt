Flower-like structure titanate and titania on titanium plate substrate composed of nanowires were synthesized by hydrothermal method at 150 oC for 2h using titanium plate substrate as the starting material. The crystalline structure, shape and size of the prepared sample were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). SEM images showed flower-like structure with uniform size about 2Î¼m. The flower-like structure composed of nanowires with diameter about 20-50nm. Titanate and titania could be controlled by washing process and calcination temperature. This synthesis method provides a simple route to fabricate nanostructured titanate and titania on titanium plate substrate for dye-sensitized solar cell and photocatalytic activity applications.
