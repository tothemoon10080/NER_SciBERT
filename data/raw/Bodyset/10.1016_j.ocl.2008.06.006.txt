Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) has a successful clinical record when used for treatment of arthropathy accompanied by rotator cuff insufficiency. Efforts to use the same technology for other conditions involving insufficient cuff function are related to proximal humeral fracture described in this review for which RSA has shown promise are treatment of failed hemiarthroplasty for treatment of proximal humeral fractures and treatment of complex fracture sequelae. Specific conclusions as yet are difficult to reach. Future studies are needed to determine if supplemental soft tissue procedures or modification of implant design will serve to improve functional outcome in this difficult-to-treat subset of patients.
