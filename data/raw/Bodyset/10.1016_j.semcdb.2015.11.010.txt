At the core of the biomineralization discipline is the inspiration for research drawn from diverse tissues presenting minerals synthesised by a living organism. These minerals can be found in the most diverse contexts, and are produced by a wide variety of cells and organisms. In this issue, we aim to go beyond the effort of describing the mechanism of formation of mineral in a biological context: our objective is to draw attention to this biological diversity. In this way, we start with an in-depth discussion on some of the biological systems able to produce minerals formed by calcium carbonate, ranging from nacre (on the paper “ We then move to diatoms which are able to synthesize minerals based on silicon dioxide, on the paper “ Following the exploration of biominerals formed by calcium carbonate, silica and iron oxide, we move towards systems closer to our own, such as the minerals formed by calcium phosphate present in bones, on the paper “ Last but not least, we discuss a system where the formation of a biomineral composed of calcium phosphate occurs in a pathological context, on the paper “ The diversity of topics presented here reflects the breadth of biomineralization research topics. We hope this collection of papers will inspire new research in this fascinating multidisciplinary field that has its origins in biology but has a much broader impact today, reaching distinct disciplines, such as medicine, chemistry, geology, materials science and physics.
