I am writing regarding the article “Open intercondylar fractures of the distal humerus: Management using a mini-external fixator construct” by Chaudhary et al. First, they don't describe where the wounds were. We have found that most of such wounds are in the posterior aspect of the arm and are typically made by the shaft of the humerus, which protrudes through the extensor mechanism and the skin as the elbow hits the ground and the condyles break away. Was this also their experience? Second, how did they deal with intra-articular comminution? We have found that often such open fractures tend to be quite comminuted, and it is extremely difficult to hold smaller articular fragments in place with Kirschner wires alone. How did the authors deal with this problem? Finally, we disagree that open reduction and internal fixation may be suboptimal in this setting. We have previously published an article, We thank the authors for their contribution to the knowledge regarding this challenging fracture.
