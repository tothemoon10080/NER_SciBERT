One Pb–0.25%Ag–0.1%Ca alloy anode and three commercial Pb–0.6%Ag, Pb–0.58%Ag and Pb–0.69%Ag alloys anodes have been studied by conventional electrochemical methods and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in acid zinc sulphate electrolyte with and without MnSO4 additions to evaluate their activity and corrosion behaviour. At a current density of 50mAcm−
                     2 and 38°C, the polished surface of the anode Pb–0.69%Ag alloy had the lowest overpotential, followed closely by that of anodes Pb–0.6%Ag and Pb–0.58%Ag alloys and then anode Pb–0.25%Ag–0.1%Ca alloy in a bath with and without MnSO4 additions. Also, during potential decay period after 5h electrolysis, the polished surfaces showed that anode Pb–0.69%Ag alloy had the lowest corrosion current among the four examined anodes, followed by anodes Pb–0.6%Ag, Pb–0.25%Ag–0.1%Ca alloys and Pb–0.58%Ag alloy.Even though lead is the anode material of choice in many major electrowinning processes, such as copper, zinc, and manganese, there are some difficulties in their use that can create problems; one is concerned with the incorporation of lead corrosion products in the deposit at the cathode which decrease the purity. Also the oxygen overpotential is relatively high to increase the cell voltage and decrease energy efficiency. Due to these problems there is always interest in finding ways to improve anode performance and minimize the corrosion and overpotential problems ( Small amounts of Ag (0.7–1.0%) alloyed with lead decrease the oxygen overvoltage, and increase the corrosion resistance of material. A well established custom in all electrolytic zinc plants is to use Pb–Ag alloys containing 0.7–1.0% Ag as the anode material. The resulting benefits are a longer anode life and a lower Pb content in the cathodic zinc ( The electrochemical behaviour of the anode during the zinc electrowinning is very important for the anodic reactions as well as for the quality of zinc deposit. Potentiodynamic measurements, galvanostatic and impedance spectroscopic techniques were used to investigate the electrochemical behaviour of three Pb–Ag alloys and one Pb–Ag–Ca alloys with different miscrostructures. By comparing these results, the lead electrode for the zinc electrowinning industry having the lowest corrosion rate, the lowest overpotential and best stability during polarisation, after polarisation (potential decay) and at the open-circuit potential studies could be chosen. The aim of this work is to use the electrochemical measurements to study the performance of different Pb–Ag anodes during and after electrowinning and relate that to their metallurgical properties especially the mode of fabrication as far as possible. The composition of the electrolyte used in this work is as follows: Zn Zinc sulphate (ZnSO The anodes used in this work were made of laminated Pb–Ag and Pb–Ag–Ca alloys. The anode #1 is a Pb–0.25%Ag–0.1%Ca alloy; the anodes #2 and #3 are Pb–0.6%Ag alloys, while anode #4 is a Pb–0.7%Ag alloy. Their chemical composition is given in The middle bulks and original surfaces of the four anodes were used. The cathodes were made of platinum for corrosion rate measurements. The Pb–Ag alloy anodes plates were cut into small pieces of 1 The electrolytic cell comprised a 1 The measurements of the overpotentials of the four polished anodes were carried out by galvanostatic polarization at a current density of 50 Four runs of the evolution of the overpotentials of anodic reaction of the polished anode #3 in acid zinc sulphate electrolyte containing 8 The standard Generally, industrial acid zinc sulphate electrolyte contains 100  At the end of the electrolysis, the overpotentials of the anodes #4, #2, #3 and #1 were 689, 697, 706, and 742 As shown in The overpotentials for the four polished anodes were measured at a current density of 50 The curves of the four polished anodes had the same trend, but fluctuations are less important due possibly to the absence of Mn Comparing The polarization resistance of the anode reaction of the four polished anodes #1, #2, #3 and #4 during electrolysis at 50 The overpotentials of anode were measured at different current densities in acid zinc sulphate electrolyte containing 8 It is seen that the overpotentials of the polished anode #4 at galvanostatically polarized current densities 40, 50 and 60 After galvanostatic polarization, the corrosion potential decay of 1  Seen from It can be observed from Comparing The electrolyte contains Mn So a dense non-conductive MnO In this work, when the working electrode was introduced into the cell, the galvanostatic polarization was started immediately and was preformed for 5  The data of the 4 Comparing The Nyquist plots of the fourth cycle EIS measurement following the galvanostatic polarization at 50 The data of the four cycles are shown in Comparing The electrochemical behaviour of the polished anode #4 has been shown in acid zinc sulphate electrolyte containing 8 The overpotentials of the polished anode #4 in acid zinc sulphate electrolyte with the variation of concentrations 8, 10 and 12 It is seen from Corrosion rates of the four polished anodes after the galvanostatic polarization followed by the potential decay were calculated from the polarization curves, the results are shown in As shown in Combinations of the results of It is seen from The current density is an important factor for electrochemical behaviour of the polished anode #4 in acid zinc sulphate electrolyte containing 8 From The corrosion behaviour of the polished anode #4 was conducted at different temperatures. From Before the four anodes were polished, there is an oxide film formed on the original surface. The four original surfaces of the anodes were polarization for 5 Comparing the Comparable experiments were carried out in the electrolyte containing 8 From the above results, the polished surfaces show that anode #4 had the best corrosion resistance among the four anodes during galvanostatic control in the bath containing permanganate ion at a current density of 50  It is also found that anode #1 had the lest silver content among the four anodes, although addition of silver at the range of 0.5–1.0% is good at decrease the corrosion rate but the polished surface of anode #1 had higher corrosion resistance than that of anode #3 during potential decay after 5  The following conclusions can be drawn from this study: At a current density of 50 During galvanostatic control in the bath containing permanganate ions at a current density of 50 During the potential decay period: The original anodes had lower corrosion current than the polished anodes in acid zinc sulphate electrolyte without MnSO With the temperature and current density increase, the corrosion rates of Pb–Ag anodes increased. The four polished anodes in the acid zinc sulphate electrolyte containing MnSO The corrosion rates of the four anodes decreased with the potential decay time. The higher decay potential leads to the higher corrosion rate for all anodes with polished surfaces in a bath with and without MnSO The results of EIS measurements show that the anode Pb–0.69%Ag alloy had the highest polarization resistance among the four anodes, followed by the anodes Pb–0.6%Ag, Pb–0.58%Ag and Pb–0.25%Ag–0.1%Ca alloys in a bath with and without MnSO The authors would like to express his utmost appreciation to his principal supervisor, Professor Ghali, for his valuable advice and dedication, and thank Dr. Jin for his advice and help.
