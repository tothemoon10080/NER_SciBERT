The aim of the study is to find the best model of triple obstacle for modifying of biodiesel reactor by non-catalytic method to increase the reaction rate of biodiesel production. Biodiesel is produced by trans-esterification reaction of oil and methanol. Superheated-methanol-vapour in the bubble column reactor as one of Non-catalytic method is used to produce biodiesel. Based on the analysis, the best configuration of obstacle having 52 holes 4mm in diameter which spread on the top, middle and bottom of reactor obtained biodiesel production rate of 0.026g · min–1 and the content of biodiesel of 89.9%.
