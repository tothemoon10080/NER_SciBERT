The sample of the (FeNb2O6) iron niobate was synthesized from FeC2O4·2H2O and Nb2O5 mixture. According to XRD it was a single-phase sample with the columbite structure and unit cell parameters: a = 14.2662(2) Å; b = 5.7341(1) Å; c = 5.0497(1) Å; V = 413.08(1) Å3. Heat capacity over the temperature range of 323–1193 K, temperatures and heats of phase transformations in the range of 303–1753 K were measured in an inert atmosphere with combined thermogravimetry and calorimetry using NETZSCH STA 449C Jupiter thermoanalyzer. Experimental heat capacity of FeNb2O6 was fitted to Сp = 198.68 + 0.001·35.92 T-31.86·105 T−2-11.98·10−6·T2 equation. The value of the Cp,m,298(FeNb2O6) = 172.5 ± 1.7 J mol−1 K−1 was calculated based on the equation. The phase transformation at the temperature of 1630 ± 3 K and at the enthalpy of ΔH1 = 7.20 ± 0.37 kJ mol−1 was the FeNb2O6 transformation from the orthorhombic crystal structure to the tetragonal one. The endothermic effect at 1693 ± 3 K and the enthalpy of ΔH2 = 72.49 ± 3.61 kJ mol−1 was related to the melting of FeNb2O6.Iron niobate of FeNb Existence of 4FeO·Nb According to The aim of this study was the measurement of high-temperature heat capacity of FeNb The synthesis of FeNb Phase composition of the synthesized sample of FeNb Experiments of measurement of the specific heat capacity of FeNb According to ASTM standard Temperatures and enthalpy of phase transformations of FeNb According to the X-ray diffraction analysis, the single-phase FeNb Experimental values of the temperatures of the phase transformations of the FeNb Series of experiments on the determination of the specific heat capacity of sapphire (C The results of measurement of the heat capacity of FeNb The calculated value of C The value of C Values of H Results of the calculations of values of H Single-phase FeNb It was shown, that at heating of FeNb This work was performed as part of the State plan of the IMET UB RAS (№0396-2015-0082) on the equipment of the common center (Ural-M).
