In this paper, in order to study the interaction mechanism of non-polar oil assisted dodecylamine (DDA) flotation of quartz, the particle-oil drops system were treated the same as the hydrophobic particles system. Pure dodecane was chosen as research object, the interfacial interactions between quartz particle and oil drop were investigated through calculation of the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (EDLVO) potential energy profile. Based on the calculations of the van der Waals attractive interaction potential, hydrophobic interaction potential, hydrocarbon chain association potential, and electrostatic interaction potential, the results indicated that the mineral particle and oil drop attachment state was mainly dominated by hydrophobic interaction potential. In the modification of oil agglomeration flotation process, the adsorption of DDA on the dodecane/water interface presented significant effects on the interfacial interactions between quartz particle and oil drop. It was found that the adsorption of DDA at dodecane/water interface changed the zeta potential value of oil drop from negative to positive. In this case, the attachment of the particles would occur spontaneously, which was due to the contribution of electric double layer attractive interaction. On the contrary, in the traditional oil agglomeration flotation process, a mechanical agitation was required to overcome a potential barrier due to the existence of electric double layer repulsive interaction between the negatively charged oil drops and mineral particles. This study was focus on the theoretical level, and provided some insights into mechanism of oil agglomeration flotation.Non-polar oils, such as kerosene, diesel, soybean and rapeseed oil has been widely used as collectors or bridging reagents in the traditional flotation and oil agglomeration flotation process ( In the traditional oil agglomeration flotation process, the hydrophobic particles are agglomerated in an aqueous medium by bridging liquid (non-polar oils) which is immiscible with water, whereas the hydrophilic particles remain in the suspension ( The basic principles of oil agglomeration flotation and effects of various operating parameters have been investigated by many researchers, and the technique has been used in the mineral industry for the purification of many different types of minerals such as naturally hydrophobic coal ( Theoretical analysis as well as experimental measurements reveals that the various phases such as oil density and viscosity, oil concentration, flotation medium pH, stirring time and intensity greatly influence the flotation process ( In our previous work, a modification of oil agglomeration flotation has been proposed, which is based on introduction of the premixed combination of DDA and kerosene as the collector ( In this paper, in order to investigate the interfacial interactions between quartz particles and oil droplets, pure dodecane was chose as oil component representative to investigate the interfacial interactions between quartz particle and oil drop through calculation of the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (EDLVO) potential energy profile. Here, the pure dodecane chose as research objects was because kerosene was a mixture of different structure of alkane, olefin and cycloalkane, and it can be expected that it was difficult to calculate the interfacial interactions between these complicated mixture and quartz particle. Furthermore, the interaction of dodecane oil drop and quartz particle can be analogous to other non-polar oil systems for the similar calculation process. The effects of the interaction between dodecane and DDA on the interfacial interactions of the quartz-dodecane system, and the influence to the relationships between hydrophobic attraction and surface properties were further studied. On the basic of viewpoint from energetics aspect, this research provides some valuable insights into mechanism of oil agglomeration flotation, for instance, which force dominates between mineral particles and oil droplet, and how collector adsorption affect interfacial interactions. And in addition, this investigation would aid industrial applications of this traditional technology. In this work pure quartz (SiO Flotation tests have been carried out in a XFG-1.5IV flotation machine with 1.5 The zeta potential measurements of mineral particles and oil drop were carried out by using a JS94H micro-electrophoresis apparatus of Powereach. The concentration of 0.3 The size distribution of the quartz particle and oil droplets were determined by using a S3500 particle size analyzer of Microtrac. The oil emulsion was prepared by mixing dodecane or primixed DDA-dodecane with water in the concentration of 1 DDA adsorption was measured by UV–Vis spectrometer with Eosin Y as indicator and its adsorption at the mineral and oil/water interface was calculated by the Gibbs adsorption formula ( The amount of adsorbed DDA was calculated using the expression: In order to investigate the effect on the quartz flotability of the dodecane addition manner, the flotation result of quartz by using premixed DDA and dodecane (premixed DDA-dodecane), DDA and dodecane emulsion (dodecane added after DDA) as collector was shown in In order to understand the activity of premixed DDA-dodecane droplets, the volume particle size distribution of emulsion was determined. In order to investigate the surface charge character activity of premixed DDA-dodecane droplets, the electrokinetics of premixed DDA-dodecane emulsion and pure dodecane emulsion was measured, and the results were shown in The results showed that addition of cationic surfactant DDA to the dodecane emulsion changed the zeta potential value from negative to positive; moreover, a uniform and smaller emulsion was formed. In order to investigated how this modification affect the interfacial interactions between quartz particles and oil droplets clearly, according to EDLVO theory, the interaction potential energies between an oil drop and a quartz particle was calculated under this experimental condition. On the basic of our previous paper in detail ( Known from previous study, it is reasonable to treat the oil drops as tiny hydrophobic liquid particles and assume that the geometrical shape of mineral particles and oil drops are all spheres ( For spherical particles,the van der Waals interaction potential between them can be represented as Eq. For particles with hydrophobic surface, the hydrophobic interaction energy U Therefore, the hydrophobic interaction potential can be calculated as Eq. If the approaching length of mineral particle and oil drop are longer than the surfactant ion length, but within twice as long as the surfactant ion length ( Here, V is the overlap volume of the DDA layer and oil drop when their distance is h (0 ∅ is the standard free energy change which attribute to the transportation process of each − Therefore, the hydrocarbon chain association potential can be calculated as Eq. The key step of total potential energy calculation of mineral particle and oil drop interaction system was to determine the DDA adsorption density on the quartz and dodecane drop surface of the different systems. Among them, in the traditional oil agglomeration flotation process, DDA adsorption on quartz surface was measured by UV–Vis spectrometer with Eosin Y as indicator and its adsorption at the mineral interface was calculated by the Gibbs adsorption formula; moreover in the modification of oil agglomeration flotation processes, only the total adsorption at the mineral/water and oil/water interface was determined by UV–Vis spectrometer. The problem is how to identify the specific adsorption density on mineral/water and oil/water interface. It is well accepted that in the adsorption process, the equilibrium adsorption heat could reflect the adsorption intensity of the reagent and mineral in the collector adsorption process ( In this study, the molecular dynamics simulations were performed by using the Materials Studio 4.4 software package. Firstly, the MD simulation of the interaction between DDA and quartz was conducted. In order to devoid arbitrary boundary effects, the MD simulation of DDA and the quartz (001) plane was carried out in a simulation box with periodic boundary conditions to model a representative part of the interface. The built model was composed of collector layer, aqueous layer and mineral surface utilized the Amorphous Cell module, which cantained 2000 H As to the oil-DDA-water system, the dodecane, water and DDA molecules were filled into three individual boxes of same size of x,y-direction ( The MD simulation based on COMPASS force field was performed with the Velocity Verlet algorithm ( In order to compare the interaction intensity between an DDA molecule with quartz mineral surface or oil component, the interaction energy of single DDA molecule is calculated and presented in In order to investigate the interaction of the mineral and oil drop in the real flotation process, the total potential under the optimal experiment condition of the optimal weight ratio of DDA and dodecane (1:1) was discussed in this paper. The data used for the calculation of total potential of interaction between quartz particle and dodecane oil drop were listed in From The relationships between the interaction energy potentials of hydrophobic quartz particles induced by DDA and dodecane drop with the distance were represented in From The relationships between the interaction potentials of quartz particles and oil drop used premixed DDA and dodecane as collector were shown in Compared with the traditional oil agglomeration flotation process, through the comparisons of Based on the viewpoint of energetics aspect, the interfacial interactions between quartz particles and oil droplets have been investigated in this study. According to the EDLVO theory, the total interaction energy potential of quartz particle and dodecane drop was investigated through calculations of the van der Waals attractive interaction, electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic interaction and hydrocarbon chain association interaction potential. The calculation results demonstrated that the mineral particle and oil drop attachment state was mainly dominated by hydrophobic interaction potential. In the traditional oil agglomeration flotation process, when the distance between quartz particles and oil drops exceeded 60
