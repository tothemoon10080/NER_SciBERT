A slip boundary condition (SBC) has been known to occur at solid boundaries in a variety of materials processing including polymer processing. In the present work, implementation of the SBC has been tested for viscous and viscoelastic fluids obeying integral constitutive equations of the K-BKZ type. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to provide numerical results for tapered dies where sometimes slip is neglected in the reservoir and the converging entry section and applied only in the die. The present results show that this is valid for small values of a dimensionless slip coefficient B

                     >1, or the contraction angle or the contraction ratio is small; otherwise the pressure drops in the system are severely overpredicted. Viscoelasticity enhances those trends.Slip has been known to occur at solid boundaries for a variety of materials including polymers The works by Silliman and Scriven In polymer rheology and processing, slip has been found to occur under a wide range of conditions and it has been the subject of major research efforts, notably by Ramamurthy There have been arguments in the literature stating that slip is a local phenomenon occurring mostly near singularities, such as at the entrance corner in an abrupt contraction and at the exit of a die. Kamal et al. It is therefore the purpose of the present work to impose the slip boundary condition in viscous and viscoelastic flows with tapered boundaries and show the discrepancies when assuming that slip is only applied in the straight die. Furthermore, the formulation is given in some detail and results are produced for a certain viscoelastic melt (HDPE) for which experimental data is available We consider the conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy for weakly compressible fluids under non-isothermal, creeping (Reynolds number The viscous stresses are given for inelastic non-Newtonian compressible fluids by the relation A popular model for The viscosity may be dependent on temperature and pressure The pressure-dependence of viscosity can be taken into account by multiplying the constitutive relation with a pressure-shift factor, In the case of The K-BKZ model reduces to the integral Maxwell model with an appropriate choice of parameters, namely for one relaxation mode ( The above system of equations is closed once boundary conditions have been imposed on all boundaries (elliptic boundary-value problems at steady-state conditions) Along the Along the Along the Along the To make the variables dimensionless, we take as a characteristic velocity the outflow average velocity Viscoelasticity is usually assessed by the Weissenberg number, The pressure-dependence of the viscosity gives rise to the dimensionless pressure-shift parameter, Similarly, the compressibility coefficient The corresponding dimensionless slip parameter, The various thermal and flow parameters are combined to give appropriate dimensionless numbers The numerical solution of the above sets of governing equations and boundary conditions has been obtained with the Finite Element Method (FEM), using two different programs. The first (called The major features of the codes are as follows. The physical domain is discretized using quadrilateral elements. The velocity vector, the temperature, and the stream function are approximated by 9-node Lagrangian basis functions, For the governing conservation Eqs. In past works with purely viscous The two equations needed are Eqs. The no penetration condition, Eq. The The slip law (Eq. In long-hand notation we have: It should be noted that in the above we have for the components of the total stress The very first test was done for simple pressure-driven (Poiseuille) flow in a tube or between flat plates for a Newtonian fluid with both codes. We then tested the implementation of the SBC with the viscoelastic Maxwell fluid in Poiseuille flow in a tube for further code validation. The integral constitutive equation is written as It is not difficult to obtain the analytical solution for Poiseuille flow in the presence of linear slip for the above integral Maxwell fluid with a non-zero second normal-stress difference ( The results for  We continue our numerical tests for a Newtonian fluid flowing under pressure in a tapered circular die making an angle  Two runs have been made, at a low slip parameter ( The axial velocity profiles for The situation is more dramatic when considering the corresponding results for the pressures in We turn our attention to a flow of a polymer melt (HDPE with a polydispersity index 42 The axial velocity profiles along the centreline (c-line) and the die walls are shown in The axial pressure profiles along the centreline (c-line) and the die walls are shown in At this point, it is interesting to study the effects of contraction ratio We turn now our attention to the viscoelastic data for the HDPE polymer melt The axial velocity profiles along the centreline (c-line) and the die walls are shown in The axial pressure profiles along the centreline (c-line) and the die walls are shown in The slip boundary condition (SBC) has been implemented in cases of viscous and viscoelastic flows obeying an integral constitutive equation of the K-BKZ type. The details of implementation have been given in the general case of geometries where an arbitrary angle is present. It is shown that when the dimensionless slip parameter A test case of a polymer melt (HDPE) exhibiting slip was studied, seen either as a viscous (Cross) fluid or a viscoelastic (K-BKZ) fluid.

Our recent work Combining the discrete forms of the conservation equations of mass and momentum (including compressibility) into one matrix equation leads (in two-dimensional axisymmetric domains, The entries for each term in the above system are given in detail in With the SBC, the extra terms along the slip boundary are: After the appropriate manipulations, the following matrix system is obtained from the slip contribution: The above contributions of [ For the integral constitutive equation (Eq.
