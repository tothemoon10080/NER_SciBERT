Lipolysis and lipid oxidation in Mediterranean and North Europe type sausages were studied in relation to raw material, processing conditions and additives. In particular the effect of ascorbic acid, nitrites and spices was evaluated. Lipolysis was measured by the determination of total and free fatty acids of fresh minces and matured products and lipid oxidation was evaluated by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and cholesterol oxidation products. The increase of free fatty acids during maturation appears to be independent from processing conditions and the differences in polyunsaturated fatty acids increment found among the formulations appear to be due to inherent variations of raw materials. The presence of ascorbic acid and/or nitrite seems important for cholesterol protection and, as a consequence, for the safety of fermented meat products while spices at doses up to 0.1% do not seem to have a remarkable effect. The effect on fatty acid oxidation of the same additives and of the different processing technologies is not significantly different and the variations linked to raw material may play the greatest role.Lipids in dry cured meat products are hydrolysed by lipases with production of free fatty acids ( Fermented meat products are rich in lipids and, in the case of Milano sausages for instance, a significant percentage of them is made up by monounsaturated (about 45%) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (about 13%) ( Oxidative stress is, indeed, considered to be responsible for a variety of very damaging chronic degenerative diseases to the point that the knowledge of the interactions between oxidants and antioxidants in human health has been defined as important as the discovery of the role of antibiotics and microrganisms in infectious disease ( Production technology of dry fermented sausages makes use of substances with pro-oxidant and anti-oxidant activity. Sodium chloride, the prime added compound, has prooxidant effects and nitrates/nitrites are involved in oxidation-reduction reactions in meat products as clearly exemplified by the chemical pathways known to lead to the formation of nitrosylmyoglobin in cured products ( The aim of the research that has been carried out was to investigate the possible relationship between lipolysis, oxidation and antioxidant additives in the production of typical dry cured fermented sausages of different European origin. European fermented meat products can be roughly classified as Mediterranean, or Southern Europe type, generally characterised by long maturing times, slow pH fall, pH of matured products higher than 5, flavour significantly affected by the use of spices, and Northern Europe type, characterised by fast pH fall, final pH lower than 5, smoking and shorter maturing times. The investigation was based on two southern and two northern type fermented meat products: one southern (M1) produced by an industrial firm located in a south European country, a second southern sausage (M2) from a producer of north Europe who also produced a northern type product (N1) and a second northern type sausage (N2) from a third firm of north Europe. The results described were obtained within the framework of a European project ( The first part of the research was directed at comparing four types of fermented sausages produced according to standard formulations whereas in the second part of the work the formulation of one of the southern type sausages was modified to study the role played by spices, nitrates/nitrites and ascorbate. Five batches of each type have been produced for the first phase with the following formulations. Fresh pork shoulders (72%) and pork streaky bacon (28%) were minced to 3.5 mm particle size and mixed with salt (2.5%), skimmed milk (2.8%), NaNO Fresh (33%) and frozen (33%) lean pork cuts and pork back fat (33%) were minced to 2.5 mm particle size and mixed with salt (3%), caseinate (1.15%), NaNO Frozen lean beef (33%), fresh pork (33%) and pork back fat (33%) were minced to 2.5 mm particle size and mixed with salt (3%), caseinate (1.15%), NaNO Frozen and fresh beef (30%), frozen pork (40%) and pork back fat (30%) were minced to 2.0 mm particle size and mixed with salt (4%), NaNO Two batches of three different formulations were produced for the second part of the study using the M1 type as control. The formulation of M1 was modified in one case ( Proximate composition, NaCl, pH, non protein nitrogen, residual nitrites and nitrates, fatty acid composition ( Sausages belonging to the M1 formulation had average moisture contents ranging from 38 to 39% approximately, fat from 31 to 33%, protein from 23.6 to 24.2%, NaCl from 4 to 4.3% and NPN from 13.7 to 14.5% ( Compositional data, besides confirming the known pH difference between south and north European sausages, have shown some technologically significant divergences in fat, protein and NaCl contents. The above mentioned differences, though, did not seem to have significant effects on gross proteolysis, as evaluated by the measurement of non protein nitrogen (nitrogen containing fractions that are not precipitated by 10% trichloracetic acid) that remained constant on values around 13–14% irrespective of the technology adopted (raw materials, mincing level, starter cultures, additives, processing times and conditions). The overall result is in line with the general conclusion that proteolysis, down to free amino acids is mainly the result of muscle enzymes and not much influenced by starter cultures, as also concluded from studies using an aseptic meat model system ( Total fatty acid composition in minces is collected in The distribution of free fatty acids (FFA) did not follow the same pattern just reported for total fatty acids ( Maturation brought about a widespread increase in FFA that went from less or a little more than 1% of total fatty acids in the minces to a minimum of 2.17% in M2 and a maximum of 4.52% in M1 ( The amount of free fatty acid was between 7 and 10 mg/g fat in minces and between 25 and 32 mg/g fat in matured products ( Free fatty acid content of formulations M1–F1, M1–F2 and M1–F3 followed the lead of M1, as for other parameters, with the only divergence of M1–F3 in which the nearly 13 mg/g fat of free fatty acids observed in the mince, the highest among the seven formulations, determined a significant lower ratio between free fatty acids in matured products and minces: the value was 2.3 in M1–F3 and around 3 for the other formulations ( The observed changes in FFA are in line with results reported by other investigators. The specific liberation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and of monounsaturated ones to a lower extent, had been reported by   As for the role played by additives and technological conditions, Finally, differences in lipolytic activity could also derive from the presence of surface moulds (in fermented products of south of Europe). The combined analysis of the results obtained with the seven formulations produced in the present study, and of the data available in the literature, confirms that lipolysis in dry fermented meat products is mainly due to endogenous lipases and is largely independent of processing conditions. Indeed, differences in raw materials (pork, beef, type of fat, fresh or frozen raw materials), additives, spices, degree of comminution, size of sausages, starter cultures, pH, processing temperatures and length of maturing do not appear to be related to variations observed in free fatty acids from the minces to matured products. The differences found among the various formulations appear to be more probably due to inherent variations of the lean and fat tissues used. It has been reported, for instance, that slaughter conditions could influence the degree of the glycerides hydrolysis due to activation of the triglyceride lipase by adrenalin released ( A further element that should be kept in mind is the decrease during the final stages of maturation of some free unsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic acid, reported by other researchers ( Cholesterol oxidation in matured sausages, as shown by the three oxides observed in all samples, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, 5,6α-epoxycholesterol and 7keto-cholesterol, was low, varying from a minimum of 0.08% to a maximum of 0.2%. Values lower than 0.1% of oxidised cholesterol were observed in M1, N2, M1–F1 and M1–F2 whereas M2 and N1 were slightly higher than 0.1% and M1–F3 was on an average of 0.2% ( The data just reported agree with previous measurements of cholesterol oxidation and TBARS in a typical Italian dry fermented meat product ( A concentration of oxysterols around 0.1% is approximately the minimum level for toxicity to be observed in “in vitro” experiments on cultured cells but about 100 times lower than the level required to show toxic effects in “in vivo” trials with laboratory animals ( Antioxidant properties of garlic and paprika in dry fermented sausages have been reported ( The different formulations used to produce fermented sausages representative of the main types existing in Europe have provided data which support the hypothesis that most of the proteolysis and lipolysis taking place during maturation is of endogenous origin. Technology appears to affect proteolysis indirectly: differences in rate of pH decline and final pH may affect endogenous proteolytic enzymes. Other technological parameters, such as starter cultures, additives and spices do not seem to have perceivable effects on lipolysis and lipid oxidation. No significant differences have been observed in lipid oxidation among different formulations with the only exception of the formulation lacking nitrites/nitrates and ascorbic acid. Such a result stresses the need for some antioxidant compounds in the formulation not only for colour stability purposes but also for lipid protection and, therefore, for the safety of matured products.
