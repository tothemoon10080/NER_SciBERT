The dairy sector in India, being the largest milk producer in the world, consumes substantial amounts of water annually. This industry is, therefore, likely to affect water sustainability in India in the near future. Amul Dairy, is the largest food brand in India and as such consumes large amounts of water annually. The cleaning-in-place (CIP) processes at Amul Diary accounts for nearly 75% of the total water consumption. The raw milk receiving and processing department (RMRD) requires nearly 90% of the total water used in CIP. This work, therefore, investigates the water usage in Amul Dairy and identifies the prospects of water reuse by using optimization techniques for minimizing water usage in the RMRD. This was achieved by treating the wastewater from the RMRD plant by means of a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane in order to allow opportunities for regeneration–reuse/recycling in the CIP process. An overall mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) framework was developed that simultaneously evaluates both water recycle/reuse and regeneration reuse/recycle opportunities. The model applied to the CIP process in the RMRD plant resulted in 33% reduction of freshwater consumption and 85% reduction of wastewater generation.={ ={ ={ ={ Annual operating time, h Water permeability coefficient, m/(s Freshwater cost, $/t Wastewater treatment cost, $/t Cost coefficient for pumps, $/(yearW0.65) Cost coefficient for turbines, $/(yearW0.43) Cost parameter for chemicals, $/kg Cost per module of HFRO membrane, $/(year Cost of electricity, $/kWh Maximum allowable concentration into the sink, mg/L Maximum allowable concentration into the regenerator, mg/L Manhattan distance between source, Manhattan distance between regenerator, Manhattan distance between regenerator, Manhattan distance between source, Maximum flowrate per HFRO module, kg/s Minimum flowrate per HFRO module, kg/s Solute permeability coefficient, m/s Liquid recovery Fibre length, m Seal length, m Interest per year Number of years Efficiency of pump Efficiency of turbine Number of RO modules Number of hollow fibre RO modules Osmotic Constant, Pa Power consumed by the pump, kg Power consumed by energy recovery turbines, kg Shell side pressure drop per module per regenerator, Pa Permeate pressure per regenerator, Pa Flow pressure in feed side of the regenerator, Pa Flow pressure in retentate side of regenerator, Pa Atmospheric pressure, Pa Outside radius of fibre, m Inner radius of fibre, m Removal ratio Membrane area per module, m Total Annual Cost, $/year Velocity, m/s Dimensionless constant Pressure drop across regenerator Concentration of contaminant, Concentration of contaminant, Concentration of the contaminant, Concentration of contaminant, Average contaminant concentration on the feed side, mg/L Freshwater flowrate, kg/s Flowrate of source, Flowrate of sink, Flowrate between source, Flowrate between source and regenerator, Feed flowrate into regenerator, Permeate flowrate out of regenerator, Retentate flowrate out of regenerator, Permeate flowrate between regenerator and sink, Retentate flowrate between regenerator and sink, Wastewater flowrate, kg/s Osmotic pressure, Pa     The process and manufacturing industry consumes substantial amounts of water and also generates considerable amounts of wastewater. The waste load comprises mainly some products which are lost during the processing operations. Sustainable water and wastewater management through improved operation and proper management practices may effectively reduce the freshwater consumption and wastewater generated in industry ( The dairy sector in India, being the largest in the world, consumes approximately 62 billion Water optimization is one of the prevailing methodologies being proposed in literature to minimize water usage as it can be utilized to reduce freshwater consumption and wastewater generation through water reuse, recycle and regeneration–reuse/recycle ( Two methods can be used in water minimization, namely insight based techniques and mathematical optimization methods. Insight-based techniques use a unified framework to match individual water demand with suitable supplies, depending on the quantity required and the quality offered. Minimum water targets are determined and alternative water network structures are derived, from which the best is selected ( In this work, mathematical optimization approach is used as it allows the processing of complex systems with multiple contaminants and has the capacity to successfully integrate the water network (WN) model with the regeneration model. Mathematical optimization usually employs a superstructure which forms the basis of the mathematical model formulation that is ultimately solved to optimality. This optimization approach allows the designer to identify an optimal configuration for the process from a number of alternatives ( In water network optimization, usually a superstructure is employed to identify the optimal configuration for the process from numerous available alternatives. The current approach uses the detailed nonlinear RO model developed by Amul is the largest food brand of India majoring in production of milk and milk products. It is run by collection of milk from 700 thousand villagers. This dairy processes 1800 The collected milk is first filtered to remove unwanted solids. As shown in Sometimes a small amount of the same pasteurized milk is homogenized and transported to flavoured milk manufacturing section. Homogenization is the process of breaking down the fat globules in milk so that they remain integrated rather than separated as cream ( The quality of water leaving the various process units is analysed on the basis of mainly two contaminants—Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS). Many organic substances, which are difficult to oxidize biologically by aerobic microbes, or are toxic to micro-organisms, such as lignin, can be oxidized chemically by using strong oxidizing agents like dichromate (Cr Solids in wastewater consist of organic and inorganic particles and they can either be ‘suspended’ or ‘dissolved’. Total Suspended Solids is the dry-weight of particles trapped by a filter. In wastewater of medium strength, about 75% of the suspended solids and 40% of the filterable solids are organic in nature. They provide adsorption sites for chemical and biological contaminants. As suspended solids degrade biologically, they can create toxic by-products. Suspended solids in wastewater directly affect the turbidity. TSS is measured in ppm or mg/L ( A fixed flowrate model that considers the concept of sources and sinks is adopted in this work. A water source is a unit that produces water and a water sink is a unit that requires water. The model takes into account streams with multiple contaminants. The problem addressed in this work, in general, can be stated as follows: Given: A set of water sources, A set of water sinks, A set of regenerators, A freshwater source A wastewater sink, To be determined: The minimum freshwater intake, wastewater generation and the total annualized cost (TAC). The optimal configuration of the WN. The optimal operation and design conditions of the RO membrane such as feed pressure, number of hollow fibre modules per regenerator, stream distributions, separation levels etc. The mathematical model entails the following constraints that are based on the superstructure depicted in In a similar way, constraint The water balance around the regenerator as shown in The performance of the regenerator is based on the removal ratio, The liquid recovery is another performance indicator of the regenerator which is defined by constraint Detailed design equations for the RO regenerator are also included in the model. This includes the osmotic pressure, Δ The permeate contaminant concentration is a function of the pressure drop and the osmotic pressure. This is given in constraint The permeate flow rate per module is determined based on constraint Additionally, to forbid remixing of the regenerator product streams, some logical constraints are also introduced. One such constraint that prevents the mixing of permeate and retentate streams in the same sink and this is shown in constraint To ensure that only practical flow rates are accommodated by the piping, appropriate bounds are allocated to all the flow rates such that any stream with a flow rate outside these limits is not allowed to exist. This is achieved by means of the big-M constraint adopted by The objective is set to simultaneously minimize the freshwater consumption, the wastewater generation as well as the capital and operating cost of the piping on an annualized basis. The TAC of the RO membrane consists of the capital cost of hollow fibre RO modules, energy recovery turbines and pumps; pre-treatment of chemicals; as well as the operating cost of pumps and turbines. The TAC also considers the operating revenue of the energy recovery turbines and is shown in constraint where The piping cost of components was calculated by assuming a linear fixed-charge model. In this formulation, the cost of a pipe is incurred if the flowrate through the pipe falls below the threshold value. This is achieved by using 0–1 variables. It was assumed within the model that, all the pipes share the same properties of The objective function of the water network is shown in Eq.           Rest of the symbols have similar meanings which are given under the Nomenclature Section. The overall model results in a non convex MINLP due to the nonlinear terms as well as the integer variables in the constraints. In this contribution, three scenarios are considered to demonstrate the impact of an integrated framework in fresh and wastewater minimization. Base scenario: normal operation of the plant Scenario 1: water integration without regeneration Scenario 2: water integration with regeneration The base scenario refers to an informed estimate of the freshwater consumption and wastewater generation of a plant under its normal operation, without full exploration of reuse and recycles opportunities. To improve its efficiency with respect to minimizing freshwater intake and wastewater generation, two more scenarios are proposed which are discussed along with the base scenario in the following sub sections. The base scenario describes the normal operation of the Amul plant. To understand this, we have to first understand the CIP mechanism deployed here for efficient cleaning of the equipment. CIP is mostly a three stage process, as described below. Freshwater is circulated for 10–15 Hot lye solution, which is essentially NaOH solution, followed by clean water from reverse osmosis (RO) membrane, are then circulated for about 10 more minutes to rinse the equipment. The lye solution prevents microbial growth. The water leaving this stage is sent for quality check where its conductivity levels are monitored. High conductivity means it is rich in negatively charged ions (OH The clean RO water which is circulated just after the alkaline solution is used to clean up the tanks and wash away traces of the lye solution. In some cases, some acid, preferably nitric acid, is also circulated for 5 To ensure cleaning-in-place, water from freshwater supply line is brought to the RMRD of the plant where the equipments are cleaned. CIP is a batch operation. Some equipments may require cleaning twice daily, some after every 10 Similar to the base scenario, here also water is reused for further cleaning with only difference being that the water network is made a lot more complicated by incorporating interconnections between the various process units. If there are Here along with the huge amount of interconnections between the different units, there is also a RO regeneration unit which is used to regenerate a portion of the contaminated water. Water is purified by reverse osmosis and recycled back to the process units for further cleaning of the equipment. There are specific conditions for the different contaminants generated in each equipment which determine whether the water is to be sent to the regeneration unit for recycling or not. Of all the three scenarios, Scenario 2 gives the best result since implementation of regeneration along with water integration minimizes the freshwater intake significantly, which ultimately reduces the wastewater generation. A model based on the work by At first an informed estimate of freshwater consumption and wastewater generation on the current RMRD plant is reported followed by the implementation of the proposed Scenarios 1 and 2. The results obtained from the three scenarios are shown in Under normal operation of the plant, freshwater used for cleaning a particular equipment after a single pass goes directly to the treatment plant. There is no integration of the process units (connections among units) and hence the extent of reuse is negligible. Thus it increases the freshwater requirement for cleaning which in turn increases the amount of wastewater generated. As shown in In contrast to the base scenario where the extent of reuse is limited, in Scenario 1 the water network contains interconnections between the various process units. For instance, water from the separator (less contaminated) unit can be used to clean the pasteurisation unit (more contaminated) for the first time. As seen in In Scenario 2, along with the interconnections among process units, an RO regenerator is also added to the water network in this scenario to regenerate a portion of the contaminated water. Thus water is purified and recycled back to the process units for further cleaning of the equipment. This further reduces the freshwater intake which in turn minimizes the amount of wastewater generated. In this work, DuPont B-10 hollow fibre RO modules (described in As shown in This work addresses water reuse/recycle opportunities in a large scale milk processing plant through process integration based on comprehensive superstructure optimization. A comprehensive regenerator model embedded within a WN model was used. The model was applied to both a literature example and a case study from Amul Dairy and was solved using GAMS/BARON in order to highlight its applicability. The results show that water integration coupled with a regeneration system, can lead to a reduction in the total cost (up to 33%) of the network, due to the significant reduction in freshwater consumption and wastewater generation. This shows that optimization of water networks is a powerful and sustainable water management tool that can be valuable to the dairy industry. The framework presented in this study for dairy industries can be extended in a number of significant ways. The current work considers only a time-average model in order to suppress the time dimension that is inherent in batch plants. The proposed framework can be extended to include time in the analysis. This article considers only on optimizing the CIP operations in RMRD section of the Amul plant. Though the CIP in this section is automated, our work has shown that optimization of the water network could help achieve significant cost reduction. The CIP operations in the other sections of the plant (milk recovery units) are not automated and offer a huge potential for optimization of water networks. The current work focuses only on optimization of water networks and can be easily extended to optimize for energy consumption in various dairy units.
