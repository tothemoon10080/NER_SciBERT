In this work, the applicability of the two most commonly used equations for calculating the fracture toughness by nanoindentation is discussed in terms of indenter geometry and indentation crack morphology. These equations are calibrated for Berkovich and cube-corner indenters taking into account the actual indentation crack morphology, in order to attain a more reliable estimation of fracture toughness in small material volumes by nanoindentation. The symbols Mechanical characterization of small volumes, such as thin films or micro-sized phases, has recently received much attention, and many works have focused on the determination of Sharper indenters than Berkovich or Vickers indenters, such as the cube-corner indenter, displace a much larger volume of material for a given load. Therefore, higher stresses are induced beneath the indenter, and thus cracks can be generated at lower loads Accurate The materials used in this work have well-known and accepted values of Berkovich and cube-corner indenters were used in a XP Nanoindenter (MTS Corp.) with applied loads in the range of 200 The indented materials showed a well-defined crack pattern in the range of applied loads. Only indentations showing well-developed cracks and without chipping were used to calculate The values of The obtained calibration for cube-corner indenters differs from that obtained in previous works Concerning the range of applicability of the proposed values for The experimental calibration of In summary, examination of the crack morphology shows that indentation cracks are radial with a semi-elliptical shape when Berkovich and cube-corner indenters are used in nanoindentation. Therefore, from a phenomenological point of view Laugierâ€™s equation would be more suitable for evaluating
