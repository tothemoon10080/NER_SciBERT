The experiments of It has been noted by In calculations involving liquid drainage in foam, one often needs to relate the cross-sectional area of a Plateau border, There has been a model for liquid recovery published since Zheng et al. work. The model has been verified with data for de-mineralised foam. However, if the drainage parameters,
