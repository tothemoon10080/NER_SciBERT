Lactide-co-δ-valerolactone copolymers (PLVL) have not attracted as much research interest as the more popular poly(lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) (PLCL) elastomeric materials. In this work the study of the mechanical performance is focused on the former with the aim of identifying the potential advantages of these thermoplastic elastomers for their application in the biomedical field. Mechanical testing (at 21°C and at 37°C) of at least 5 specimens and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) in duplicate were carried out on various PLVL, which include a moderately blocky l-lactide/δ-valerolactone copolymer (~70% of l-LA and R=0.68) and several that showed a random distribution of sequences (R~1): some terpolymers based on l-lactide, d-lactide and δ-valerolactone (with a lactone content of ~25 and ~14%) and a series of copolymers of l-LA and δ-VL having l-LA molar contents ranging from 69 to 74%. In view of the results, it can be concluded that noteworthy improvements in stiffness and strength were achieved by adding δ-VL to the reaction mix instead of ε-CL, although both monomers have analogous chemical properties. For example, a PLVL with a 75:25M composition of l-LA/δ-VL at 21°C presented a secant modulus of 213.7±36.5MPa and σ

                     =14.7±1.4MPa whereas a previously studied PLCL of equal composition had a secant modulus and an ultimate stress value of 19.4±1.3MPa and 3.2±0.6MPa, respectively. At 37°C, the differences in the mechanical properties between the different PLVLs of this work were far less relevant, with most of them showing a fully elastomeric behavior. Referring to the DMA measurements, the reduction in the peak of tan δ (from ~2.5 to 0.5) through the glass transition was a clear indicator that crystalline domains formed during hydrolytic degradation in some of the polymers. However, the more amorphous PLVLs with short l-LA average sequence lengths (l
                     
                        l-LA<2.91) did not undergo changes in the storage modulus and tan δ curves after two weeks submerged in PBS at 37°C.Attaining a combination of strength and elasticity has been a particular challenge for researchers working on synthetic biodegradable polyesters. Copolymerization with a complementing monomer is the strategy typically employed to tailor the mechanical, thermal and biodegradation properties of a final polymer, thereby allowing the enhancement of the ductility of polylactides and polyglycolides. ε-Caprolactone (ε-CL) and β-butyrolactone (β-BL) are two of the best-known cyclic esters and have been widely employed by many researchers in the past in numerous polymerization routes with lactide or glycolide ( In the search for new biomaterials, several other lactones have attracted the interest of researchers. These cyclic esters (see δ-Valerolactone does not approach the industrial importance of ε-caprolactone and has attracted less attention than the latter, above all because of their similar chemical properties (δ-VL has an identical structure to ε-CL but has four straight methylenes instead of five).

Both polymers undergo an appreciable drop in the stress after the yield point but then the stress value fluctuates within a very narrow range while the specimens of these polymers continue to deform until they fail.

However, major differences were found when comparing the mechanical properties at room temperature (21±2 The changes in the mechanical behaviour between the different PLVLs were much lower at human body temperature (37 Dynamic mechanical measurements were carried out on non-degraded samples and on samples which were degraded for 14 days in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (pH 7.2) at 37 The authors are thankful for funds from the
