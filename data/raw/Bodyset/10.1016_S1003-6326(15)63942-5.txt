2,3-disulfanylbutanedioic acid (DMSA) was found to be a selective depressant in the flotation separation of copperâ€“ molybdenum sulfides. The flotation results suggest that a low dosage of DMSA has a strong depression effect on chalcopyrite in the pH range between 4 and 12. At pH 6, the recoveries of molybdenum are up to 85%, 75%, and 80% while those of chalcopyrite are 15%, 5%, and 20% respectively when flotation tests are carried out with single minerals, mixed minerals and molybdenum-bearing copper concentrates. Adsorption isotherms measurement indicates that DMSA adsorbs more strongly on chalcopyrite than on molybdenite. The frontier orbital calculation reveals that the two S atoms of DMSA molecule are active centers for the adsorption of the DMSA molecule on chalcopyrite surface. Fermi level calculation shows that chalcopyrite can obtain electrons from the DMSA molecule while molybdenite cannot.
