The adsorption isotherm of sodium polyacrylate on dicalcium silicate (2CaO·SiO2) in sodium aluminate solution at 80 °C was studied. The type of surface adsorption of sodium polyacrylate is saturated adsorption, and the adsorption behavior belongs to L-type, according with the monolayer adsorption model of Langmuir equation. The surface coverage of sodium polyacrylate is 1.06 mol/μm2. The relation curve between the surface pressure and the molecular area of adsorption film was obtained by Gibbs formula. The variation of interfacial energy caused by adsorption as well as the relationship between the relation curve and the type of adsorption was discussed.
