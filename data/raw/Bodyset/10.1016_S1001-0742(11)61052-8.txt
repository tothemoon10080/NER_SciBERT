Trimercaptotriazine-functionalized polystyrene chelating resin was prepared and employed for the adsorption of Ag(I) from aqueous solution. The adsorbent was characterized according to the following techniques: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy and the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller method. The effects of initial Ag(I) concentration, contact time, solution pH and coexisting ions on the adsorption capacity of Ag(I) were systematically investigated. The maximum adsorption capacity of Ag(I) was up to 187.1 mg/g resin at pH 0.0 and room temperature. The kinetic experiments indicated that the adsorption rate of Ag(I) onto the chelating resin was quite fast in the first 60 min and reached adsorption equilibrium after 360 min. The adsorption process can be well described by the pseudo second-order kinetic model and the equilibrium adsorption isotherm was closely fitted by the Langmuir model. Moreover, the chelating resin could selectively adsorb more Ag(I) ions than other heavy metal ions including: Cu(II), Zn(II), Ni(II), Pb(II) and Cr(III) during competitive adsorption in the binary metal species systems, which indicated that it was a highly selective adsorbent of Ag(I) from aqueous solution.
