The effectiveness of alkali, acid and chlorite pretreatment of lignocellulosic feedstocks for improving the enzymatic saccharification of cellulose has been evaluated. The feedstocks such as Corncob, Prosopis juliflora and Lantana camara were pretreated with varied concentration of sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide and sodium chlorite at 121°C for 15–60min. Among different methods used, chlorite pretreatment removed maximum lignin with ∼90% (w/w) residual holocellulose content in all the substrates tested. Moreover, irrespective of the substrates used, the chlorite treated substrates were enzymatically saccharified from 86.4% to 92.5% (w/w). While, the alkali treated substrates containing 66.0–76.0% (w/w) holocellulose could be enzymatically saccharified up to 55% (w/w). The acid pretreated substrates were found to contain almost 54–62% (w/w) holocellulose, which on enzymatic hydrolysis could result in 39.5–48% (w/w) saccharification.Lignocellulosics, the most abundant biomass available on earth, have attracted considerable attention as an alternative feedstock for the production of various value added products due to their renewable nature and low cost availability ( The thermo-chemical pretreatment strategies such as acid, alkali and oxidation are commonly used for lignocellulosic biomass. The dilute mineral acids have been reported to remove the hemicellulosic fraction from substrates to improve enzymatic saccharification of cellulose ( Since there is no universal and economically viable pretreatment method available, which could be used to pretreat varied cellulosic biomass, in the present study, it has been attempted to evaluate the suitably used three pretreatment methods (acid, alkali and chlorite treatment) for lignocellulosic feedstocks viz., The lignocellulosic substrates: Corncob (CC), The dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment of lignocellulosic substrate (100.0 The substrate (100.0 The lignocellulosic substrate (100.0 Cellulase from Enzymatic hydrolysis of each type of pretreated plant materials (10.0 The chemical composition (α-cellulose, klason lignin, pentosans, moisture and ash) of all the three substrates and their residual solid fraction post pretreatment were determined following standard The percent loss and gain of different components in pretreated substrates were calculated using following equations: All the experiments were performed in triplicate and the results are presented as mean The chemical composition analysis of different lignocellulosic biomass revealed that the holocellulose content was in the range of 61.1–71.6% (w/w), where The dilute acid treatment is the most commonly used method to pretreat the lignocellulosic biomass to hydrolyse hemicellulosic fraction of lignocellulosic substrates, which is a critical parameter for process efficacy ( During the alkali pretreatment, an increase in alkali concentration up to 5.0% (w/v) caused a regular increase in removal of lignin and in turn holocellulose gain in PJ and LC, while a 4.0% (w/v) alkali concentration was found to be optimum for CC ( All the three substrates when pretreated with 4% (w/v) sodium chlorite for 30 The enzymatic saccharification of all the three pretreated substrates showed an improved conversion of cellulose to glucose because of lignin and/or hemicellulose removal during pretreatments. The acid pretreated samples with minimum lignin removal showed lowest enzymatic hydrolysis (39.5–48.0% (w/w)), while, the alkali and sodium chlorite pretreated substrates caused higher enzymatic saccharification, which could be because of comparatively lower lignin content in the pretreated substrates ( Among different pretreated substrates evaluated here for the enzymatic hydrolysis, the chlorite pretreated substrates were observed to be more vulnerable to the enzymatic hydrolysis and resulted in maximum saccharification efficiency i.e., from 86.4% to 92.5% (w/w) ( Among different chemical pretreatments studied, the sodium chlorite pretreatment was found to be the most effective in lignin removal and led to the enrichment of the holocellulose content in treated substrates. This method offers the possibility of producing cellulosic material largely free from lignin, which eventually would be a good substrate for bioethanol production. However, there is a need to develop efficient biological delignification methods to make the process environmentally safe. The authors are grateful to Department of Biotechnology,
