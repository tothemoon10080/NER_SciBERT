This paper proposes an analytical model to calculate the evolution of the grain size distribution due to crushing of granular materials under cyclic loading. The model, that requires very low computational cost, combines a theory for polydisperse mixtures with Markovian processes. The evaluation of the performance of the model was carried out experimentally using a gyratory compactor. The comparison of the results obtained experimentally with those obtained using the proposed model shows very good agreement. As a result, the analytical model proposed here is a useful alternative to be included in a model based in continuum mechanics.decompaction coefficient for the linear packing model size coefficient for the Weibull function slope of the Wohler fatigue line wall effect coefficient for the linear packing model coefficient of uniformity of the grain size distribution size of particles void ratio filling coefficient complement of the filling coefficient contact force between particles packing coefficient coefficient for the probability distribution function of contact loads packing coefficient of grains coefficient of the Weibull function porosity number of classes in the grain size distribution number of loading cycles transition probability for the Markov transition matrix failure probability of grains survival probability of grains volumetric proportion of grains coefficient for the probability distribution function of contact loads coefficient of the Beta function representing the distribution of crushed grains exponent of the function affecting crushing depending on the compacity of the mixture coefficient for the probability distribution function of contact loads residual compacity: maximum compacity obtained experimentally for the fraction coefficient of the Beta function representing the distribution of crushed grains proportion of floating particles in the mixture compacity: volume of grains by unit volume partial volume of the class maximum partial volume of grains filling coefficient for maximum comminution virtual compacity: theoretical maximum compacity of the granular mixture without any alteration of the particle’s shape virtual compacity considering grains characteristic strength macroscopic strength mean stress between particles normalized mean stress between particles normalized contact load between particles Particle fracture due to cyclic loading taking place in transportation works such as roads, railroads, or embankments affect the most important engineering properties of granular materials and, therefore, affect the long term performance of these works. Assessing the evolution of the grain size distribution of unbound granular materials is extremely complex because particle breakage involves several characteristics of the mixture such as grain angularity, grain size distribution, particle strength, porosity, stress level, anisotropy, and water content Researches carried out in the past 15 The comparison of the results obtained experimentally with those obtained using the proposed model shows very good agreement. For this reason, the analytical model proposed here could be a useful alternative to be included in models based in continuum mechanics. The paper is divided in two parts: part 1 includes the theoretical background of the model, its relevance to describe granular compaction and the experimental validation of the model input parameters and of granular compaction results; part 2 describes the model for comminution of granular materials under cyclic loading including the theoretical model development and its validation. The description of the evolution of the grain size distribution of a granular material requires a model providing some characteristics of a continuum material from a mixture of grains of different size. Models dealing with binary mixtures of clay and granular particles have been proposed by several authors The linear packing density model allows calculating the compacity of polydisperse granular mixtures The compacity, For binary mixtures with grain sizes No interaction: in this case one of the grain class is substantially bigger than the other, Total interaction occurs when the size of the particles in the binary mixture is identical, but the residual compacity is different: Partial interaction occurs in the case of binary mixtures with The virtual compacity For the binary mixture, only the minimum between A mixture with total interaction is defined as a mixture having particles of the same size, This equation allows obtaining one of the partial volume In the case of partial interaction two effects appear: (i) decompaction effect occurs when the voids between the big grains don’t have enough volume to admit small grains, in that case the only possibility to arrange the small grains without alteration of their original shape is separating the bigger grains, reducing the compacity of the whole mixture as shown in The decompaction effect and the wall effect on the virtual compacity are analysed in Decompaction and wall coefficients were calibrated experimentally for different combinations of shape and size of particles, leading to the following expressions In the case of a polydisperse mixture, with As the impenetrability restriction is still applicable, the dominant size of grains corresponds to the class that leads to the minimum value of the virtual compacity: The virtual compacity For a real mixture, the actual compacity of the mixture is obtained by summation of the partial volumes of each grain size, In the same way, the packing coefficient   The linear packing model presented above was used extensively to find out the best gradation of granular mixtures for concrete proportioning. Although the usage of this model in geotechnical engineering was limited, it could be a powerful model to describe granular materials. In fact, using this model it is possible to study the effect of variables such as the shape of the particles, the grain size distribution, the level of compaction, on the state of each granular class within the mixture. This last point provides information that allows linking micro and macro mechanics, as it is shown below. The effect of the shape of the particles is captured in the LP Model by the residual compacity The LPM is also useful to assess the compressibility of a granular material because this models permits to calculate the void ratio of the mixture depending on the packing coefficient The state of each grain size within the granular mixture can be assessed calculating the filling coefficient Calculation of particle breakage on granular mixtures requires the knowledge of the contact loads between particles. These loads have been calculated by several authors using discrete element models Results reported in  Potential relationships presented in  Considering the relationships presented in Although The quantity of floating particles within the granular material is another important issue that affect comminution of granular materials. Results presented in The complement of the filling coefficient, By similarity with segregation, the proportion of grains in a loose state can be calculated using the LP Model by summation of the complement of the filling coefficient of grains below the dominant grain size as follows: Results inferred using Eq. The model presented in this paper consider four elements to calculate comminution of granular materials under cyclic loading: (i) the distribution of loads and stresses between particles depending on the grain size distribution, (ii) the strength of the particles considering its size and the reduction of the strength as a result of the cyclic loading, and (iii) the grain size distribution of crushed particles. Results of particle’s strength reported in Regarding cyclic loading, the strength of particles decrease as a result of the effect of fatigue, Wohler law permit to assess the reduction of strength of brittle materials when submitted to cyclic loading as follows: Including the Wohler fatigue law in the Weibull probability function leads to the following equation: The probability distribution function of contact forces between particles has been studied extensively using DEM, and the following expression was proposed in Considering the distribution of stresses on the probability of crushing, given by the Weibull relationship, the probability of crushing depending on stresses results in the following equation: Obtaining the distribution function of tensile stresses within particles from the distribution of contact loads is only valid for a low coordination number. This problem can be solved using the filling coefficient. In fact, as it was shown in Section Regarding stresses, a relationship Regarding crushing, the relationship Eq. Parameter The crushing probability depends on the compacity of the mixture, related with the filling coefficient of each granulometric fraction, and on the strength of the particles. Considering these two factors as independent processes; the combined probability of crushing can be assessed through the following equation: When a granular particle breaks, it produces a set of smaller sub-particles modifying the grain size distribution of the mixture, this progression can be described by Markov processes. In such type of processes an initial particle having In a Markovian process, the transition between states is described by the transition probability In this matrix, components Finally, the evolution of the grain size distribution of a granular mixture results from the product of the transition probability matrix (transposed) and the original grain size distribution: Different qualities of unbound granular materials from the “Sabana de Bogotá” in Colombia were selected for this study. These materials are gravels made of sandstones from tertiary formations of the east subdivision of the Andes cordillera in Colombia. The sandstones for the three selected gravels have different degrees of cementation, that affects their abrasion resistance or crushability, which is usually characterized by the Los Angeles abrasion coefficient (LA). The model proposed in this paper requires characterizing the following properties for each material: the residual compacity, Two methods have been proposed to measure the residual compacity of each fraction A vibration method placing a mass of 7 The second method is similar than the first one, but the compaction energy is applied by chocks: 20 chocks from a height of 10 For both methods the compacity is calculated after measuring the volume of the compacted sample. The residual compacity of each fraction was calculated measuring the minimum void ratio of each fraction using the vibration method. The tensile strength of the particles was evaluated using the method of particle compression between two plates The Weibull parameter The transition probability was measured using a granular mixture with fractions having different colors, The mixture of particles was submitted to cyclic loading using a gyratory compactor. This equipment produces stress rotation similar than a moving wheel on a pavement layer. After 10 loading cycles, the mixture was separated in different fractions, and then the transition probability was measured based on the proportion of the mass of each color that change into another fraction. Experimental transition probabilities were measured for each grain fraction and were calculated depending on the relationship In addition to the previous experimental work, a set of triaxial tests were carried out on dry material resulting in friction angles, at the critical state, of 51° for material 1 and 49° for materials 2 and 3. To verify the predictions of the model, the three different granular materials were tested in a gyratory compactor. This device applies vertical and shear stresses as in a simple shear apparatus but in a gyratory way, Materials were prepared at a same initial grain size distribution, then gyratory tests were performed applying 10, 100, and 1000 loading cycles, afterwards the evolution of the grain size distribution was measured by sieve analysis. The model proposed in this paper was applied to reproduce the experimental results. The set of parameters that uses the model comes from different sources: Parameters Macroscopic stress Parameter Parameter Parameters Parameters  From  Another advantage of the model presented in this paper is the possibility of assessing the evolution of the grain size distribution up to a very high number of loading cycles as it is shown in This paper presents a new model to assess comminution of granular materials under cyclic loading. As a first subject, this paper describes a linear packing model that has been used for proportioning concrete mixtures but presents high potentialities in geotechnical engineering. In fact, the linear packing model reproduce maximum and minimum void ratio of granular mixtures having particles of different shape and mixtures with different a coefficient of uniformity. Also, the LPM can describe the compressibility of granular mixtures. However, regarding compressibility and compaction, further researches are needed to find out the relationship between compaction energy and the packing coefficient of the mixture Regarding micromechanics of granular mixtures, the LPM can describe the state of each granulometric class within the granular mixture. In fact, the mean load between particles, calculated using a DEM, have a clear relationship with the filling coefficient calculated using the LPM. On the other hand, a clear relationship between floating particles calculated using both models, DEM and LPM, shows a remarkable linear relationship. Relationships for stresses and floating particles indicates that the filling coefficient calculated using the LPM is a good descriptor of the state of the particles between the granular mixture, and becomes a strong parameter to links micro and macro mechanics of granular materials. The comminution model presented in this paper combines the linear packing model with Markovian processes. The results of this model show that it can predict successfully the evolution of grain size distribution. In addition, the model requires very low computational cost and can work down to the smaller particles in the mixture. The good performance of the model suggests that it can be a useful tool to link micro to macro behavior including it in macroscopic models such as FEM or FDM that are based in continue mechanics. The experimental data required for the model are reachable using well-known tests such as compression tests of particles between plates and gyratory compaction tests. However, more tests are required to evaluate the reduction of the strength of particles due to fatigue. Despite the good performance of the proposed model, it is important to note that it considers simultaneously the evolution of the grain size distribution due to abrasion and crushing. As the mechanism for these two effects are different, further developments could evaluate abrasion and crushing separately this is possible including two transition probabilities, one for crushing and another for abrasion. By definition, the virtual compacity of the mixture, When the bigger grains are dominant, these grains fill up the volume without interacting with the small grains. Then, the compacity of grains 1 within the mixture, And then: On the other hand, when the small grains are dominant, these grains fill the space between the bigger grains, that is 1 As a result, the virtual compacity The hypothesis, in this case, consists in assuming that that the compacity This equation allows calculating each partial volume in terms of the other one: The virtual compacity Or, As the partial volumes Finally: For the case of binary mixtures with However, in this case, the partial volume Then the virtual compacity However considering volumetric relationships, This equation results in: This equation must be valid for the extreme cases of no interaction and total interaction, this condition is achieved if the function The wall effect occurs at the contact between big and small grains when the small grains are dominant. Under these circumstances, the compacity equation becomes: However, the small grains can’t reach the maximum compacity As Also, in this case, the wall effect function, The case of a polydisperse mixture with The class And the virtual compacity results from the addition of all partial volumes of the different classes: That becomes: However, as And finally, the virtual compacity when the class In the case of a polydisperse mixture with partial interaction, grains with size To calculate the actual compacity of the mixture, The compressible packing model was developed in However As Considering that Σ
