In an attempt to resolve the problem of poor clean coal quality and low ash content of tailing in the mixed flotation technology, factors affecting flotation performance were studied by orthogonal experiments, sieve analysis, progressive release flotation test and statistical methods. The classification flotation technology based on 0.125mm as the classification size was introduced, in which the key technology was the application of classification cyclone to separate the flotation feed. The 0.125-0mm fine coal slime was processed by innovative cyclone micro-bubble flotation column and clean coal filter press, while the 0.5â€“0.125mm coarse coal slimes were dealt with flotation machines and disc vacuum filters. The research results show that a decrease of 1.12% in the ash content of flotation clean coal and an increase of 9.51% in the ash content of flotation tailing coincide with the application of the classification flotation technology. Meanwhile, the corresponding clean coal recovery increases by 2.61%.
