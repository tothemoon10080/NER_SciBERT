Mechanical and structural properties of Zr50Ni27Ni18Co5 (at.%) and Ni59Zr16Ti13Nb7Sn3Si2 (at.%) amorphous alloys were studied before and after hydrogenation. In both alloys, upon hydrogenation, a significant reduction in mechanical properties was evident. The occurrence of hydrogen embrittlement was supported by fracture morphology and is further explained based on the corresponding structural changes induced by hydrogenation.In recent times, amorphous alloys have been widely considered in fuel cell technology as hydrogen permeable membranes for reformers, in order to separate hydrogen from gas mixtures The purpose of the present work was to study the hydrogen embrittlement behaviour of cathodically charged Zr Melt spun Zr In order to study the embrittlement occurring due to hydrogen, bend ductility tests were conducted on un-charged and charged specimens. The strain to fracture ( In addition, charged Zr-alloys do not show any embrittlement till ∼13  Based on the observations made from XRD, it can be seen that the presence of hydrogen affects the structural properties as well, and hence it would be worthwhile to relate these changes to the observed embrittlement behaviour. Considering the role of the alloying elements present, Zr atoms possess highest hydrogen affinity (enthalpy of mixing for Zr with H: −19 Based on the atomic structural model for metallic glasses proposed by Miracle The hydrogen embrittlement behaviour of Zr This work was funded by KIST Research Program 2E18470.
