Grinding ball fragments discharging from SAG mills and ball mills cause extreme wear to downstream processing equipment. These ball fragments, circulating in a milling circuit, will cause excessive wear to sumps, pumps, hydrocyclones and interconnecting piping. Grinding ball fragments contribute very little to the grinding process while consuming power.
                  Magnetic separation applied to milling circuits to remove the recirculating grinding media has evolved over several years. Magnetic separation techniques have been successfully applied to ball mill circuits as well as SAG mill circuits.
                  The Trunnion Magnet separator was developed and improved over the years to remove grinding ball fragments directly from the mill discharge. The removal of grinding media from the ball mill discharge has resulted in several benefits in the milling circuit. Reported benefits taken from various installations are:
                        
                           •
                           Extended the pump life and the hydrocyclone life of approximately 250%.
                        
                        
                           •
                           An increase in mill throughput of a nominal 5%.
                        
                        
                           •
                           A nominal 8% reduction in mill power consumption.
                        
                        
                           •
                           More efficient grinding resulting in a nominal 10% reduction in the mill work index.
                        
                     
                  
                  Magnetic separation has also been recently applied to the SAG mill discharge. Suspended electromagnetic and rotating drum type magnetic separators have been designed to “pick-up” the grinding media in the coarse oversize recirculating product. In addition, rotating drum type magnetic separators have been developed to remove grinding media in the fine undersize product that that reports to the sump.Extended the pump life and the hydrocyclone life of approximately 250%. An increase in mill throughput of a nominal 5%. A nominal 8% reduction in mill power consumption. More efficient grinding resulting in a nominal 10% reduction in the mill work index. Magnetic separation systems to remove grinding ball fragments from the mill discharge have been developed and successfully applied in the milling circuit. These magnetic separation systems were first applied at the Escondida copper concentrator in Chile in 1996 ( Since the inception of the Trommel Magnet, magnetic separation techniques have evolved and have become more effective and efficient. Magnetic separation has now been applied to various milling operations worldwide. Descriptions of the applications follow. The magnetic collection of grinding media from milling circuits first began with the introduction of pebble crushers. Recirculating SAG mill trommel oversize to a pebble crusher required the effective removal of grinding ball fragments. This was necessary to remove the oversize grinding ball fragments to prevent blockage and damage to the crushers. The usual method to remove these grinding balls is with suspended electromagnets over the belt feeding the pebble crusher. This application required an electromagnet designed to generate a high magnetic field to effectively collect grinding balls. The more recent and more effective method however is to use a magnet positioned over the deck screens or at the discharge of the SAG trommel screen. The SAG Mill discharge stream is frequently classified with a screen deck. The screen deck scalps the oversize material, which in turn is routed to the pebble crusher and back to the SAG mill feed. A new approach has been developed to magnetically collect ferrous grinding media from the screen oversize. A rotating magnetic drum mounted over the discharge lip of the screen effectively collects ferrous grinding media. These drums can often utilize rare earth permanent magnets thus eliminating the need for a power demanding electromagnet. The separator utilizes an electromagnet or permanent magnet to generates a deep magnetic field. The drum rotates around the stationary magnetic element. Ferrous material passing under the drum is attracted to the magnetic element and is held to the surface of the drum. The ferrous material is rotated over the top of the drum and discharged into a separate bin. This is a more effective approach than using a suspended electromagnet over the conveyor belt that feeds the pebble crusher. The rotating drum offers the following benefits Ore that would otherwise be speeding along on a conveyor belt is spread out and moving much slower on the screen deck. The ore is presented to the drum essentially as a monolayer. Iron objects are not hindered by a “dead burden” as on a conveyor belt. The magnetic drum can be placed very close (0.2–0.3 The material is agitated while subjected to separation releasing physically entrapped ore. Long bars or rods can be safely removed before they spear a belt. The Trunnion Magnet is an enhancement of the initial Trommel Magnet. The enhancement involved both magnetic as well as non-magnetic refinements. These improvements were necessary to magnetically collect grinding ball fragments directly from the mill discharge stream without the use or requirement of a trommel screen. The magnet barrel (or blind trommel) is bolted directly to the discharge flange of the mill and is coupled with an arc of permanent magnets to collect grinding media. The Trunnion Magnet includes four basic components as shown in In the design of the Trunnion Magnet, consideration was given to the magnetic capture of grinding balls/fragments directly opposed by the drag force of the mill discharge slurry. Several techniques are used in the magnet design to compensate for the drag force. First, high-energy rare earth magnets have been used in conjunction with the barium ferrite magnets in a hybrid magnetic circuit to increase the magnetic force. This provides a magnetic force of over three times that required to lift the grinding ball. Second, the magnetic arc can be extended along the length of the magnet barrel to increase the retention time that the mill discharge stream is exposed to the magnetic field. And third, magnetically induced lifters inside the magnet barrel can be used to assist in the collection of ball chips. A typical installation will take 16–20 The benefits derived from the Trunnion Magnet system installed on a ball mill have been published earlier ( A study has recently been performed detailing the operating characteristics of a ball mill before and after the installation of the Trunnion Magnet system. This study was conducted at the Northgate Exploration’s Kemess Mine in British Columbia. The Kemess deposit is a gold–copper porphyry. The ore is processed using conventional crushing, grinding and flotation techniques to produce gold–copper concentrates. There are two parallel grinding circuits, each operating at a nominal rate of 25,000 Operating characteristics were measured before and after the installation of the Trunnion Magnet system on a ball mill. The results are summarized as follows: Total mill feed (TPH)—the total feed was essentially unchanged averaging approximately 1300 TPH. Total mill power (kW)—the mill power dropped 8% from an average of 7600–7000 Mill work index (kW-h/T)—the mill work index dropped 10% from an average of 5.5–5.0 In addition, the amount of ferrous grinding media magnetically collected from the mill discharge was monitored. 46  The SAG mill discharge is typically classified in one of the two ways. The two methods are detailed as follows: The SAG mill discharge is classified on screen decks. In this application a suspended electromagnet or drum type magnet suspended over the screen deck collects the oversize grinding media as it transverses the screen deck. The SAG mill discharge is classified on a trommel screen. In this application the SAG mill discharge is treated with a Trunnion Magnet or a drum type magnet to collect the grinding media as it discharges the mill. The Trunnion Magnet is replaces the trommel screen and removes grinding ball fragments directly from the mill discharge. In addition, there are a few other applications for magnetic separation. The SAG mill oversize reporting to the pebble crusher is conveyed under a suspended electromagnet. The magnet collects grinding media and removes it prior to the crusher. A Trunnion Magnet is mounted at the ball mill discharge. The Trunnion Magnet is replaces the trommel screen and removes grinding ball fragments directly from the mill discharge. In each case, the grinding media is collected and discharged into a separate hopper. Reported benefits taken from various installations include extended the pump life and hydrocyclone life, increase in mill throughput, reduction in mill power consumption, and more efficient grinding. It should be noted that the analyses presented in this report should be taken as indicators. It is difficult at best to provide a precise comparative analysis in a mineral concentrator. Specific characteristics of different mills as well as irregularities in the operation have to be accounted.
