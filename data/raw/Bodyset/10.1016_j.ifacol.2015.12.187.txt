This paper deals with a grey-box model identification of a catalytic ozonation pilot process used in wastewater treatment. The grey-box model is presented. For the parametric estimation, a non convex optimization problem must be solved. Then, we propose to solve this problem, in practice, by using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm applied to a composite criterion based on a priori knowledge which imposes a physical meaning to the solution. The method is applied to experimental data.
