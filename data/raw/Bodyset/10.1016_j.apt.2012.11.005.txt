A gas–solid fluidized bed has been used to separate particulate iron ore (+250–500μm in size) by segregating the particles by density. The ore particles were put into a cylindrical column of inner diameter of 100mm and bed height of 50mm, and were fluidized at a given air velocity u
                     0/u
                     mf
                     =1.2–3.2 for 10 min. u
                     0 and u
                     mf are the superficial air velocity and the minimum fluidization air velocity, respectively. The bulk density of the ore particles after fluidization was measured as a function of height through the bed in 5mm increments (the 50mm height was divided into 10 layers) to investigate the density-segregation. The size of the particles in each of the 10 layers was also measured to investigate size-segregation. It was found that both density-segregation and size-segregation occurred as a function of height through the bed after fluidization at u

                     mf
                     =2.0. However, the segregation did not occur near the bottom of the bed for lower u

                     mf. The origin of the segregation-dependence on the air velocity was discussed considering the air bubbles size and the fluidizing intensity at upper and lower sections of the bed. The Fe content of the 10 layers at u

                     =2.0 was measured to calculate the Fe-grade and Fe-recovery. The ore-recovery was also calculated using the weight of ore particles as a function of height through the bed. The feed Fe-grade (before separation) was 52.1wt%. If the ore particles in the bottom half of the bed were regarded as the product, the Fe-grade was 59.0wt%, and the Fe-recovery and the ore-recovery were 68.5wt% and 60.5wt%, respectively.Mineral processing is an indispensable process to produce high grade minerals from run-of-mine ores. Generally, the valuable minerals in run-of-mine ores are recovered by wet separations such as dense medium separation for lump ore and froth flotation for fine particulate ore Basically, there are two possibilities for dry separation using a gas–solid fluidized bed. One method is a dry separation based on “float-sink” of lump ores in a dense medium of fluidized sand. The fluidized bed of sand has liquid-like properties such as density and viscosity Another method is a dry separation based on “segregation” of the ore particles in a fluidized bed (without any dense medium). When a mixture of particles is fluidized, heavier or larger particles move down and lighter or smaller particles move up in the fluidized bed. The segregation which is based on both density difference and size difference is generally called “density-segregation” and “size-segregation”, respectively. Segregation in a fluidized bed has been widely investigated Typical run-of-mine lump iron ore from Western Australia was supplied by an Australian mining company. The lump iron ore was crushed using a jaw crusher. The fine particulate iron ore of +250–500 The apparatus for separation consists of a cylindrical acrylic column (inner diameter of 100 The ore particles were put into the column to a depth of 50 The concentration of Fe,   Hereafter, the origin of the segregation-dependence on the air velocity will be discussed considering the size of the air bubbles and the fluidization intensity in the upper and lower layers. Small air bubbles are generated at the bottom of the fluidized bed. The bubbles coalesce with each other becoming larger as they move up through the fluidized bed. When the air velocity is small, the size of air bubbles in the lower layers is so small that the fluidization intensity is too weak to produce segregation. But, the larger size of air bubbles in the upper layers is large enough to cause the segregation in the upper layers. When the air velocity is large, the size of air bubbles and the fluidization intensity in the lower layers is reasonable for the segregation. But, in the upper layers, the fluidization of the ore particles is so intense that segregation cannot occur. Therefore, there exists anoptimum air velocity to cause the good segregation through all the layers.
