High-gradient magnetic separation based processing is demonstrated for the semi-continuous multicycle re-use of a lipase immobilised on magnetic microparticles. The lipase of Candida antarctica A-type (CALA) was immobilised on polyvinyl alcohol coated magnetic particles (1–2μm diameter) with epoxy functionalisation. The immobilised CALA was used to hydrolyse a model oil-water 2-phase-system composed of a phosphate buffer with tributyrin at up to 3l scale. The immobilised enzyme was subsequently recovered in a magnetic filter using high-gradient magnetic separation and reapplied in repeated cycles of hydrolysis and recovery. Two different temperatures of 30 and 50°C, tributyrin concentrations (0.12 and 35gl−1) and reaction times were tested. In each case the reaction was followed by pH titration using NaOH, as well as by HPLC analysis. Consecutive cycles were conducted for each reaction condition and in total the immobilised CALA was subjected to 20 recovery and re-use cycles, after which ∼14% of the initial specific activity still remained.Enzyme-catalysed chemical transformations are now widely recognised as practical alternatives to traditional (non-biological) organic synthesis, and as efficient solutions to synthetic processes ( Recent work on magnetic separation of immobilised enzymes has been published in which the recovery and multiple re-use of an immobilised lipase was investigated in bench scale (  Poly vinyl alcohol epoxy-activated magnetic beads (M-PVA E02) were obtained from Chemagen Biopolymer Technologie AG (Baesweiler, Germany) and according to the manufacturer they contained 50–60% magnetic material. Furthermore, the density of functional groups as determined by the manufacturer was 200 A-type lipase (CALA), Novozym L868 was purchased from Novozymes A/S (Bagsværd, Denmark). The stock solution had a protein concentration of 10 CALA was immobilised on M-PVA E02 particles as described in The free and immobilised CALA (batch 2) were resuspended in 0.1 Small-scale studies were conducted in a temperature controlled and stirred batch reactor with a final volume of 30 Mini-pilot scale studies were conducted in a temperature controlled (30 or 50 A laboratory type ‘on-off’ permanent magnet based high-gradient magnetic separator (Steinert HGF-10, Steinert Elektromagnetbau GmbH, Köln, Germany) was employed of the type designed for biological applications ( A schematic of the setup designed here for immobilised enzyme processing is shown in At the start of each campaign the batch reactor was filled with phosphate buffer, tributyrin added, stirring initiated, and the system brought to the relevant operating temperature. The immobilised enzyme suspended in phosphate buffer was added and the reaction allowed to proceed for 0.33 The activity of the immobilised enzyme on magnetic particles was measured using the spectrophotometric assay described in A pH stat system was used for determination of the activity of free and immobilised lipase when reacting in tributyrin containing media. One unit of activity (U) is defined as 1 The tributyrin cleavage products were identified and analysed by HPLC using a Dionex system equipped with a RI and UV detector, the latter at 210 The concentration of protein was determined using the Bradford assay ( The magnetic particle concentration was determined gravimetrically using a dry-weight method as described in The multiple recovery and re-use of immobilised CALA were attempted first in bench scale using a bar magnet for enzyme capture and then transferred to mini-pilot scale using an integrated HGMS system for enzyme handling. However, prior to recycling studies, the properties of the enzyme preparation were examined with the model oil substrate. Kinetic studies were conducted at 25 In total, eight recovery and re-use cycles of immobilised CALA (batch 1) in bench scale were performed at 30 The bench scale experiments indicated that the enzyme was stable for five cycles at 30 In light of the successful regeneration of the immobilised enzyme, the catalyst was thus applied to a further four cycles in campaign 2 ( Following the success of campaigns 1 and 2 and the high residual activity of the immobilised enzyme, 1.5 The results presented here showed a decline in apparent activity of the immobilised enzyme from cycle to cycle during HGMS processing, which could be reversed by employing a thorough washing protocol until the enzyme had been re-used 20 times. Subsequently regeneration was not possible using the protocols employed here. Loss of immobilised enzyme activity during cycles of re-use has been observed by other workers and various causes have been proposed. For example  One generic advantage of HGMS is that very challenging crude feedstocks can be treated due to the high voidage of the filters and the technique has thus been applied successfully since the 1970's for mineral processing and waste water treatment ( We thank Chemagen Biopolymer Technologie AG (Baesweiler, Germany) for supply of the M-PVA magnetic particles with epoxy surface activation for the immobilisation of lipases.
