Application of mole fractions and volume ones for creation of mathematical model for extraction processes with TBP was discussed. Method for calculating activity coefficients was provided. Water distribution was taken into account due to the significant importance of free water. Calculation of activity coefficients in three major systems, namely: H2O-TBP, H2O-HNO3-TBP-diluent, H2O-UO2(NO3) 2-TBP was performed. Information on experimental data and optimization criterion was provided. It shown that new method can provide adequate description of the system H2O-HNO3-UO2(NO3) 2-TBP-diluent and its subsystems. Three major potential challenges have been identified.
