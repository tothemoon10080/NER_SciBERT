This chapter discusses the process of electrowinning to produce pure metallic copper from leach or solvent extraction electrolytes. It entails applying an electrical potential between inert lead (Pb) alloy anodes and stainless steel cathodes in electrolyte. As a result, pure copper electroplates on the cathodes and oxygen is generated at the anodes. The copper (Cu) is stripped from the cathode and sold. The oxygen joins the atmosphere and the oxidized copper (Cu++) depleted electrolyte is returned to solvent extraction for Cu++ replenishment. Electrowon copper is purer than electrorefined copper. The only significant impurities are sulfur, lead, and iron. These impurity concentrations can be decreased through careful control and attention. The basic electrowinning products are pure copper metal at the cathode, oxygen gas at the anode, and regenerated sulfuric acid in the solution. The most important need for copper electrowinning is an inert anode to reduce the need for cell cleaning and to minimize the Pb contamination.
