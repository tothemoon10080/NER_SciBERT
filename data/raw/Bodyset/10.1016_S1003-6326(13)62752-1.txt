Phase transitions, morphology changes, and oxidation mechanism of the ilmenite oxidation process were investigated. FeTiO3 transforms to hematite and rutile when oxidation at 700–800 °C, and pseudobrookite is formed when the oxidation temperature reaches 900 °C. The initial ilmenite powder exhibits paramagnetism; however, after being oxidized at the intermediate temperature (800–850 °C), the oxidation product exhibits weak ferromagnetism. The oxidation mechanism was discussed. The microstructure observations show that a lot of micro-pores emerge on the surfaces of ilmenite particles at the intermediate temperature, which is deemed to be capable of enhancing the mass transfer of oxygen during oxidation.
