Biomarkers of type X collagen References Type X collagen is a network-forming collagen. It is mainly expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes in cartilage, of the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate, and in the calcified zone of articular cartilage of long bones, where type X collagen seems to facilitate calcification, and in human lumbar intervertebral discs. More than 30 different mutations have now been characterized. The most common genetic disorder is Schmidt metaphyseal chondrodysplasia. Only now are biomarkers of type X collagen emerging, which have been shown to be elevated in rheumatological disorders affecting bone and cartilage as well as in cancer. Type X collagen is a network-forming collagen. It is mainly expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes in cartilage. The expression is usually limited to the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate, in the calcified zone of articular cartilage of long bones, and in human lumbar intervertebral discs Increased extracellular deposition and expression of type X collagen are found in joint degenerative diseases as the chondrocytes become hypertrophic The biological function of type X collagen seems to be to facilitate the process of calcification and to play a role in the normal distribution of matrix vesicles and proteoglycans within the growth plate Type X collagen has also been found to be relevant in cancer. In a gene-expression analysis COL10A1 was elevated in multiple solid tumor types compared to normal tissue and when evaluated by IHC was found primarily in proximity of the vasculature Type X collagen serves as a marker of the terminally differentiated, hypertrophic chondrocytes ( Type X collagen has also been assessed in serum of approximately 400 patients with different solid tumor types using a polyclonal COL10A1 sandwich ELISA Inactivation of the
