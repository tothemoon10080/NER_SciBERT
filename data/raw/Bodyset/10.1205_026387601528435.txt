The following is a list of authors and titles of PhD theses (with names of research supervisors) in chemical engineering accepted in Universities with courses accredited by the IChemE during the academic year 1999–2000. From 1993 the list was extended to cover universities worldwide in addition to information for the United Kingdomand Ireland which has been published in the journal since 1981. The list is compiled each year from information supplied directly by the Heads of D partments of Chemical Engineering. Some information about earlier years is available in “Index to Theses…” obtainable from ASLIB, Information House, 26/27 Boswell Street, London WC1N 3JZ in printed form, or on magnetic tape from Learned Information Ltd, Besselsleigh Road, Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Many of these are held by the British Library, Boston Spa, Yorkshire and can be made available to registered users of this library
