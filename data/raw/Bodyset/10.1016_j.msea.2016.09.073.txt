In this paper, the effect of carbon and other alloying elements partitioning on ferrite hardening behavior were studied in details using a low alloy AISI4340 ferrite-martensite dual phase (DP) steel. To do so, various re-austenitised samples at 860°C for 60min were isothermally heated at 650°C from 3 to 60min and then water–quenched to obtain the final ferrite-martensite DP microstructures containing different ferrite and martensite volume fractions. Light and electron microscopic observations were supplemented with electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and nanoindentation tests to explore the localized compositional and hardening variations within ferrite grains in DP samples. The experimental results showed that the ferrite hardness was varied with progress of austenite to ferrite phase transformation in DP samples. In the case of a particular ferrite grain in a particular DP sample, despite a homogeneous distribution of carbon concentration, the ferrite hardness was significantly increased by increasing distance from the central location toward the interfacial α/γ areas. Beside a considerable influence of martensitic phase transformation on adjacent ferrite hardness, these results were rationalized in part to the significant level of Cr and Mo pile-up at α/γ interfaces leading to higher solid solution hardening effect of these regions. The reduction of potential energy developed by attractive interaction between C-Cr and C-Mo couples toward the carbon enriched prior austenite areas were the dominating driving force for pile-up segregation.The origin of invention and development of advanced low alloy ferrite-martensite dual phase (DP) steels have been the permanent interest of automotive industry to manufacturing light, safe and cheap vehicles. Outstanding mechanical properties of DP steels have attracted a huge interest in research, modification, and development of new generation of these steels for decades There is now a broad consensus that the excellent mechanical properties of low alloy DP steels such as low elastic limit, continuous yielding and high strain hardening rate are developed as a consequence of austenite to martensite phase transformation, which involves volume expansion inducing plastic deformation into adjacent ferrite grains, and therefore creating a high density of unpinned geometrically necessary dislocations within ferrite causing a higher work hardening effect of ferrite. Several investigations Newly conducted experimental works have been focused on carbon partitioning within ferrite and respective significant variation of mechanical properties within a particular ferrite grain in a particular DP microstructure In this study, a commercial grade of low alloy AISI4340 steel with the chemical composition shown in For accurate examination on hardening variations within ferrite grains, nanoindentation tests were conducted on the mechanically polished, electropolished and etched surfaces of DP specimens, using a CSM machine model NHTX S/N: 00103119 with a Berkovich indenter by applying an increasing force up to 5 Typical microstructural features of DP specimens heat treated at 650    A visual observation of light and electron micrographs shows that the step quench schedule utilized in this study has been associated with the microstructures with alternate blocky ferrite grains and big packets of martensite areas ( EDS line scan analyses have been widely conducted within various ferrite and martensite microphases in order to follow the carbon and substitutional alloying elements partitioning developed during progress of ferrite formation in the samples. Although the results of EDS carbon chemical analyses exhibit that a uniform carbon partitioning has been developed within ferrite grains during phase transformation, a remarkable inhomogeneity in prior austenite carbon concentration can be observed within the associated martensite areas particularly near the prior α/γ interfaces ( As no evidence of variation in carbon concentration has been found in ferrite grains, the EDS analyses have been extended to track possible partitioning of substitutional alloying elements within ferrite and martensite areas. For this reason, the same procedure as carbon concentration measurement has been applied to follow the partitioning of Ni, Cr, and Mo atoms within ferrite and prior austenite areas, and the associated data are presented in To examine hardening variation of ferrite, nanohardness test has been carried out within ferrite grains in the samples obtained at 650 To explore individual ferrite hardening response in the microstructures, the load/unload-displacement curves are drawn for applied load, exceeding to a maximum value of 5mN as a function of displacement on loading and unloading steps. The positions of A, B, and C on each curve shown in  The experimental results indicate that in a specific ferrite grain in all the DP treated samples, a significant change in carbon concentration has not occurred from the central location toward the prior α/γ interfacial regions, while the average ferrite carbon concentration has been remarkably decreased from 10.90 to 7.41EDSNs with increasing isothermal holding time from 10 to 60 It is obvious that the time-dependent for carbon diffusion within ferrite and so the partitioning of carbon atoms to remaining prior austenite areas have been more facilitated under predetermined condition of a relatively long time DP treatment at 650 In this work, although a homogeneous carbon partitioning has been developed within ferrite grains, a significant build-up of Cr and Mo segregation has occurred within ferrite areas close to prior α/γ interfaces especially in the prolonged DP treatments ( The segregation of Cr and Mo atoms at ferrite areas in vicinity of α/γ interfaces can be firstly concerned to the reduction of strain energy due to difference between their atomic sizes with that of solvent atoms, Fe The nanoindentation measurements conducted within ferrite grains show that the ferrite hardness has been varied as austenite to ferrite phase transformation has been progressed. The average ferrite hardness has been decreased from 368 to 343HV5 The higher ferrite hardness in vicinity of prior α/γ interfacial regions can be associated in part with the austenite to martensite phase transformation causing localized plastic strains within adjacent ferrite areas by generation of more dislocation on the subsequent water quenching from 650 It is interesting to point out that in contrary to uniform carbon partitioning and so uniform carbon hardening contribution within ferrite grains, the segregation of carbide forming alloying elements, Cr and Mo can be associated with a strong contribution to ferrite hardening variation. On the other hand, the higher dissolution of alloying elements into the ferrite areas with its unavoidable occurrence of lattice distortions and creation of stress fields around solute Fe atoms can play an important role in mechanical behavior of ferrite in the samples. In this manner, it is obvious that the comprehensive partitioning of Cr and Mo at prior α/γ interfacial regions accompanied by progress of ferritic phase transformation can be related to the possibility of higher segregation of these elements to the induced dislocations as well as more interaction between their stress fields with Fe atoms leading to a higher ability to constrain the mobility of geometrically necessary dislocations which enhances ferrite phase resistance to deformation through solid solution hardening mechanism. Therefore, uneven partitioning for alloying elements of Cr and Mo within ferrite in conjunction with mutual ferrite-martensite interaction generating a significant density of geometrically necessary dislocations within ferrite are considered to be responsible for inhomogeneity of ferrite hardening in the DP microstructures. Ferrite hardening variation in a low alloy AISI4340 ferrite-martensite DP steel in relation to possible carbon and substitutional alloying elements partitioning within ferrite have been studied over a wide range of ferrite and martensite volume fractions. The conclusions are as following: The austenite to ferrite phase transformation has been proceeded consistently with increasing isothermal holding time. By lengthening holding time period from 3 to 60 Austenite to ferrite phase transformation has been accompanied by producing lower carbon concentrated ferrite grains with increasing holding time. A remarkable decreasing of carbon concentration from 10.90 to 7.41EDSNs has been occurred within ferrite grains as the holding time is increased from 10 to 60 At 650 The average ferrite nanohardness has been decreased from 368 to 343HV5 The ferrite hardness has been largely variable within a particular ferrite grain in all of the DP specimens. A remarkable increasing of ferrite hardness has been occurred from 329 to 429HV5
