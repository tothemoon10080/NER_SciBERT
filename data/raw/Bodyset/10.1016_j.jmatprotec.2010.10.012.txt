Millipede forming, a novel sheet metal forming method, has been proposed and developed recently to overcome fundamental limitations in conventional roll forming. For this new method, there are two main aspects: use of an optimal transitional surface and implementation of a method to feed the strip through the transition surface. Achieving the optimal transitional surface involves defining the change of surface shape between a flat strip and a final shaped product conceptualised to the strip's mid-surface, regardless of the strip's thickness.
                  In this paper, one method of implementing a transition surface, Millipede forming, is introduced. A prototype has been built to demonstrate the working principle and can be used to produce some simple profiles, within a short forming length of 200mm.For mass production of long sheet products with a unique profile, conventional roll forming is highly efficient. Although roll forming has been developed for many years, the technology still has elements of an “art” instead of a science. In particular, a successful roll forming schedule relies more on the designer's and on-site engineer's experience than on any forming theories. Hence “trial and error” approaches still dominate the work of developing a new product due to the complexity of the process of roll forming itself. Close observation and analysis of the deformation process, shows that the roll forming process inherently involves strain path differences due to unnecessary deformations such as longitudinal stretching and bending and in-plane shearing, between adjacent roll stands. During a study of circular sections, These redundant strain components are independent of the span space of the roll stands, and lead to product defects such as edge wave, flare, sweep or camber, twist, and so on. Some defects can be eliminated for some light gauge low strength material by applying tension at the exit end. However, this method will increase the production cost and damage the surface of the product, especially for pre-coated material. Another possible mechanism of surface damage in roll forming is the sliding between the roll and strip that can occur because of non-uniform longitudinal stretching and the relative velocity between roll and strip in contact. More challenges arise due to new materials being introduced to roll forming, such as light metals and composites, and thinner and higher strength products. Meanwhile, ultrahigh strength steel is being introduced to the automobile industry to make the vehicle body in order to increase the strength/weight ratio. Furthermore, part of the material (mostly the edges) goes through a process of elongation–compression or compression–elongation before and after passing a roll stand. This loading and unloading of the material is not necessary to achieve the required deformation but unavoidable in roll forming. This repeated loading–unloading on a small local area not only consumes a substantial amount of power but also increases the occurrence of production defects. All the problems discussed above are implicit in the fundamental working principle of roll forming,   Such a transitional surface can be constructed and analysed using simple theory suggested by Ideally, the designed transitional surface can be formed by a pair of specially designed dies arranged in above and below the strip having a gap compensating the strip's thickness, as shown in The details of the working sequence correspond to the series of shaft angles 1–8 shown in During the sequence of times or shaft angles from 5 to 9, as shown in The strip's motion is also expressed in A 2-phase prototype machine has been designed and assembled for demonstrating the working principle, as shown in All die-slices are pre-assembled to sets named die-arrays and mounted to the corresponding driving mechanism. The advantages of this arrangement are that after permanent assembly the die blocks can be cut to the final profile, so that the alignment is no longer necessary and except for maintenance and replacement. Replacing the tooling for different products would require relatively little time and re-alignment is not necessary. There are also inherent safety advantages in the relatively compact direct configuration which eliminates open access of dangerous nip points. Samples of pre-assembled tooling for a channel section and a circular tube are shown in To examine the residual stresses along axial direction, the channel sample is cut to a few 25 The almost continuous forming almost eliminates unnecessary loading cycles and associated redundant plastic deformation. Hence the causes of most product defects are eliminated in principle. Millipede forming is introduced and appears to be a successful process to optimally manipulate a strip through a designed optimal transitional surface with less redundant deformation. The advantages of Millipede forming over conventional roll forming are expected to be:        Millipede forming is still under development and requires much further research. One important issue needing to be addressed in further development, is operation speed. The operation speed is determined by the stroke of the die slices via the eccentric radius, the number of phases and the rotation speed. The allowed stroke has a positive relationship to material thickness, The authors would like to thank
