More importantly, Mg-doping, as opposed to Al-doping, suppresses the deleterious reactions with the atmospheric moisture/CO2, leading to stability in the composition-phase-structure upon exposure to air. Accordingly, when exposed to air, even though Al-doped LLZO pellets get spontaneously fractured/disintegrated, accompanied by reduction in ionic conductivity by ~3 orders of magnitude, Mg-doped LLZO shows no sign of cracking and almost retains the ionic conductivity measured prior to exposure.Lithium lanthanum zirconate (Li In a recently published work [ In order to address this major issue with LLZO (including Al-doped LLZO), new dopants need to be identified, which, in addition to stabilizing the cubic garnet phase at room temperature, would also enhance the composition-phase-structural stability under ambient conditions. In this context, the present communication reports on the usage of Mg (which is not far behind Al in terms of abundance in Earth's crust), as a dopant in LLZO, for the first time. As will be discussed in the following, Mg-doping has indeed been found to serve the dual purpose; unlike similar level of Al-doping. Mg-doped and Al-doped LLZO powders were synthesized via sol-gel route using high purity LiNO ICP-AES analysis (using SPECTRO Analytical Instruments GmbH) performed with powders obtained upon grinding the sintered pellets in Ar-filled glove-box indicate that the molar ratios of Li:Al:La:Zr and Li:Mg:La:Zr are ~6.26:0.31:2.89:1.76 and ~6.46:0.22:2.79:1.82 for the Al-doped and Mg-doped LLZO pellets, respectively. It may be noted that ICP does not detect any Al in Mg-doped LLZO and Mg in Al-doped LLZO. X-ray diffraction studies (XRD; using Rigaku Smartlab X-ray diffractometer) confirm the development of phase pure LLZO pellets, having the desired cubic garnet structure (viz., Lattice parameter of the cubic unit cell in the case of Mg-doped LLZO, as estimated from the XRD pattern via Rietveld refinement (using FullProf suite; as presented in It may be recalled here that our recently published study with Al-doped LLZO indicated the occurrences of severe instability in the composition, phase and structural integrity, leading to spontaneous cracking/fracture/disintegration, upon exposure to ambient air [ Interestingly, within the detectable limits, Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrum (FTIR; using Vertex 80 system) obtained with Mg-doped LLZO pellet does not show any peak corresponding to (CO At this stage it is difficult to say exactly why Mg-doping, as opposed to Al-doping, suppresses the deleterious reactions of LLZO with the atmospheric species. One of the possible reasons could be the formation of a thin, but passivating Mg(OH) More importantly, there was absolutely no visual evidence for spontaneous fracture/cracking after exposure of Mg-doped LLZO to air for more than three weeks, unlike that for Al-doped LLZO. Additionally, closer look at the sub-surface regions via cross-section imaging (using dual-beam FIB/FEG-SEM; AurigaTM Compact, Carl Zeiss) indicate the presence of surface and sub-surface cracks for the Al-doped LLZO, but not in the case of Mg-doped LLZO (see In order to check for the Li-ion conductivity of the newly developed Mg-doped LLZO and the effect of exposure to air on the same, in comparison to that for Al-doped LLZO, impedance spectroscopy was performed using AC impedance analyzer (Novocontrol Technologies) by applying sinusoidal wave of amplitude 100 mV rms in the 1–13 MHz frequency range. Nyquist plots corresponding to the impedance spectra recorded prior to (i.e., after sintering) and after exposure to air for 24 days in the case of Mg-doped LLZO have been shown in In summary, we report here for the first time the use of Mg, as dopant, to stabilize the desired cubic garnet structure ( The financial supports from IRCC (  Supplementary data to this article can be found online at
