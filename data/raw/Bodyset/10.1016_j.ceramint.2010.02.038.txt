Aluminosilicate precursor for the processing of mulite ceramics was synthesized chemically from inorganic salts following colloidal route. V2O5 was used as a sintering additive in different ratios with the precursor powder. The powder mixes were compacted and sintered at different elevated temperatures. The sintered masses were characterized by measuring the bulk density, porosity, flexural strength and fracture toughness. The extent of mullitization and final microstructure of the sintered masses were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and XRD analysis. It was observed that V2O5 exhibited favourable effect on the formation of properly crystallized mullite and in the improvement of different mechanical properties.Mullite, having molecular formula Al Different transition metal oxides have been shown to have favourable mineralizing effect on the formation of mullite ceramics from the precursor materials In the present investigation effect of V Al(NO The generated silicic acid sol and Al(NO The precursor aluminosilicate was synthesized through an aqueous phase colloidal interaction of the starting materials under optimum condition to achieve molecular level mixing among the constituents. Silicic acid was generated by ion exchange process. As it is a positively charged colloid, it did not exhibit the tendency of polymerization. When silicic acid sol was mixed with Al(NO The precursor powder had a very low bulk density (0.27 It has been reported by other workers that mullite formation in diphasic aluminosilicate gel is controlled by dissolutionâ€“precipitation reactions, where Al In V In all the three oxides vanadium remains in octahedral co-ordination and the cationic radii of the three different oxidation states are like the following, V(+5) The aluminosilicate gel is basically consisted of AlO The substitution of aluminum by vanadium in octahedral site could cause aluminum ion vacancies according to the following defect reaction for aluminum sub-lattice. This fact could enhance the mass transport and consequently, the sintering rate of the aluminosilicate gel in presence of the V So theoretically V From the microstructures of the samples ( The mechanical strength like flexural strength and fracture toughness ( Aluminosilicate diphasic gel precursor of mullite was synthesized by the colloidal interaction of silicic acid and Al(NO
