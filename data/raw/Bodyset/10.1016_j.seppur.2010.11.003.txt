An oxidative pressure leaching process to extract silver from the silver-rich residue of demanganized silver–manganese sulfide concentrate with ammonium thiocyanate solution was investigated in this paper. The effects of several factors: temperature, leaching time, oxygen pressure, Fe3+ concentration, lignin concentration, and initial pH of the leaching reagent, on the extraction percentages of silver were studied. The following optimized leaching conditions were obtained: Fe3+ concentration 4.2g/L, lignin concentration 0.6g/L, NH4SCN concentration 1.5M, initial pH value 1.8, and oxygen pressure 1.4MPa at 120°C for 3h. Under these optimized conditions, the average extraction percentage of silver was about 88% and 6.5% of NH4SCN was lost after four cycles. The ammonium thiocyanate method has advantages over the conventional cyanidation method and chlorination method, with a higher efficiency, lower toxicity and better selectivity and stability.There are lots of complex silver–manganese sulfide ore and silver-bearing manganese oxide ore in Guangxi, Inner Mongolia and Fujian provinces in China. Their mineralogical compositions are complicated whereas these ores have high commercial value Recently, ammonium thiocyanate was selected as leaching reagent due to its many advantages, such as stability in weak acid solution, low toxicity The silver-rich residue was the filtrate residue of leaching the manganese from high-manganese silver sulfide concentrate and silver-containing manganese oxide ore with H  The laboratory-scale experiments were carried out in a 1.0 The leaching reagent comprised of 1.5 The experimental processes were as follows: at first, the reactor was loaded with 600 The residue samples were dissolved and oxidized using a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acid; then, the silver content was determined by an atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS, Analyst 400, PerkinElmer, Wellesley, MA). The concentration of silver ions was determined by KSCN titration using ammonium ferric sulfate as an indicator after the thiocyanate ions in filtrate were vaporized by adding sulfuric acid. The concentration of ferric ions in filtrate was determined by Volhard titration. The silver-rich residue was oxidized at the temperature of 25, 80, 110, 120, 130, 150  The silver-rich residue was oxidized with reaction times that varied from 0.5  The silver-rich residue was oxidized with pressure in autoclave (including oxygen and water vapor) at 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6  The additive amount of Fe As seen from According to the literature As can be seen from The silver-rich residue was oxidized with initial pH values of leaching reagent at 1.5, 1.7, 1.8, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0; the effects of initial pH values on the extraction percentages of silver and terminal pH values are presented in From Based on the mentioned single-factor experiments, four integrated experiments were conducted and the following optimized leaching conditions were chosen: lignin 0.6 The main mineralogical composition of the leached residues was still pyrite and quartz according to the XRD pattern ( On the other hand, we analyzed the total weight of SCN It can be seen from Eqs. The process flowsheet for the selective leaching of silver from the silver-rich residue of demanganized silver–manganese sulfide concentrate with ammonium thiocyanate solution is illustrated in According to the results of single-factor experiments, the optimal leaching conditions are obtained as follows: NH This project supported by the
