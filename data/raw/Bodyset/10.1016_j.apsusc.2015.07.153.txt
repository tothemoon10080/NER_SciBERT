A multilayer coating using electroless nickel-phosphorus (Ni–P) was applied on a twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) steel containing nominally 25wt.% Mn and 3wt.% Al to improve the indentation hardness and corrosion properties. Microindentation tests with two different indenters, namely, a three-sided pyramidal Berkovich indenter and a ball indenter were performed to study the mechanical response, the indentation hardness and elastic modulus of the coatings in conditions: as-plated, and post treated (PT) at 350°C and 700°C for 1h. The deformation morphology underneath the indenters was examined using a scanning laser microscope. The results showed that Ni–P coatings could significantly enhance the surface hardness of the TWIP steel. Significant improvement in the corrosion resistance could be observed in a sulfuric acid solution for the Ni–P coated steel compared to the uncoated substrate TWIP steel.High-Mn austenitic steels have been the subject of renewed interest due to their unique mechanical properties arising out of transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) and/or twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) effects It is well known that the surface property of materials play a crucial role in meeting various of industrial requirements, such as corrosion resistance, hardness and wear resistance. Microindentation testing is based on the analysis of the indentation load–displacement curves, the response of the material depending on the geometry of indenter Electroless nickel coatings are widely utilized to modify the surface property of the substrate material, such as electrochemical behavior and hardness Hamada et al In the present study, we report the hardening and recovery behavior in a Ni–P coating, obtained by the electroless deposition technique. Two post-heat treatments at different temperatures were also used to obtain different surface properties. Additionally, the deformation behavior and the morphology underneath the indenter were studied. Finally, corrosion studies have also been conducted on these deposits and the TWIP steel in 0.1 Hot rolled high-Mn TWIP steel plates with a thickness of 2 The crystal structures of the deposits have been studied by employing X-ray diffraction with Cu- The adhesion of coatings was measured by applying the Peel test, in which a 0.05 Since the electroless Ni–P plating is a chemical reduction process, the deposited Ni–P coating had an average uniform thickness ∼20  In the present work, the glow discharge–optical emission spectrometry (GD–OES) was applied for compositional distribution study within the coating, wherein, the determination of the compositional distribution of a thin film with the distance from the substrate is carried out by analyzing the sputtered matter as a function of the sputtering time  It well known that, during tension, the elastic modulus Thus, it is clear from the above equations that to calculate the hardness and elastic modulus from indentation load – penetration depth data, one must have an accurate measurement of the elastic stiffness S and the projected contact area under the load. Accordingly, based on Eqs. It can be observed from The elastic modulus of the raw TWIP steel exhibited a low value of 148 Ball indentation with multi-cycles technique can be used to extract the plastic true stress–strain flow curve for any metallic alloy system up to strain 0.15–0.2 The multi-cycles ball indentation force–penetration depth and loading–unloading curves of the different Ni–P coatings are shown in The indentation imprints of the PT coating at 350 On one hand, As evident from The potentiodynamic polarization curves obtained for the electroless Ni–P coated TWIP steel as well as the raw steel without Ni–P coating, in 0.1  Subsequently, when the Ni–P coating was PT at 350 The most relevant results of the present work concerning the electroless nickel–phosphorus coatings on the current high-Mn TWIP steel and characterization the surface property with amorphous and crystalline structure can be briefly summarized as follows: The post treatments at 350 The indentation tests using Berkovich indenter revealed that the indentation hardness and the elastic modulus of the electroless Ni–P coatings are significantly higher than that the substrate TWIP steel The deformation behaviour of the different Ni–P coatings under the ball indentation depends on the structure of the coating. Whereas, the deformation morphology characterized by the laser microscope exhibited no cracks around and beneath the ball indentations of the as-plated amorphous coat, numerous cracks were generated during the indentation deformation of the PT coating at 350 The electroless nickel–phosphorus film with/without PT annealing significantly improved the corrosion resistance in 0.1 The authors would like to thank Y.
