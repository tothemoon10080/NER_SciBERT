In a prospective study of 210 tibial shaft fractures, the accident mechanisms and the resultant fracture morphologies were analyzed.
                  86 fractures occurred due to indirect impact. The fracture morphology in this group consisted of short and long spiral fractures resulting from rotational injuries complicated by anterior torsion butterfly fragments if the person fell forward, posterior torsion butterfly fragments if they fell backwards and complicated by multiple torsion butterfly fragments if it was a high velocity injury.
                  124 fractures occurred due to direct impact. The fracture morphology in this group consisted of transverse, oblique segmental or crush fractures, complicated by one or more butterfly fragments due to bending, the injury depending on whether it was pure, one-point, three-point, or four-point-bending and on additional axial loading and velocity.
                  In the indirect impact group, there were a few soft tissue injuries and fibular fractures at a different level to the tibial fracture. In the direct group, a large number of soft tissue injuries and fibular fractures at the level of impact were found.
