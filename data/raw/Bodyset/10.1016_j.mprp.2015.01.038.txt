 A European strategic partnership including materials specialist Sandvik has been granted the 2014 European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) Call for Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) to boost innovation and tackle health and raw materials challenges in Europe. Sandvik is one of the 100+ companies, research institutes and academia that have partnered to create sustainable economic growth from raw materials innovations. The strategic partnership plans to drive a number of initiatives to strengthen education, innovation and research into raw materials. The budget for EIT KiC Raw Materials for the next seven years is estimated to total €2 billion. Progress in sustainable raw materials supply touches Sandvik's entire value chain, from metallurgy to circular business models, extraction, mineral processing and recycling. ‘To give some examples of the benefits from this initiative we can develop more automated mining in extreme conditions which will enable our customers to source sustainable raw materials,’ said Anna Hultin Stigenberg, Principal R&D Expert in Sandvik Coromant and Chair of the International Steering Committee KIC Raw Materials. ‘We can also form cost efficient substitution and recycling processes and pioneering solutions fit for their future needs.’
