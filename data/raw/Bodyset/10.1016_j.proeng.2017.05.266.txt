On the base of mathematical modeling of stress-strain state in underworked layered salt massif the influence of clay bands on the creation of conditions for gas-dynamic phenomena in the process of potash deposits development has been analyzed. During numerical implementation clay bands were simulated by modified Goodman joint elements. The results of modeling of mine technical situations that precede gas outburst are presented for room-and-pillar method and longwall mining.
