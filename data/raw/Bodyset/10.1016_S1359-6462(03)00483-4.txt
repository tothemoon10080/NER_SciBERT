A series of Al–Fe–Mo–Si alloys with and without additions of Ti and Zr for elevated temperature applications have been produced by rapid solidification. These alloys are mainly strengthened by Al12(Fe,Mo)3Si dispersoids, exhibiting superior elevated temperature strengths and better damping capacity than conventional aluminum alloys.In the past twenty years, many elevated temperature aluminum alloys, such as Al–Fe–Ce A series of Al–Fe–Mo–Si alloys with and without additions of Ti and Zr, as shown in X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the powders was performed on a Rigaku D/max 2200-PC automatic diffractor using Cu-K          This difference in damping capacities of I/M 2618 and RS P/M Al–Fe–Mo–Si alloys is related to different contributions of dislocation, boundary or/and interface damping. For I/M 2618-T61, at low temperatures, the damping comes mainly from the moving of dislocations, while at high temperatures, damping comes mainly from the moving of grain boundaries. For Al–Fe–Mo–Si alloys, at low temperatures, the damping comes mainly from the moving of dislocation and prior powder boundaries (PPBs), while at high temperatures, the damping comes mainly from the moving of grain boundaries (α-Al/α-Al), Al  The microstructures of RS P/M Al–Fe–Mo–Si alloys with and without 0.5%Ti and 1.3%Zr, i.e., FMS 0612, FMS 0918, FMS 1224, FMS 0714 and FMS 0917, consist of dispersoids of b.c.c. Al FMS 0612, FMS 0918 and FMS 1224 show similar tensile properties, stress-rupture property, and corrosion resistance as their counterpart Al–Fe–V–Si alloys. Al–Fe–Mo–Si alloys with Ti and Zr, e.g., FMS 0714 and FMS 0917, exhibit higher room temperature strength than that without Ti and Zr, e.g., FMS 0918. All these alloys show superior elevated temperature strengths than conventional aluminum alloys. RS P/M Al–Fe–Mo–Si alloys possess better damping capacity than I/M 2618-T61, especially at temperatures above 100 °C.
