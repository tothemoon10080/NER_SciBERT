A genetic mutation was detected by our clinic in two sisters in a family with low iron levels and mild symptoms. We identified this missense mutation in the FTL gene (c.473T > C; p.Pro158Leu, rs374486686) of the sisters who had weakness symptom and low serum ferritin level. This mutation causes the codon CCG changing into CTG, thus composing an amino acid substitution in which proline 158 is replaced by leucine. The patients with this mutation had unmeasurable serum ferritin levels while other iron parameters’ levels are normal. As a result of this mutation, we demonstrated that ferritin connects iron however it can not store iron.Ferritin is the major intracellular iron storage protein in mammals and plays an essential role in iron homeostasis [ A 19-year-old woman referred to hospital with symptom of fatigue. The patient was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia and iron treatment was started. The hemoglobin level increased to 13.5 g/dL, but ferritin level did not elevate. Therefore, she was referred to the hematology outpatient clinic with low ferritin level. Laboratory studies revealed; hemoglobin level of 12.6 g/dL (N = 11.7–15.5), ferritin level <0.2 ng/mL (N = 11–307), iron level 31 μg/dL (N = 35–145), iron binding capacity 393 μg/dL (N = 228–428), transferrin saturation 8% (N = 20–50), and platelet count was 225 × 10 Therefore, genetic analysis of the patient's family members was performed. A heterozygote change of C to T in position 473 in cDNA of FTL gene was detected in parents and in sister of the patient. A homozygous change of C to T at position 473 in cDNA of FTL gene was detected in the patient's 25 years old sister. She also had fatigue. Laboratory studies revealed; hemoglobin level of 12.3 g/dL (N = 11.7–15.5), ferritin level <0.2 ng/mL (N = 11–307), iron level 28 μg/dL (N = 35–145), iron binding capacity 396 μg/dL (N = 228–428) and transferrin saturation 7% (N = 20–50). 1000 mg intravenous iron treatment was given. However, after 15 days her measured ferritin level was below 0.2 ng/mL. On the contrary her other sister and parents, whose heterozygous mutations were detected, had iron parameters in normal range. Her father’s ferritin level was 105 ng/mL (N = 11–307), her mother’s was 49 ng/mL (N = 11–307) and her sister’s was 106 ng/mL (N = 11–307). Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes using a QIAmapDNA micro Kit (QIAGEN#56304, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All 4 coding exons and the intronic flanking regions of FTL gene (GeneBank NM_0000146.3 and NC_000019.18) were PCR-amplified using 4 specific primer pairs ( PCR was performed in a 25 μL reaction volume containing 20–50 ng of genomic DNA, 2.5 μL of 10XPCR buffer, 0.1 mM of each dNTP, 1 mM of MgCl PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels and bands were visualized with ethidium bromide. Subsequently, DNA sequencing reactions were conducted using the same primer pairs and a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequencing reaction mixtures were electrophoresed and analyzed using an ABI 3730xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and Sequencing results were analysed by ChromasPro version 2.0.0. Serum ferritin levels were measured using chemiluminescence immunoassay, serum iron was measured by colorimetric analysis and serum transferrin was measured by nephelometry. Sequencing of FTL gene in two affected sisters showed a homozygous change of C to T ( A unique missense p.Pro158Leu mutation in the L ferritin subunit was identified in two affected sisters. This unique mutation is associated with non-measurable ferritin levels while other iron parameters are normal. No obvious clinical symptoms were found associated with the presence of the mutation. Ferritin is an iron-storage heteropolymer. Iron, if not immediately used in the cell, is stored in the ferritin. Ferritin is composed of two conformationally equivalent subunit types, light (FTL) and heavy (FTH1) polypeptides, which are expressed in most types of cells [ Previously, different mutations in the FTL gene have been described in the literature. Different mutations are associated with nucleotide insertions in exon 4 of FTL, which result frame shifts and large modifications of the C-terminal [ No symptoms were observed in these patients with the mutation we defined. While other iron parameters and hemoglobin levels were normal, ferritin level was low in two sisters. Most of the patients described in the literature had hereditary hyperferritinopathy that causes hyperferritinemia–cataract syndrome and neurodegeneration in the past. p.Pro158Leu (c.473 C-T) mutation in FTL gene was defined for the first time in the literature with a patient who had no symptoms but non-measurable ferritin level via this case. As a result of this mutation in the FTL gene, we demonstrated that ferritin can connect iron however can not store it. None. Informed consent was obtained from patient included in the study.
