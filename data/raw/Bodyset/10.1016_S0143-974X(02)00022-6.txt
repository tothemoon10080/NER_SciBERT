The failure mechanism of slender girder webs stiffened by a single longitudinal stiffener under patch loading is addressed. Experimental results have shown that failure is due to crippling in the web panel formed between the loaded flange and the stiffener. This mechanism is similar to the one for unstiffened webs, which is characterized by the presence of elastoplastic deformations in the compression flange (plastic hinges) and in the web (yield lines).

Based on the upper bound theorem of plastic collapse an expression for the patch loading resistance of webs stiffened by a single horizontal stiffener is presented. Theoretical predictions are in good agreement with experimental results.length of web panel width of flange width of stiffener position of longitudinal stiffener width of stiffener effective length of the patch load flexural rigidity of unit width of the web plate [= Young’s modulus magnification factor to account for the influence of a longitudinal stiffener yield stress of flange yield stress of web shear modulus [= depth of web panel moment of inertia of stiffener, including a contribution of web plate equal to 30 torsional constant depending on stiffener cross-section mean value plastic moment of flange (= plastic moment per unit length of web (= experimental ultimate load theoretical ultimate patch load for an unstiffened girder theoretical ultimate patch load for a girder with a longitudinal stiffener standard deviation length of patch load flange thickness stiffener thickness web thickness coefficient of variation distance to yield lines in the web ‘spread’ of plastic hinges in loaded flange angle defining deformation of flange prior to collapse vertical displacement of the patch load at the instant of collapse elastic deflection of the patch-loaded flange just prior to collapse relative torsional rigidity of the longitudinal stiffener (= relative flexural rigidity of the longitudinal stiffener (= yielded length of web plate angle defining deformation of web prior to collapse longitudinal stress in the flange due to bending moment Poisson’s ratio Several authors Most of the proposals found in the literature for the consideration of a longitudinal stiffener in the calculation of the patch load resistance of plate girders are semi-empirical   Accordingly, the longitudinal stiffener provides an elastic support with respect to the out-of-plane and vertical displacements of the web. A state-of-the-art review of pertinent experimental studies is given in the first part of this paper. The second part is intended to give a contribution toward the implementation for the design of longitudinal stiffening with regard to patch loading by considering the failure mechanism of plate girders observed in hundreds of experiments carried out at different universities and research centers around the world. Carretero and Lebet Furthermore, Carretero and Lebet compared in The results of this experimental investigation were presented in a series of articles and reports The results showed a significant increase in the ultimate patch load due to the presence of a longitudinal stiffener. Furthermore, it was concluded that the distance where the stiffener has to be placed should be smaller than 40 The tests performed by Bergfelt In this set of experiments the size of the stiffener was the same because its influence was not the aim of the study. Instead the influences of the stiffener position and of the panel aspect ratio ( Bergfelt reported a slight influence of the stiffener in increasing the load bearing capacity of the tested girders. The slenderness ratio of the directly loaded web panel An extensive investigation of the influence of longitudinal stiffeners with open cross-section was performed at the Building Research Institute of the Czech Technical University in Prague According to Kutmanova and Skaloud The results from experimental studies by various authors have been grouped here. Only stiffeners with open cross-section were used in these investigations. Data concerning the plate girders are shown in In Tests 150–151 were made by Salkar It can be assumed that a longitudinal stiffener with a relatively large rigidity has sufficient flexural rigidity to restrict the out-of-plane deflection of the web and for closed stiffeners also enough torsional stiffness to restrict the local rotation of the web. When the stiffener is relatively stiff it is possible that a nodal line (where the curvature changes) forms in the web panel at the stiffener location. If those conditions, mentioned above, of stiffener rigidity are satisfied, a mechanism with four plastic hinges similar to the one suggested by Roberts and Newark  The formulation of the ‘folded web theory’ given as a formula initially proposed by Roberts and Rockey In Minimizing Calculating the elastic deformation, prior to collapse, for the upper flange as a beam of length Substituting An approximative expression for the left-hand-side of Thus, The spread of the plastic hinges in the flange is restricted by the width of the plate girder panel owing to the presence of transverse web stiffeners, therefore After some mathematical manipulation of A shortcoming of this model is that the ultimate load obtained using In the experimental investigations  The accuracy of this prediction depends mainly on the location and flexural rigidity of the longitudinal stiffener. In general, two parameters describe the capacity of a stiffener to resist buckling, namely the relative flexural ( Usually the rigidities of the stiffener are expressed relative to the plate stiffness The moment of inertia The design procedure incorporated in BS 5400 Part 3 The role of the magnification factor In Predicted ultimate loads In comparison, using the design procedure in BS 5400-3:2000 ( In the experimental studies, it was observed that there was little influence of the longitudinal stiffener to increase the ultimate patch loading resistance of the plate girders when the slenderness ratio of the directly loaded panel was larger than 40. It is clearly observed in the experiments carried out by Bergfelt These results are in agreement with ECCS Publ. No.44 In The torsional rigidity of open section stiffeners is often negligible when compared with that of closed section stiffeners. In particular, for closed section stiffeners (trapezoidal or V-shaped) the predictions work well, because such stiffeners satisfy the stiffness requirements set in the development of the mechanism solution, i.e. the longitudinal stiffener has a sufficient flexural rigidity to restrict the out-of-plane deflection of the web and also enough torsional stiffness to restrict the local rotation of the web. On the other hand, for the very weak stiffeners with small  As seen in An ultimate strength model for plate girders with one longitudinal web stiffener was introduced herein based on a modified version of Roberts’ mechanism solution for patch loading. From the ultimate strength analysis conducted it seems that the accuracy in the theoretical predictions improves when the relative flexural rigidity of the stiffener is greater than 35 ( Concerning the effect of the stiffener configuration (open or closed section), the use of torsionally stiff stiffeners (trapezoidal or V-shaped) leads to a substantial increase in stiffener efficiency in relation to its weight. A large torsional rigidity may also reduce the value of the relative flexural rigidity Very few studies have been conducted to determine the optimum rigidity of longitudinal stiffeners for patch loading. The results presented herein point toward the determination of such rigidity on the basis of ultimate strength. Previous analyses regarding the optimum rigidity of longitudinal stiffeners are based on the classical buckling theory, which may be inadequate for plated structures due to their strength reserve in the postbuckling range.
