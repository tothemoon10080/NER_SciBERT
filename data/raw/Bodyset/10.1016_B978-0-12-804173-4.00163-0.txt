The beginning of metallothermic reduction-based studies in Turkey was a result of studies on the carbothermal synthesis of advanced ceramics and ferroalloys at Istanbul Technical University (ITU), Metallurgical Engineering Department in the late 1980s. By the 1990s, the first metallothermic reduction experiments were carried out to develop alternative production routes for ferroalloys, and studies on SHS began by the 2000s in Turkey. Turkish companies use metallothermic reduction processes in all their processes or in some steps of their processes, such as primary magnesium production, production of steel deoxidation agents from Al drosses, and production of low carbon ferrochromium.The beginning of metallothermic reduction-based studies in Turkey was a result of studies on the carbothermal synthesis of advanced ceramics (e.g., B Many SHS studies have been conducted at ITU concerning the SHS of borides and carbides, such as TiB The seventeenth International Symposium on Boron, Borides, and Related Materials (ISBB 2011) was held in September 2011 in Istanbul, Turkey, and one of the symposium sessions was dedicated to SHS [ Turkish companies use metallothermic reduction processes in all their processes or in some steps of their processes, such as primary magnesium production (Eczacıbaşı Esan: 15,000
