Dielectric (ε

                     r′ value is nearly frequency independent over 500Hz≤f<100kHz and T≥30°C. The impedance spectroscopy (IS) study has clearly shown that both, the coarse- and the fine-grained samples consist of semiconducting grains and insulating grain boundaries that primarily lead to an internal barrier layer capacitance (IBLC) effect. And thus, manifest colossal dielectric constant (ε
