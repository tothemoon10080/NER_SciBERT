Nutritional rickets remains a major public health problem in many countries of the world, despite effective and cheap means to prevent and treat the disease. It is most prevalent in the infant/toddler age groups and the adolescent, but vitamin D deficiency is also prevalent in women of child-bearing age, resulting in babies being born with no vitamin D stores and not receiving any vitamin D in breast milk, thus exacerbating the risk for rickets in these infants. In a number of subtropical developing countries, rickets appears to be due to low dietary calcium intakes rather than vitamin D deficiency. Calcium intakes of approximately 200mg/day are characteristic of diets of these children. Biochemically these children are differentiated from those with vitamin D deficiency by having markedly elevated 1,25(OH)2D concentrations and high fractional intestinal calcium absorption. Nutritional rickets represents the outcome of a spectrum of causes, ranging from vitamin D deficiency on the one hand to dietary calcium deficiency on the other, while in between low dietary intakes and vitamin D insufficiency combine to cause the disease.Nutritional rickets remains a major public health problem in many countries of the world, despite effective and cheap means to prevent and treat the disease.

In a number of subtropical developing countries, rickets appears to be due to low dietary calcium intakes rather than vitamin D deficiency. Calcium intakes of approximately 200  Although nutritional rickets is often considered to be a disease of industrialization, descriptions of rickets have been attributed to both Homer (900 BC) and Soranus Ephesius (130 AD). More recently, attention was drawn to rickets by Daniel Whistler in 1645 and five years later Francis Glisson (1650) provided a classic description of the disease. It was described as a disease which occurred in young children, produced severe deformities and was often fatal. The condition, which was known in Europe as “the English disease,” was more common in the cities than in rural areas. Prior to the industrial revolution, it was associated with affluence, as the children of well-to-do families were often completely covered by clothing and were kept indoors. With the migration of large numbers of people from rural to urban areas at the time of the industrial revolution, the disease became associated with poverty and overcrowding in the developing urban slums. A number of studies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries documented the almost universal prevalence of rickets in young children in cities in northern Europe (for example, in Glasgow In the United Kingdom, a number of foods were fortified with vitamin D during the Second World War. This led to a rapid reduction in the number of children diagnosed with rickets, but in the following years the incidence of idiopathic hypercalcemia rose in infants which at the time was thought to be due to uncontrolled fortification of various foods (especially milk and cereals) leading to daily intakes of 100 In the USA, the universal fortification of milk with vitamin D at 400 Over the past 20 years, there has been much discussion and debate concerning the definition of vitamin D deficiency and the best methods for determining vitamin D status. Since the descriptions of the first assays to measure serum concentrations of vitamin D and/or its metabolites in the early 1970s, 25(OH)D has been the metabolite that has been used to define vitamin D status, as its serum concentrations are relatively stable (half-life 2–3 weeks), are not regulated to any great extent except by substrate concentration, and reflect vitamin D intake through the diet and synthesis by the skin Vitamin D deficiency is a prerequisite for the development of nutritional rickets in the majority of children. Thus the disease is typically associated with a lack of ultraviolet light exposure or dietary vitamin D. As commonly ingested foods are generally deficient in vitamin D (the exceptions being oily fishes or fortified foods), the normal diet contributes little to the vitamin D status of an individual, thus adequate skin exposure to ultraviolet radiation is essential for the prevention of rickets in most situations Vitamin D deficiency rickets is most prevalent in children under 2 years of age, with a peak incidence between 3 and 18 months In a number of studies vitamin D deficiency rickets has been noted to occur more commonly in boys than Several recent publications have suggested that polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene might play a role in predisposing infants and children to rickets. (Specific polymorphisms are described in In the early literature, breast-feeding was reported to be protective against rickets In the breast-fed infant not receiving vitamin D supplements, the maintenance of an adequate vitamin D status is dependent mainly on the infant’s exposure to ultraviolet light Seasonal variations in serum 25(OH)D concentrations have also been documented in a number of countries in older children and adults In the USA, despite the almost complete eradication of vitamin D deficiency among Caucasian children, several studies have highlighted the resurgence of the problem in specific groups A similar pattern has also been documented in darker-skinned immigrant populations in a number of European countries The majority of clinical signs in children with rickets results from the effects of vitamin D deficiency on the mineralization process at the growth plate or on calcium homeostasis. Fraser and coworkers The early clinical manifestations of vitamin D deficiency (stage I) are related to hypocalcemia and are more commonly seen in young infants (less than 6 months of age). They may present with convulsions As the deficiency progresses, the classical features of rickets become apparent. Typically the infant or young child presents with a delay in motor milestones, hypotonia, and progressive deformities of the long bones. The deformities are most noticeable at the distal forearm with enlargement of the wrist and bowing of the distal radius and ulna, and in the legs with progressive lateral bowing of the femur and tibia. The sites and types of deformity are dependent on the age of the child and the weight-bearing patterns in the limbs. Thus in the small infant deformities of the forearms and anterior bowing of the distal tibias are more common, while in the toddler who has started to walk an exaggeration of the normal physiological bowing of the legs (genu varum) is characteristic. In the older child valgus deformities of the legs or a windswept deformity (valgus deformity of one leg and varus deformity of the other) Other skeletal abnormalities include a delay in the closure of the fontanelles, parietal and frontal bossing (hot-cross bun appearance) and the presence of craniotabes A delay in tooth eruption is a feature of rickets in the young child and enamel hypoplasia of teeth may occur if rickets develops prior to the completion of enamel deposition. The latter has been reported in the primary dentition of infants born to mothers who are vitamin D deficient Hypotonia, decreased activity and a protuberant abdomen are characteristic features of advanced vitamin D deficiency rickets in the infant and young child. These signs are probably analogous to the proximal muscle weakness described in vitamin-D-deficient adolescents and adults Dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiac failure Infants and young children with rickets are prone to an increased number and severity of infections A possibly associated abnormality is anemia, thrombocytopenia, leucocytosis, myelocytosis, erythroblastosis, myelofibrosis The hallmark of vitamin D deficiency is a low circulating level of 25(OH)D. In healthy children, a range of approximately 12 to 50 The classical biochemical changes in vitamin-D-deficient children who have radiological changes of rickets are a combination of hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone concentrations. In the early phase of vitamin D deficiency before the development of radiological signs (stage I), hypocalcemia may be the only biochemical abnormality The elegant studies conducted by Fraser and coworkers Evidence of end-organ resistance to PTH has been found in the young children with both mild and more severe radiological rickets Markers of bone turnover are typically elevated in nutritional rickets in response to the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Urinary hydroxyproline excretion may be within the normal range in stage I rickets, but is elevated in patients with radiologic rickets Osteocalcin is a non-collagenous bone matrix protein that binds to hydroxyapatite and is secreted by osteoblasts during mineralization In patients with vitamin D deficiency, serum 1,25(OH) A possible pathophysiological progression of vitamin D deficiency rickets in children may be described as follows It is during stage II that serum 1,25(OH) As 25(OH)D concentrations fall further, 1,25(OH) The typical radiologic changes associated with vitamin D deficiency rickets have been well described and are discussed in The early signs of rickets include widening of the epiphyseal plates and a loss of definition of the provisional zone of calcification at the metaphyses The shafts of the long bones show features of both hyperparathyroidism and osteomalacia. Osteopenia is a characteristic feature which in the so-called “atrophic” form of the disease may be very severe Enlargement and splaying of the costochondral junctions on the lateral radiographs of the chest have been used as a sign of rickets; however, in one study mild changes were found to be unreliable as their presence did not correlate with serum 25(OH)D concentrations or with other features of rickets at the distal radius and ulna Rickets during adolescence may be difficult to detect using the conventional radiographic sites of the wrist and knees as the epiphyseal plates narrow and epiphyses fuse. A radiograph of the pelvis may be useful in this situation as the secondary iliac and ischial ossification centers may be abnormally wide The sign of early healing of rickets is described as the appearance of broadened bands of increased density replacing the normal sharp metaphyseal lines ( The characteristic feature in all forms of rickets is the abnormality that occurs at the growth plate. The cartilaginous plate consists of resting, proliferating and hypertrophic zones of chondrocytes, and in rickets it is the hypertrophic zone that is affected through widening and loss of organization of this zone. The widening is caused by marked impairment of apoptosis of the hypertrophied cells through an inhibition of the caspase-9-mediated mitochondrial pathway Vitamin D deficiency rickets can be effectively treated by the oral administration of small doses of either vitamin D More generally, however, doses of vitamin D between 5000 and 15 A recent randomized clinical trial found that daily vitamin D In Central Europe, a single dose of 600 Besides ensuring an adequate vitamin D intake, the calcium content of the diet should be optimized (between 600 and 1000 As discussed in “The epidemiology of vitamin D deficiency and nutritional rickets,” above, vitamin D deficiency rickets remains a problem in a number of at-risk groups despite readily available methods of preventing the disease. A number of studies in several Thus, preventive strategies should be directed not only at breast-fed infants but also at pregnant and breast-feeding women and adolescents where appropriate North America and the UK recommend dietary intakes of between 350 and 400 Infants fed milk formulas or cow’s milk fortified with vitamin D do not require vitamin D supplements, as their intake of milk generally provides sufficient vitamin D to prevent deficiency As discussed earlier, high single-dose therapy (stosstherapie) has been used with success in the treatment of vitamin D deficiency rickets in a number of countries. A similar dose has also been used on a regular intermittent basis of every 3 to 5 months for the first 18 months of life as a means of prevention of vitamin D deficiency. Little data are available on the efficacy of such prophylaxis. However, in a study to assess the effect of these high doses of vitamin D (600 Following on these results, a study to assess the efficacy of a single dose of vitamin D (600 The same group of researchers has also studied the use of intermittent vitamin D supplementation to prevent vitamin D deficiency during the winter months in adolescents in northern France Vitamin D supplementation should be considered for all breast-fed infants living in temperate climates until they are ambulatory and are able to play outside In a number of countries, vitamin D deficiency is not just a disease of breast-fed infants and their mothers. Rickets has been described in adolescents of Indian and Pakistani descent in the UK and in the Middle East Besides the high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D among groups of adolescents, there is an increasing awareness of the high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in many elderly subjects in Europe and North America Although the untargeted fortification of foods other than milk and infant milk formulas has been used in the past as a means of addressing the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in countries where the risk of vitamin D deficiency is high, the problems experienced in the UK after the Second World War have led to it falling into disfavor (cf. “Historical perspective,” above). More recently, the use of targeted food fortification has been studied in the Asian community in Great Britain as a means of reducing the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in both adults and children in that community Conventional wisdom would have it that nutritional rickets is primarily due to vitamin D deficiency, although dietary calcium intake modulates the severity and rapidity of onset of the disease Isolated case reports of rickets developing in infants and toddlers, who were placed on very low calcium diets, have been published More convincing evidence of dietary calcium deficiency as a cause for rickets in children comes from studies in South Africa In South Africa, the children typically come from rural areas and present with signs and symptoms of rickets between the ages of 4 and 15 years Radiologically, the features are typical of calciopenic rickets with osteopenia and features of hyperparathyroidism being frequent findings ( The biochemical features are similar to those of other causes of calciopenic rickets. Hypocalcemia, low urinary calcium excretion and elevated serum PTH and alkaline phosphatase concentrations are characteristic, while serum phosphorus values are variable and often within the reference range for age Iliac crest bone biopsies reveal evidence of osteomalacia and hyperparathyroidism in those children who have radiologic features of rickets In both the Nigerian and South African studies, clinical, biochemical and radiologic healing has been achieved through increasing the calcium intake of the children to between 800 and 1500 The data available from epidemiologic studies conducted in a rural area in South Africa in which a number of the affected children live suggest that asymptomatic dietary calcium deficiency is prevalent in school children living in the area. Some 13% of children between the ages of 7 and 12 years were hypocalcemic, 41.5% had elevated alkaline phosphatase concentrations and 76% had low urinary calcium excretion Although dietary calcium intakes in children with biochemical changes suggestive of dietary calcium deficiency are very low, it is unclear what role the high phytate or oxalate contents of the diet play in aggravating the symptoms. Nevertheless, biochemical improvement can be achieved by supplementing the children with 500 Nutritional rickets has been viewed for some time as being due to an inadequate supply of vitamin D through either an inadequate dietary intake or insufficient skin exposure to ultraviolet radiation, or more recently due to low dietary calcium intake in the face of a normal vitamin D status. However, these pathogenetic concepts are too simplistic. Early studies by Mellanby The resurgence of rickets and osteomalacia in the Asian community in Great Britain provided the impetus for detailed studies into the pathogenesis of vitamin D deficiency and bone disease in that community. Although vitamin D deficiency as assessed by circulating 25(OH)D concentrations is the hallmark of the disease in Asians Over the past 25 years, research has shown that both high-fiber diets and intestinal malabsorption reduce the serum half-life of 25(OH)D by approximately one-third In the light of the above studies, Clements Thus nutritional rickets has a spectrum of pathogenetic mechanisms ranging from pure vitamin D deficiency associated with adequate calcium intakes, as might occur in the breast-fed infant, at one end of the spectrum, to pure dietary calcium deficiency with an adequate vitamin D status, as documented in Nigerian and South African rural children, at the other end A number of recent studies have highlighted the complex interaction between vitamin D and calcium intakes in the pathogenesis of nutritional rickets in children. A review of 43 patients diagnosed as having nutritional rickets in New Haven, Connecticut, found low 25(OH)D levels in only 22%, and the majority of infants had been weaned onto diets with minimal dairy content Despite readily accessible and effective means to eradicate rickets globally, the disease remains a major public health problem in many countries, not only in temperate regions of the world but also in tropical and subtropical countries. In many developed countries, the promotion of exclusive breast-feeding during the first 6 months of life and the concerns about the long-term effect of sunlight exposure during this period have exacerbated the risks of vitamin D deficiency in the young infant. In some subtropical countries, social customs play an important role in preventing adequate vitamin D status not only in the young infant but also in the pregnant and lactating mother. In a number of developing countries, low dietary calcium intakes appear to play a major role in the pathogenesis of rickets in older children. Recent studies have helped to provide an all-embracing concept of the interaction of vitamin D and calcium intakes in the pathogenesis of rickets. There remains a need for international agencies to place the eradication of vitamin D deficiency among young children in many parts of the world as a priority. Nutritional rickets not only leads to an increased infant mortality but also has long-term sequelae.
