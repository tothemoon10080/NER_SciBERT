This chapter presents the rationale for establishing tooth contact patterns during fixed prosthodontic procedures, that is, for establishing a therapeutic occlusal form.
               In the absence of scientific data, various “philosophies of occlusion” have evolved in an effort to describe the relationship that should be developed between the teeth during restorative procedures or adjustment of the natural dentition. With little evidence these philosophies or concepts often involve complicated and expensive instrumentation and are promoted with almost religious zeal rather than scientific rigor. These philosophies have also been applied to implant-supported prostheses—with little scientific data to verify their effectiveness.
               Form that supports function is the rationale for the occlusal form outlined in this chapter. Evidence for its effectiveness is provided by the outcomes—biological, physiological, and mechanical—of up to 15 years of longitudinal assessment of fixed metal-ceramic dental prostheses and up to 25 years of longitudinal assessment of metal-ceramic single unit crowns.
               There is a need for further long-term studies evaluating the outcome of fixed prosthodontics. It is accepted that prospective, randomized clinical trials with adequate controls and well-defined criteria are very difficult to carry out. In addition, clinical studies of less than 5 years have little relevance (Creugers et al. 1994) and can lead to incorrect conclusions (Walton 2002). It is therefore imperative that clinicians document and publish information from their clinical practice. The resultant collective data would facilitate a more evidence-based approach to procedures used in fixed prosthodontics.
