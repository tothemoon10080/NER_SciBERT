The effect of the Te for Se substitution in the Fe7Se8 compound having a layered NiAs-type structure has been studied by means of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, thermal expansion, electrical resistivity and magnetization measurements.

It has been observed that the crystal structure and composition of the hexagonal Fe7(Se,Te)8 phase (P63/mmc) transforms with increasing Te content to the CdI2-type phase (
