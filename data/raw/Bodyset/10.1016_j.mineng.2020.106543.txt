From the development of a semi-autogenous grinding model based on effective grinding rates and internal classification presented during the nineties (Magne et al., 1995) the state of the art of the mathematical structure of this model was updated, presenting the development of each subprocess from the inside of the mill in detail, considering grinding, internal classification, and mass transport. The developed model was used to demonstrate its predictive capacity using results from SAG pilot tests on copper ores. After applying the model, the ability to replicate the results obtained for size distributions of internal load, product, and the total filling level was demonstrated. This article presents, from a simplified approach and strongly based on the observation of the experimental data obtained at pilot scale, the first approach and details of how to use the model, being an alternative to the current state of the art.In 1995, Magne ( From the mathematical modeling point of view and based on the mentioned approach, Magne ( The fact that size reduction processes are grouped in a single K The methodology analysis involves the estimate of process parameters, K For the case of internal classification efficiency c Considering previous relationships and steady-state, equation For K  The estimate of internal classification efficiency requires knowledge of fictitious flow that faces the grate (P*) and its distribution by sizes (p Replacing the previous expression in equation The previous expression shows that the p Based on the information associated to the mass transport of fine material (for example, ore below 100 μm) at the internal load and of the final product, it is possible to assume that the flow of fine material is identical in ratio in internal load, fictitious flow P* and at the final product, therefore: The representation of size reduction processes in this model is made through the function K Based on the empirical evidence, when applying this model using information from SAG grinding tests at the pilot and laboratory scale, the shape of the internal classification efficiency curve indicated the presence of more than one isolated classification process and represented only by the discharge grate. Considering the scheme presented in Where: For the classification vectors c Mass transport phenomena inside the mill are represented in a simplified form through the estimate of fictitious flow P* and P*/W ratio. Given the calculation format, the fictitious flow P* is mostly determined by the transport of fine material inside the mill and by the internal load obtained under certain defined operational conditions. Water mass variation inside the mill is represented by a first-order differential equation based on the results obtained at pilot scale ( Parameter C Based on tests carried out at a pilot SAG mill of 1,82 × 0,61 m, the results obtained for different types of copper ore were assessed. Operating conditions under which tests were performed were similar for all cases, and they are summarized in Once the steady-state reached, determined by the stability of the product flow stream (in balance with the fresh feed) and the percent solids of this (measured through circuit sampling), five  On each test, a normalized specific energy consumption (SECn) estimated was included, which is defined as the specific energy consumption needed to perform a size reduction from a size F Normalized specific energy consumption, SECn, shows a good correlation with the AxB parameter obtained in each pilot test from an SMC test based on the R Based on ore hardness values, empirical relationships were developed to determine each parameter of the model that is presented as an exercise to demonstrate the mathematical capability of the model to predict the process for this set of tests. In the author’s opinion, any model developed to predict process performance should be linked with the current geometallurgical information generated at the industrial scale, providing a broader use of these kinds of models. Using the equations obtained as such, each model parameter was re-estimated, determining function K  Using information from fifty-eight (58) pilot test, developed with different kinds of ores and operational conditions, the model was tested used to predict, first K For the internal load sizes distribution, it was selected five (5) sizes and the pass cumulative for each one to make the comparison. The sizes were 106, 425, 1700, 12700, and 50,700 µm. For each of these tests, it was used the same methodology to predict the specific effective grinding rates and the internal classification. Taking the internal load and product size distributions, the K Considering a phenomenological approach, a SAG grinding model based on the effective grinding rate and the internal three-stages classification concept was presented, derived based on the observation of the results of pilot-scale tests. The model on results obtained at pilot scale tests carried out with Copper ore was applied. The capacity to reproduce the internal load size distribution, product size distribution and the total filling level of the model presented was detailed assessed based on the analysis performed over The purpose of this article has been to present the ability of the proposed model to replicate the performance of the SAG mill process at pilot scale in terms of product and internal load distribution, in addition to the total filling level.
