Thin films of undoped and 0.1wt.% Ca-doped SnO2 with 30–60Å Pt layers deposited by ion beam sputtering have been structured on Si substrates. CH4 sensitivities for those Pt-covered undoped and Ca-doped SnO2 sensors are compared in terms of root-mean-square surface roughnesses measured by the scanning probe microscopy in the AFM mode. There is an optimal Pt thickness of 45Å for maximum CH4 sensitivity. Pt catalysts lead to increase in methane sensitivity for the undoped sensor. However, coating of a Pt catalyst layer on the Ca-doped SnO2 results in an inverse effect on CH4 sensitivity. All the fabricated sensors exhibited relatively small humidity dependencies and excellent long-term stabilities for 90 days.Methane is the most stable gas among various hydrocarbon gases. Thus, it is very difficult to develop a long-term stable methane gas sensor because it should operate at a high sensor temperature. Long-term stability might be achieved by stabilizing SnO Significant advantages of ion beam sputtering We Target materials were synthesized by sintering undoped and Ca-doped SnO The 5000 Gas sensitivities were measured mostly at around 30% of relative humidity (RH) calculated at 25 Addition of small amounts of noble metals such as Pd, Ag, and Pt to SnO  The humidity dependencies of the sensitivity to 5000 Thin films of undoped and 0.1 This research was supported by Yeungnam University research grant in 2004.
