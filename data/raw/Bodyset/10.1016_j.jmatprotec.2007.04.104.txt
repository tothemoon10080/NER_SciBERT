                  Reason: The authors have plagiarized part of a paper that had already appeared in Effect of natural aging on the resistivity evolution during artificial aging of the aluminum alloy AA6111, S. Esmaeili, D.J. Lloyd, W.J. Poole, Mater. Lett., 59 (2005) 575â€“577, doi:10.1016/j.matlet.2004.10.052. One of the conditions of submission of a paper for publication is that authors declare explicitly that their work is original and has not appeared in a publication elsewhere. Re-use of any data should be appropriately cited. As such this article represents a severe abuse of the scientific publishing system. The scientific community takes a very strong view on this matter and we apologize to readers of the journal that this was not detected during the submission process.
