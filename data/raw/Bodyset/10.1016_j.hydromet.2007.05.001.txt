The phase equilibrium of the HCl–LiCl–MgCl2–H2O system was simulated over a wide range of temperature and concentration by using an extended BET model. The experimental solubility and water activity in the binary HCl–H2O, LiCl–H2O, MgCl2–H2O and ternary HCl–LiCl–H2O, HCl–MgCl2–H2O and LiCl–MgCl2–H2O systems were used to obtain the model parameters. Then the solubility isotherms in the quaternary HCl–LiCl–MgCl2–H2O system were predicted and compared with the available experimental data. It was shown that the extended BET model with few model parameters can perfectly predict the solubility of the highly soluble quaternary HCl–LiCl–MgCl2–H2O system over a wide temperature range from 273 K to 413 K. The predicted phase diagram proved to be trustworthy and reliable for the industrial process design of separating MgCl2 from LiCl-containing natural brine using HCl as a salting-out agent.The phase equilibrium of the HCl–LiCl–MgCl The theoretical models to compute the phase equilibrium of the quaternary system have been developed over years. Li et al. calculated the solubilities in the ternary HCl–LiCl–H In previous papers (  In this work, an extended BET model was used for the computation of the phase diagram for the quaternary HCl–LiCl–MgCl According to where Taking the non-ideality of mixing among the salts MX Differentiating Eq. The model parameter The model parameter To calculate the phase diagram in ternary and quaternary systems, the chemical potential of each solid phase should be determined in advance, which can be obtained by calculating the component activity of the saturated solution in equilibrium with the solid phase MX The chemical potential of the solid MX The chemical potential of MX The solubility product   The binary BET parameters for the MgCl In the volatile HCl All the binary parameters are listed in With the above binary BET parameters, the water activity and solubility isotherms in ternary LiCl–MgCl As discussed previously ( As shown in With only binary model parameters, the BET model can approximately predict the isotherms of the system HCl–MgCl In summary, the BET model can approximately predict the solubility properties in ternary systems with only binary BET parameters. By introducing one extra parameter In order to test whether the model parameters obtained from binary and ternary systems perform equally well in the quaternary system, the model was benchmarked against the quaternary HCl–LiCl–MgCl Applying all the parameters shown in Now that the BET model can predict the properties of component activity and solubility in the quaternary HCl–LiCl–MgCl By applying the current BET model, the crystallization behaviour can be predicted as shown in Combining the BET adsorption model for a multi-component system and an extra term for the salt–salt interaction, a new empirical model was proposed in this work to describe the solubility behaviour and component activity in the ternary HCl–LiCl–H Then, the solubility isothermal surface of the quaternary HCl–LiCl–MgCl Finally, an application example was given to predict the crystallization behaviour of a practical salt brine containing 0.92 mol About 4 mol of MgCl Low temperature benefits the salting-out of MgCl If the HCl concentration reaches 8–10 mol  Activity of salt Activity of solvent water Parameter of solubility product Interaction parameter between salt Parameter of solubility product BET model parameter of salt Pitzer model parameter Energy of solvent water adsorbed onto salt Energy of solvent water in pure water state Mole number of solvent water (mol) Solubility product constant of solid phase MX Molality of salt Mole number of component Vapour pressure of water Universal gas constant (8.314 J BET model parameter for salt Temperature coefficients of BET model parameter Absolute temperature (K) Mole number of solvent water adsorbed onto salt Dry mole fraction of salt Pitzer model parameters Gibbs energy of mixing BET model parameter for salt Temperature coefficients of BET model parameter Chemical potential of solid phase MX Chemical potential of salt MX in pure hypothetical undercooled molten state  Aqueous solution Solid phase  Standard state The West Mining Co., Ltd, P.R.
