   Comminution in hammer mills to approximately 2-mm pieces. Cooking to 110–120 Pressing in a screw press at high pressure to yield crude palm kernel oil and a meal containing 7–9% oil. The meal is used for animal feed.           Palm kernel oil forms a eutectic with palm oil in a mixture containing about 30% palm kernel oil. This feature is used to improve the mouth feel (rapid melting) in the following formula: Palm kernel olein (30 parts) interesterified with palm stearin (70 parts) forms a margarine stock. To make margarine, 60 parts are blended with 40 parts liquid oil. Equal quantities of fully hydrogenated palm kernel oil and fully hydrogenated palm oil are interesterified. A margarine high in polyunsaturated fatty acids is made by blending 12% of this hard stock with 88% of a liquid oil such as sunflower oil.
