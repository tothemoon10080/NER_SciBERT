Aiming at the problems that the stackers used in hillside dumps are inefficient because of the frequent system shifting, we propose a new semi-continuous mining system that replaces the traditional belt conveyor – stacker compounding by belt conveyor – transfer station – truck compounding in this paper. The flexibility advantage of shovel – truck system can be given full play and the transport capacity and low cost of long range transport characteristic can be used in the new system, so it can be used in the surface mines that the overburden transportation distance is long and the landform of hillside dump is complex. The economic efficiency and the minimum transportation distance of the new semi-continuous mining system are analyszed. The Long Qiao Dumping Area of Bu Zhaoba lignite mine is taken as a case study. The cost of shovel – truck system is too high because the transport distance of overburden exceeds 6 km; as a result of small quantity of dumping bench, there are several problems such as the system shifts frequently and it is difficult to mix up dumping overburdens when using stacker to dump the marlite. So the new semi-continuous mining system used in Bu Zhaoba lignite mine is feasible and essential.
