The physical and mechanical properties of rock can be measured by a variety of standard tests and studies have shown that there should be a fundamental connection between breakage in comminution and rock ‘strength’. The current study aims to develop the ring-loaded strength test, used as an industry standard for the characterisation of brittle ceramics, for determination of comminution behaviour from exploration borehole core samples.
                  Preliminary studies using model materials (well defined Cornish granites, Italian marble, fused silica glass, soda-lime-silica glass) have demonstrated the reproducibility of data from the basic test method, and these studies have been extended to testing of core samples from South Crofty and Geevor mines. The tests have also been used on core samples subjected to heat treatments to determine the effects of such pre-treatments on rock strength and to correlate the data with grindability index measures or specific comminution energy.
