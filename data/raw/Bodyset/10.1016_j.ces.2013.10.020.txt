The uranium extraction kinetics with Di-2-Ethyl Hexyl Phosphoric Acid-Tri Butyl Phosphate (D2EHPA–TBP) and Di-2-Ethyl Hexyl Phosphoric Acid-Tri Octyl Phosphine Oxide (D2EHPA–TOPO) dissolved in dodecane has been investigated. The objective of the present study was to identify the reaction location, reaction regime, reaction orders with respect to the reactants and the intrinsic rate constant of the reaction. Experiments were carried out in a constant interfacial area stirred cell and the parameters were varied over a range of 1<impeller speed<1.5r/s, 0<temperature<50°C, concentration of reactants, 3.12×10−4<V

The overall rate is controlled by both the intrinsic kinetics and the mass transfer of the species involved. The overall rate of the reaction is given by the following equation:

                     A systematic procedure has been developed for the estimation of intrinsic kinetics and the mass transfer coefficients.Liquid–liquid extractions find wide applications in industries such as refineries, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, other specialty chemicals, hydrometallurgy, nuclear science and technology, recovery of valuables from waste water, etc. It also has many analytical applications. In commercial practice, a large number of extraction equipments are in operation. These are either stirred type (mixer settler, RDC, Kuhni Column, annular centrifugal extractor, etc.) or unstirred column type (for instance, spray column, packed column, plate column, etc.). For the rational design of any of these equipments, we need to know the mass transfer characteristics, intrinsic kinetics and the extent of axial mixing. Phosphoric acid manufactured from rock phosphate is used in large quantities in the fertilizer industries. It is a vital input for meeting the requirements of increased food grain production, essential to feed the growing population. This phosphoric acid is also an important secondary source of uranium. Recovery of uranium from this acid is a by-product of well established and stable fertilizer industry. Uranium recovery from this secondary source is relatively easy and eco friendly compared to the conventional source like mined ore. Uranium recovery from the secondary source becomes economical as it is equivalent to an ore, which is extracted, digested and filtered, ready for processing operations of concentrations and purification. The production costs are low and in long run only the direct operating costs are involved. There is even more important consideration for the removal of uranium from phosphoric acid. Uranium contained in the phosphates is an energy source. If not recovered from the phosphoric acid, it is lost irretrievably with the fertilizers and is spread on agricultural lands. Apart from this, it is also an environmental concern due to radioactive hazards involved. It is imperative therefore, that uranium separation from phosphates is carried out. During the past 50 years, equilibrium aspects of the uranium extraction processes have been studied in detail. The kinetic aspects of uranium extraction process have not been determined completely. The available literature on extraction kinetics of uranium from nitric acid or phosphoric acid is summarized in     From the foregoing discussion, it is clear that substantial work is needed for developing clear mechanism and kinetics of extraction and stripping. Efforts are needed for establishing the location of reaction by changing the phase ratios and their respective volumes. The concentration and temperature ranges also need to be widened. Therefore, it was thought desirable to undertake a systematic investigation of uranium separation from phosphoric acid by D2EHPA–TBP and D2EHPA–TOPO by liquid–liquid extraction. This manuscript is concerned with (a) identification of the phase in which the reaction occurs (b) determination of the rate controlling step (c) estimation of overall rate of reaction and (d) estimation of intrinsic kinetics and the mass transfer coefficients. The constant interfacial area stirred cell was described by Weak Phosphoric Acid (WPA) was obtained from Heavy Water Board, India. The concentration of Uranium in WPA was found in the range of 50–150 The concentration of uranium in the aqueous phase (WPA) was in the range of 2×10 All the experiments were carried out two times. The average value for each set of experiments is reported in the manuscript. One such data set is shown in Extraction experiments were carried out using different initial concentrations of uranium in the aqueous phase. Extraction experiments were carried out using different initial concentrations of D2EHPA (extractant) in the organic phase. It was varied over a range from 0.8 to 2.0 Initial concentration of co-solvent in the organic phase was varied over a wide range and the extraction experiments were carried out to check its effect. For D2EHPA–TBP system, TBP concentration was varied from 0.11 to 0.37 In the extraction processes, acidity in the aqueous phase plays an important role. In the present study, initial acidity in the aqueous phase was varied over a range from 2 to 11 The contribution of diffusional resistance can easily be found by checking the effect of impeller speed on the rate of reaction. In the present study, the impeller speed was varied over a range 1–1.5 Effect of interfacial area on the reaction rate is also an important parameter in order to comment on the contribution of diffusional resistance in the extraction kinetics. In the present study, the interfacial area was varied over a wide range from 13.62 to 40.85 Effect of aqueous phase volume on the reaction rate gives the evidence about the bulk chemical reaction as the controlling step. The aqueous phase volume was varied over a range from 3.12×10 Temperature contributes to both the intrinsic kinetics and mass transfer although its effect is more pronounced in the former than the later. Variation in the temperature can provide vital information regarding the controlling mechanisms between them. The temperature was varied over a range from 273 to 323 It is very important to collect thermodynamic data in the form of phase equilibria before interpretation of the rate controlling step and the intrinsic kinetics of the system. The values of partition coefficient were determined by varying the concentration of all the components individually and measuring the concentrations at equilibrium for both D2EHPA–TBP and D2EHPA–TOPO systems. Consider the following reaction: The experimental data was fitted in Microsoft excel solver and presented by the following equation: Phase equilibration without extractant and co-solvent indicated no change in the aqueous phase uranium concentration. This is evident of the fact that the uranium concentration in the organic phase is zero and it gets transferred to the organic phase only after chemical reaction with extractant and co-solvent. Therefore, the reaction can be considered to occur either in the aqueous phase or at the interface. Moreover, the rate of reaction was found to be directly dependent on the effective interfacial area which indicates a possibility of an interfacial reaction. Aqueous phase reaction was assumed first and all the regimes were tested for aqueous phase reaction mechanism. Impeller speed dependency was checked to find the contribution of mass transfer to the overall kinetics of the extraction. For mass transfer (of In view of the above observations, the possibility of rate controlling step to be an instantaneous reaction between [ The reversible extraction reaction is shown below Now, It is assumed that H From the mass balance we can write When both mass transfer and interface chemical reaction are controlling, the interfacial concentrations given by Eqs. On simplification and rearrangement The extraction of uranium in D2EHPA–TBP and D2EHPA–TOPO systems was found to be an interfacial reaction. The overall rate is controlled by both the intrinsic kinetics and the mass transfer of the species involved. The overall rate of the reaction is given by the following equation:  reactant in the organic phase (extractant) co-solvent (adduct former) reactant in the aqueous phase (metal ion) complex diffusivity of diffusivity of diffusivity of diffusivity of proton (m diffusivity of product (m proton (acidity) reaction rate constant mass transfer coefficient (m distribution coefficient equilibrium constant interfacial equilibrium constant order of the reaction with respect to the solute ratio of order of the reaction with respect to the reactant order of the reaction with respect to the proton order of the reaction with respect to the co-solvent specific rate of reaction (kmol molar rate of reaction (kmol volumetric rate of reaction (kmol cross sectional area (m time (s) phase volume stoichiometric coefficient with respect to extractant stoichiometric coefficient with respect to co-solvent stoichiometric coefficient with respect to acid stoichiometric coefficient  difference between initial and equilibrium uranium concentration overall kinetic constant equilibrium uranium concentration liquid film  aqueous phase backward reaction forward reaction interfacial value organic phase
