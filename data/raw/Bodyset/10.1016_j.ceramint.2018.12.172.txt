Phase equilibria of the binary PbO-ZnO and ternary PbO-ZnO-SiO2 systems have been experimentally investigated at 1033–1898 K (760–1625 °C) for oxide liquid in equilibrium with air and solid oxide phases: tridymite or cristobalite (SiO2), willemite (Zn2SiO4), zincite (ZnO), larsenite (PbZnSiO4) and lead-zinc melilite (Pb2ZnSi2O7) covering the ranges of concentrations not studied before. High-temperature equilibration on primary phase or inert metal (platinum) substrates, followed by quenching and direct measurement of the Pb, Zn and Si concentrations in the phases with the electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA) has been used. Liquidus phase equilibrium data is essential for the development of the thermodynamic model.The present study of the PbO-ZnO-SiO The studies available in literature are reviewed in the previous assessment by Jak A literature review and an extensive experimental study of solid-liquid phase equilibria of the PbO-ZnO-SiO The previous experimental study The dataset The experimental procedure and apparatus have been described in detail in previous publications by PYROSEARCH The initial compositions of the mixtures were selected so that one or more crystalline phases would be present in equilibrium with liquid slag. The volume fraction of solids in the final phase assemblage was targeted to be below 50%, to achieve the best quenching. Three types of substrates were used for equilibration, depending on the conditions: Pt foil envelopes or wires (>99.9% purity, 0.05 mm thickness, provided by Johnson Matthew, Australia) were used for the PbO-ZnO samples at 1143–1573 K (870–1300 °C), and for the PbO-ZnO-SiO Au foil envelopes (99.99% purity, 0.127 mm thickness, provided by Sigma Aldrich, Australia) were used for the PbO-ZnO-SiO SiO An additional measure to reduce the evaporation of PbO from the samples and to achieve sample homogeneity was preparation of the PbO-SiO The technique of equilibration experiments, quenching, sample preparation, and electron probe X-ray microanalysis (JEOL 8200 L EPMA; Japan Electron Optics Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) is similar to described before The sample was suspended in the hot zone of the furnace on a Kanthal wire (0.7 or 1-mm diameter, for T < 1753 K (1480 °C)) or platinum-rhodium wire (0.5-mm diameter, for T > 1753 K (1480 °C)). The temperature was controlled using R-type thermocouple (Pt-Pt-13%Rh) with overall uncertainty within 5 K. Samples were pre-melted for short time (15–60 min, see Quartz (SiO that typically reduced the SiO Special experiments undertaken in the present study with the 50–200 µm size grains of quartz pressed together with ZnO powder at room temperature (unreacted couple) identified that apparent 0.82 mol.% ZnO is observed due to the secondary X-ray fluorescence in pure quartz grains surrounded by ZnO. The following correction for the secondary X-ray fluorescence therefore has been developed and applied in the present study to the compositions of tridymite and cristobalite measured by EPMA: The composition ranges of solid phases observed in the present study as well as in Examples of micrographs of the quenched PbO-ZnO-SiO The experimental results are reported in Although the FactSage model Tridymite and cristobalite have up to 0.45 mol.% solubility of ZnO (see New phase equilibria information in the PbO-ZnO and the PbO-ZnO-SiO The authors would like to thank Nyrstar (Australia), Outotec Pty Ltd (Australia), Aurubis AG (Germany), Umicore NV (Belgium), and Kazzinc Ltd, Glencore (Kazakhstan), and Australian Research Council Linkage project LP150100783 for their financial support for this research.
