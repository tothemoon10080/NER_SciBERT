This article reports the synthesis and the characterization of novel fluorous ionic liquids with fluorous anions to be used as carrier for fluorous supported liquid membrane in view of future applications to the extraction of metal ions. Dialkylimidazolium perfluorodialkylphosphate with C8, C10 and C12 phosphate chains have been synthetized as ionic liquid. The different dialkylimidazolium cations were prepared by microwave technique. Finally, 1-butyl-3-decylimidazolium di(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecylphosphate) was found as the most appropriated ionic liquid for the considering application and was characterized with volumetric mass density, viscosity and thermal stability measures.Ionic liquids were recently used to separate metal cations by various methods [ The support membrane used for the facilitated transport of metal cations in water is poly(vinyldifluoride). The PVDF membrane being an hydrophobic fluorous polymer, we sought to use the concept of fluorophilic and hydrophobic properties of the fluorous compounds in order to improve the retention of ionic fluorous liquids on membranes. In fact fluorous compounds have a strong affinity for fluorophilic and hydrophobic fluorous polymers in the presence of water. These properties were already used by Horvath et al. [ We have chosen to use imidazolium perfluorodialkylphosphate. The nature of exchangeable cation is not very important, ionic liquid based on imidazolium cation are the most common. The nature of anion is fundamental in the transport of metallic cations [ For the synthesis of the dialkylimidazolium di(perfluoroalkyl)phosphates ( At the beginning of this study, the dialkylimidazolium cations were synthesized by imidazol alkylation by classical thermal activation ( The results of dialkylimidazolium synthesis were summarised in A nonfluorinated spacer was used in order to preserve the reactivity of the alcohol group. A spacer arm of only one carbon could especially result in elimination reactions under basic conditions so a fluorous alcohols with a two carbons spacer arm were chosen. These compounds obtained by oligomerisation of ethylene/tetrafluoroethylene are commercially available. In order to exploit the synthesized ionic liquid as carrier in membrane, it was necessary that ionic liquid was insoluble in water and soluble in organic solvent for the membrane impregnation. So, the choice of the chain length needs to find the true balance between hydrophobic and solvent solubility properties. Consequently, we have prepared and test perfluorinated phosphates with C Perfluorinated dialkylphosphates were generally prepared from phosphoryl trichloride as surfactants [ The process previously described in literature used organic or inorganic base and conducted to salt impurities. This way of synthesis was discarded because no efficient method was found to eliminate the salt impurities in the ionic liquid. For the synthesis of perfluorodialkylphosphate without salt we have first prepared a perfluorodialkylphosphite using the McCombie process [ The synthesis of the ionic liquid was carried out without isolation of perfluorodialkylphosphate (see experimental part). The overall yields of the reactions are displayed in The structures were confirmed by With the aim of using this ionic liquid as carrier in a supported liquid membrane, the measure of its solubility in organic solvents became necessary. The ionic liquid must be soluble in an organic solvent and insoluble in water to prevent its leakage during the metal ions extraction experiments. The volumetric mass density of the ionic liquid at room temperature was 1.143 ± 0.001 g.cm First, we have performed an empirical qualitative study of solubility with common solvents: The same amount of ionic liquid and solvent (1 cm In order to predict the solubility of the ionic liquid in other non polar solvents, the Small hypothesis [ The ionic liquid solubility parameter was 7.7 H for [C The values of ionic liquids viscosities are interesting to know for investigations of intermolecular interactions and calculation of fluid dynamics. The viscosity of the fluorod ionic liquid was 0.26 Pa.s (260 cP). This value is large compared to those of the most common liquid ionic due to the hindered 1-butyl-3-decylimidazolium cation and di(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecylphosphate) anion. Yu et al. have showed that the more the cation is large and asymmetric, more the ionic liquid is viscous [ The thermal stability of the liquid ionic was observed until 230 °C, which is high due to the fluorous chains. A quick loss of mass was observed between 50 and 200 °C (about 30%) with an inflexion point at 100 °C which corresponds to the vaporization of linked water molecules. After 230 °C, the loss of mass increased until total degradation at 400 °C. The studies on thermal decomposition of imidazoliums performed by Maton et al [ The imidazolium bromides were synthesized using an Anton-Paar monowave 300 microwave reactor monitored by a computer. The volumetric mass of the ionic liquid (g cm The viscosity of pure liquid ionic was measured using a Discovery Hybrid Rheometer (HR2 from TA Instrument) using a plan-cone geometry and a standard-size double concentric cylinder geometry. Flow experiments were performed between 0.01 and 1000 s The thermal stability of the ionic liquid was studied by thermal gravimetric analysis using a TA Instruments Q500 TGA. The measurements were performed on 8 mg mass sample at 10 °C min All reagents were used as received without further purification unless otherwise specified. N-butylimidazole, N-methylimidazole, 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctanol, 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecanol, 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorododecanol were purchased from Alfa Aesar, 1-bromobutane, 1-bromohexane, 1-bromooctane, 1-bromodecane were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Phosphorus trichloride was purchased from Acros: its purity was controlled by A mixture of 20 mmol of 1-alkylbromide and 20 mmol of 1-alkylimidazole in 30 ml of toluene was refluxed for 12 h under nitrogen. The obtained ionic liquids were washed with diethyl ether (3 x 20 mL). No further purification was needed. The ionic liquids were obtained as brown viscous oils (yield: 69 to 76%). A mixture of 20 mmol of 1-alkylimidazole and 20 mmol of alkylbromide were irradiated by microwave (2450 MHz) in a closed 30 ml glass reactor. The reaction mixture was stirred and heated at the chosen temperature for 8 or 10 min ( 1  1  1  1  1        To a 1000 ml RB flask fitted with a magnetic stir bar, 10 mmol of the appropriate fluorous alcohol were placed and heated above their melting point under Argon atmosphere. 3 mmol (0.41 g; 0.25 mL) of phosphorus trichloride were added dropwise over a period of 15 min. The mixture was heated at 90 °C for 6 h. 9 mmol of cold (−18 °C) H      NMR               The aim of this work was to find appropriate ionic liquids as carrier for fluorous supported liquid membrane in view of future application to the extraction of metal ions. For this application, it was necessary to have solubility in organic solvent for the membrane impregnation and hydrophobic properties to avoid the carrier leakage. To obtain this balance, ionic liquids with various chain lengths were synthesized: fluorous phosphates with C8, C10 and C12 chains and imidazolium with various chain lengths. The 1-butyl-3-decylimidazolium di(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecylphosphate) was found as the most appropriated ionic liquid for the considering application and was characterized. The metal ions extraction experiments with these selected ionic liquids will be reported in the near future. The authors gratefully acknowledge the
