In this study magnesium oxide was used to treat acid mine drainage (AMD). The results showed that AMD can be treated by using MgO. Sulphur and heavy metals content such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, zinc, nickel and manganese were decreased after reaction with MgO. For heavy metals, only manganese concentration did not comply with Standards A and B of the Environmental Act 1974 after reaction. For pH values, only AMD treated with 0.5 g of MgO did not comply with both standards. The best parameter chosen was 1.5 g of MgO after 10 minutes treatment in which its pH read 7.04 Â± 0.01 that complied with Standards A and B. The parameter was also chosen because it cost less compared to other parameters employed in this study.
