The adsorption mechanism of calcium ion is a piece of important information for understanding the performance of quartz activation. In this work, the adsorption of calcium ion on quartz (101) surface in aqueous was studied through DFT calculations. The effective coordination number of calcium ion and the corresponding coordination structure in aqueous were simulated to confirm activation components. Meanwhile, adsorption energies of three sites (top, bridge and hollow) on quartz surface were calculated to investigate the preferred adsorption position, while adsorption structure of calcium ion in aqueous was also determined by DFT calculation. PDOS projections and Mulliken populations were carried out to explore the CaO bonding nature. The analytical results indicated that the formation of Ca-Oq (calcium ion in aqueous and O atom on quartz surface) bond and hydration process of quartz surface were both closely related to calcium ion adsorption on the quartz surface. The simulated adsorption structures were accordant with the experimental data of the FT-IR spectra analysis.Flotation, one of the most efficient mineral processing methods in separation science, has been widely used to concentrate valuable minerals [ Calcium ion has a particularly strong affinity to quartz compared with most of other metallic ions such as iron and magnesium ion [ Density functional theory (DFT) studies and Molecular Dynamics (MD) methods have been applied into mineral processing to provide an accurate explanation for flotation behaviors. The simulation study carrying out different amines with number of carbon atoms in alkyl chain varying from 10 to 18 suggested that the interaction between collector and minerals surface could be enhanced by increasing of carbon atom number in the alkyl chain [ Although DFT methods have been used to explore the activation of calcium ion on quartz surface, theoretical study included structure of calcium ion complexes and the corresponding bonding natures has not been found yet. Thus, in order to clarify the adsorption mechanism of calcium ion on quartz at atomic and electronic level, DFT-MD simulations were applied to make a comprehensive understanding on calcium ion or its complex structures in aqueous and find out the most efficient activation component of calcium ion. Meanwhile, different adsorption models of calcium ion complexes on quartz surface and the corresponding reaction energies were compared to determine the optimal adsorption form. This work will provide a novel insight into the adsorption mechanism of calcium ion on quartz surface. The spin restricted DFT calculation was carried out using CASTEP program [ The surface was created by cleaving the bulk unit cell of quartz at (101) cleavage plane and using (3 × 2 × 2) super-cell with 15 Å vacuum layers [ As alkali salt ion, calcium ion would be hydrolyzed in water, and the hydrolysis species would be the primary adsorption component on quartz surface. Several researches have indicated that the hydration spheres of alkali-metal ions with the fixed number of water were the primary existing forms in water [ Calculations of all possible hydration species of calcium ion were performed with DMol3 modules in MS 8.0. The electronic structure was described with GGA-PBE approximation. All-electron double-numeric-polarized (DNP) basis with a cutoff radius of 5.5 Å was used to set on all atoms [ Besides, the dominated structure of calcium ion in water can be determined from pair radial distribution functions (RDFs)(Designated as g After calculated as above, all possible active ingredients were optimized in a periodic cell of 10 × 10 × 10 Å As a layered trigonal crystal system, quartz was made up of a continuous framework of SiO The feasibility of adsorption was evaluated by the total adsorption energy (Δ In aqueous solution, calcium ion may be presented in various forms such as Ca(II), Ca(OH)(I), Ca(OH) As shown in According to the research about the coordination shell of the calcium ion in solution, six water molecules in an octahedral arrangement was contained in the hydration shell [ The corresponding energies are calculated according to the As shown in Thus, it was considered that the calcium ion was as the form of [Ca(H MD simulations for the preferred hydrated species of [Ca(H In In this section, the adsorption process of [Ca(H It can be seen from The more favorable adsorption configurations of B and F are displayed in The hydration of quartz surface can make a non-negligible amount of positive charge accumulate on quartz surface and promote the adsorption reaction of anionic collectors. Thus, hydration phenomenon on the quartz surface have significant influence on the adsorption of [Ca(H Adsorption configurations of [Ca(OH)(H The configurations B and F, as shown in To sum up, when quartz (101) surface was exposed to [Ca(H PDOS projections and Mulliken populations for Ca and O atoms were carried out to explore the Ca The charge transfers and bond populations in configuration B of [Ca(H All values of Ca The adsorption structure and the bonding mechanism of calcium ion activation on quartz (101) surface in aqueous system have been investigated by DFT method. The preferred hydrated species of [Ca(H This work was supported by the open fund of
