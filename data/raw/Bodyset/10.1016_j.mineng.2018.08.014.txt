The solvent extraction and stripping of copper have been conducted in a Y-Y type microchannel reactor. The experimental results demonstrate that the Y-Y type microchannel reactor can be used for both Cu extraction and Cu stripping. The effects of residence time, aqueous phase pH, and concentration of extractant on the extent of extraction were investigated. The results indicated that the extent of extraction and the separation factor using a Y-Y type microchannel reactor are greater than those obtained with a conventional batch extraction. The maximum extraction of copper reached 86.02%. Also, the stripping reaction was studied with respect to Cu2+ concentration in the loaded organic phase, H2SO4 concentration, and the organic/aqueous phase ratio. The maximum stripping of copper reached 98.94%.

Due to its unique properties, copper is essential for many economic sectors, including uses for infrastructure, wiring, plumbing, transportation, and consumer and industrial electrical equipment ( In recent years, solvent extraction using microreactors has received much attention, due to enhanced mass transfer in the microflow process ( The above results reported in the literature indicate that microfluidic solvent extraction has good prospects for the extraction and separation of metals. The goal of the current research was to apply microfluidic solvent extraction technology to copper hydrometallurgy. As is well known, the hydrometallurgy of copper includes the processes of leaching, solvent extraction, stripping, and electrowinning ( The extractant, DZ988N, a mixture of 5-nonylsalicylaldoxime and 2-hydroxy-5-nonyl-acetophenoneoxime with a volume ratio of 1:1, was supplied by De Song Technology Co., Ltd, China. The Mextral DT100 (containing > 99% aliphatics and <0.5% aromatics) was supplied by the Hallochem Group Co., Ltd, China, and was used as diluent. In all extraction experiments, the organic phase was obtained by dissolving the extractant, DZ988N, into the Mextral DT100. The reagents, CuSO In all extraction experiments, the aqueous phase was prepared by using CuSO A schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in The organic phase and aqueous phase were pumped into the Y-Y type microchannel reactor via the two inlets by two microsyringe pumps (LSP01-1B, Baoding Longer Precision Pump Co., Ltd., Baoding, China, accuracy ≤ ± 0.5%). The organic phase and aqueous phase merged at the beginning of the mixing channel, the inlet Y-junction, and separated at the end of the mixing microchannel, the outlet Y-junction. The flow pattern of the two phases was determined using a high speed camera during the experiments. The mixing microchannel (the microchannel from inlet Y-junction to outlet Y-junction) is where the extraction and stripping reactions took place. In the extraction experiments, most of the Cu The concentrations of Cu, Fe and Zn in the aqueous phase were determined using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (AA240FS ICP-AES spectrophotometer, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and the concentrations of Cu, Fe and Zn extracted to the organic phase were obtained by mass balance. The solvent extraction and stripping of copper from aqueous solutions with DZ988N dissolved in Mextral DT100 can be written as follows: The forward reaction is the extraction reaction, and the reverse reaction is the stripping reaction. The extent of extraction is defined as follows ( The distribution ratio is defined as follows: The separation factor is calculated using the following equation ( The extent of stripping is defined as follows ( The overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient ( In order to determine the preferred flow conditions for extraction and stripping, flow simulation was carried out using the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics. The simulation results were verified by flow visualization experiments. According to The level set function The height and width of the microchannel reactor used in the numerical model were the same as those for the experimental system. The length of the mixing channel in the simulation was 500 μm. The results showed that 500 μm was enough for the simulated flow pattern to be stabilized in the microchannel. The physical properties of the organic and aqueous phases are shown in The organic phase velocity to aqueous phase velocity ratio is defined as the velocity ratio. The velocity ratios of 1:4, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1 and 4:1 were selected to investigate the effect of flow rate ratio on the flow patterns for numerical simulation. The volumetric flow rate of the aqueous phase was constant at 0.05 mL/min corresponding to velocity of 1.7 × 10 The experimental flow patterns of the aqueous phase and organic phase are shown in Extraction of copper from sulfate solution containing Fe As commonly and conveniently done, residence time is controlled by setting different flow rates in the microchannel reactor. The flow rate of the aqueous phase ( The extraction of copper increased with an increase in residence time, but there was no significant increase when the residence time was greater than 0.783 s. The extraction of copper reached 80.61% at a residence time of 0.783 s. The corresponding flow rate of both the aqueous and organic phase was 0.05 mL/min. There was an increase in the extraction of iron and zinc when the residence time was less than 0.783 s and there was no significant increase when the residence time was greater than 0.783 s. The extraction of iron was less than 1.1% and of zinc was less than 0.5%. However, the extent of the extraction for copper increased as the residence time increased from 20 s to 60 s for the conventional batch experiment. A maximum of 77.72% copper extraction was observed at the residence time of 60 s for the batch testing, which was obviously lower than 80.61% for the microchannel reactor extraction, at a residence time of 0.783 s. The results indicate that copper extraction kinetics in the batch extraction is much slower than that in the microchannel reactor extraction. The co-extraction of iron and zinc in the batch test was obviously higher than that in the microchannel extraction. A higher separation factor for the microchannel reactor extraction was observed and is much higher than that for the batch testing, as evidenced by the results in The variation of the overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient ( The pH value is an important factor for extraction and separation of copper using the DZ988N extractant. Experiments were carried out at room temperature to study the effect of varied pH values (a range of 0.58–2.00) on the extraction of copper using 10% (v/v) DZ988N in Mextral DT100. The hydrolysis of Fe The extraction efficiency of copper increased with an increase in the pH value from pH 0.58 to pH 2.00, with the extraction efficiency of copper increasing to 80.61% at a pH of 2.00. This is shown in the forward reaction of Eq. The copper extraction experiments were carried out with varied DZ988N concentrations from 5% (v/v) to 25% (v/v) at an aqueous phase pH of 2.00. The results are shown in  From the extraction experiments, it was shown that the DZ988N could extract Cu selectively from the Cu-Fe-Zn mixed solution. In this section the application of the Y-Y type of microchannel for Cu stripping from the organic phase, which is an important step to prepare the Cu solution for electrowinning, was also evaluated. The procedures of the Cu stripping experiment are similar to the experiments of extraction. Effects of Cu The effect of Cu From To study the influence of H As shown in The volume ratio of organic to aqueous phases will be adjusted by the flow rate ratio in the Y-Y microchannel. Two phase volume ratios of 1/3, 1/2, 1/1, and 2/1 were selected to investigate the influence of volume ratio on stripping. The flow rates of the two phases are shown in From The solvent extraction and stripping of copper has been performed in a Y-Y type microchannel reactor. Effects of residence time, aqueous phase pH, and concentration of extractant on the extent of extraction were investigated and the overall volumetric mass transfer coefficients ( The extents of extraction and the separation factors in Y-Y type microchannel reactors are higher than those in batch extraction. The optimal residence time of 0.783 s in a microchannel reactor is much less than that in batch extraction (at least 60 s). The maximum extraction and stripping of copper reached 86.02% and 98.94%, respectively. The maximum separation factors, Many researchers have indicated that the microreactor could be scaled up easily by the numbering-up approach to avoid pilot scale testing. For example, a microreactor has been successfully used for producing nitroglycerine at Xi’an North Huian Chemical Industry Co., in Xi’an, China ( None. This work was supported by the
