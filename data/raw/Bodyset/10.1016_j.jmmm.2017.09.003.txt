The magnetic properties of pulsed laser deposited Co-Zn ferrite [Co1−xZnxFe2O4 (0.1≤x≤0.7)] nanocrystalline thin films have been investigated. The films were deposited on amorphous quartz substrate. The observed magnetic properties of the films depend on the deposition temperature (TS), the annealing temperature (TA) and the Zn content (x). A magnetization value higher than bulk was observed in a room temperature deposited Co rich (x=0.1) Co-Zn ferrite thin films, when the films were ex-situ annealed at TA
                     =750°C. On the other hand, in Zn rich (x=0.7) Co-Zn ferrite, a magnetization value higher than bulk (x=0.7) was obtained in a film deposited at TS
                     =750°C. The unusual magnetization values are explained on the basis of grain growth and the cation distribution in thin films.The saturation magnetization (M Pure Co ferrite is an inverse spinel ferrite, in which Co As the magnetic properties of both Co ferrite and Zn ferrite have been observed to be quite different when prepared in the thin film form, we have carried out a systematic study on Co-Zn ferrite thin films with x Co Structural studies were carried out using a PANalytical X’Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer (XRD) using CuK  The FEGTEM studies have been carried out on RT deposited Co We have estimated the average grain sizes of the Co The M-H loops, at 300    M-H loops were measured in the temperature range from 10 to 300 We obtained the value of B and M It is seen from the  One of the important results of our study is that the M Magnetization in spinel systems is a manifestation of cation occupancies on A and B-sites In the case of Zn rich (x The quenching rates are higher when the films are deposited at lower substrate temperatures (T In pure Zn ferrite thin films, on the other hand, it has been found that the magnetization shows strong but non-monotonic dependence on average grain size We expect iron to be present only in Fe We have carried out X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on Co An interesting result observed from our study is the monotonic redution of the exchange stiffness constant ‘D’ with increase in x for the films deposited at 750 The coercivity value of the RT deposited films annealed at higher T The M Authors thank IRCC central facilities for magnetization (VSM) and XPS measurements in Department of Physics, IIT Bombay.
