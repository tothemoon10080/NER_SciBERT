This paper addresses the potential of mechanochemical activation of MgO and α-Fe2O3 precursor powders to obtain Fe2.3Mg0.7O4 ceramics with enhanced redox stability and electrical conductivity. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Mössbauer spectroscopy suggest the initial formation of the spinel phase after 5h of high-energy milling in inert gas, but after 10h of mechanoactivation, the precursor still comprised hematite as a major phase with minor amounts of magnesiowustite as by-product. The activated mixtures can be nearly completely converted to spinel solid solution by heating to 1173K, whereas single-phase, dense spinel ceramics can be prepared by sintering at 1773K in inert atmosphere. These ceramics demonstrated redox stability under mildly reducing conditions (p(O2)∼10Pa), as confirmed by XRD, thermogravimetry and electrical measurements. The electrical conductivity of Fe2.3Mg0.7O4 at this oxygen partial pressure is lower compared to magnetite, but it is still as high as 60S/cm at 1073K and 15S/cm at room temperature. Cooling below 1473K in air results in a drop of conductivity due to segregation of hematite phase at the grain boundaries. However, the phase separation is kinetically stagnated at 1073K, and, after slight initial degradation, the retained electrical conductivity is more than 3 orders of magnitude higher compared to hematite and MgFe2O4 spinel.Magnesioferrite MgFe The electronic transport in ferrospinels is considered to occur via small polaron hopping between Fe The stability limits imposed by temperature and the oxygen partial pressure ( High-energy mechanochemical treatment is a convenient and simple route for the synthesis of nanocrystalline or amorphous materials at room temperature. It has been used for preparation of spinel powders with enhanced chemical reactivity and non-equilibrium cation distributions.
