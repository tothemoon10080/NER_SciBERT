Creep experiments were performed on extruded Al–6Mg–2Sc–1Zr (wt.%) alloy in a temperature range of 423–533K. A threshold type creep behavior was measured and explained by observed dislocation-particle interactions. The experimental threshold stress values at various temperatures were compared with existing theoretical models. None of the available models could account for the decrease in threshold creep strength with increasing temperature.Commercial aluminum alloys for high performance applications can be used up to 423–443 Scandium containing aluminum alloys have received considerable attention in the last few years because of the remarkable strengthening effect of Sc additions In this paper the creep behavior of fine-grained Al–6Mg–2Sc–1Zr alloy in the 423–533 The Al–6Mg–2Sc–1Zr alloy used in present study was prepared by the powder metallurgy route. Helium atomized powder was extruded at 523    A temperature compensated power law creep equation for minimum strain rate This exponent increases with decreasing applied stress, which is indicative of true threshold type behavior. The threshold stress ( An apparent activation energy ( The average grain size was 275 ± 90 Various models have been proposed for the origin of threshold stress for creep in dispersion-strengthened materials The Creep behavior of fine-grained Al–6Mg–2Sc–1Zr alloy was measured in a temperature range of 423–533 The authors would like to gratefully acknowledge the support of the National Science Foundation through grant DMR-0100780.
