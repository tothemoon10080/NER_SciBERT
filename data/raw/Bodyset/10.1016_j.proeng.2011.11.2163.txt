Aiming at the shortage of optimization software for mine ventilation system, such as insufficient function, poor universal property, cockamamie data input and bad visualization, etc., an all-purpose simulation and optimization software for mine ventilation system of underground mines was programmed by VB language based on SQL Server database and the 3d drawing software â€“ SolidWorks. It has solved many problems such as mine ventilation information management, automatic drawing 3d mine ventilation stereogram, automatic calculating mine ventilation network and automatic noting ventilation network parameters, etc. It was proved to be excellently reliable, utile and prospect through application in several metal mines.
