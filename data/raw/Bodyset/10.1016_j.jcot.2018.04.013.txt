We are delighted to present a dedicated issue of the Journal of Clinical Orthopaedics and Trauma, focusing on the lower limb. We have seen that in the last few decades some of the reconstructive surgical procedures (like arthroplasty, arthroscopy and open reduction and internal fixation of the fractures) have become very popular amongst Orthopaedic Surgeons, due to their outstanding success and track record. Hence, we have chosen some fascinating research articles related to lower limb Arthroplasty, Arthroscopy, and Fractures in this issue. Arthroplasty in younger and older population is challenging and remains a topic of debate amongst Orthopaedic surgeons. Halawi et al. After an outstanding success and acceptability of arthroscopic procedures of the knee, amongst the patients and doctors, arthroscopy is now being done in increasing numbers in other joints of the body, like shoulder, hip, ankle and elbow joints. Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction is perhaps one of the most commonly performed and rewarding arthroscopic surgery Pelvic fractures may be associated with life-threatening complications, like fat embolism.
