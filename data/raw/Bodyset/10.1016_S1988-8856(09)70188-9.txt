Purpose
                  To expound our experience of percutaneous screw fixation in the treatment of certain hand fractures.
               
                  Materials and methods
                  We carried out a prospective study between November 2002 and November 2006, in which 84 patients with hand fractures were treated by means of closed screw osteosynthesis. The injury was located at the base of the first metacarpal in 12 cases (14.28%) the remainder being phalangeal fractures (85.71%). All fractures were closed, 40 of them intra-articular (47.61%). The most frequent fracture type was the long oblique fracture, which was present in 68 cases (80.95%).
               
                  Results
                  Functional results obtained at the last follow-up visit (6 months) were excellent in 64 patients (76.19%), good in 15 (17.86%) and poor in 5 (5.95%).
               
                  Conclusions
                  Percutaneous screw fixation sharply reduces immobilization time permitting earlier functional recovery without causing any cosmetic defects. It is a highly useful technique for carefully selected fractures and patients.
