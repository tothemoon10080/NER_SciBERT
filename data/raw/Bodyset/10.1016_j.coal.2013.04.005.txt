Coal macerals are the product of a complex series of decompositional and preservational pathways from living woody and herbaceous tissues to the variety of forms seen in coal. The Cretaceous Wulantuga coal (Inner Mongolia, China) offers an opportunity to observe a number of maceral forms resulting from these disparate pathways. Assemblages of coprolites within fusinite strongly suggest an origin related to arthropod ingestion and consequent in situ emplacement of the macrinitic coprolites within the damaged wood structure, followed by combustion of the whole to achieve the observed reflectance.  In this work, we focus on the maceral forms noted by The samples were collected from the Lower Cretaceous No. 6 coal, Wulantuga Ge ore deposit, Shengli coalfield, Inner Mongolia, China by Epoxy-bound particulate pellets of the coal samples investigated by Digital photography was accomplished using Diagnostic Instruments Spot Insight cameras. All digital photographs presented here are from C6-1 through C6-13 split 1. The individual sample number of our photographs is reflected in our labeling of the images in Vitrinite is present in the gelified, but otherwise non-degraded forms expected in subbituminous A/high volatile C bituminous coal, as seen in the telinite/collotelinite assemblage in Some fusinite and semifusinite macerals with well-defined cell walls and open cell lumens ( Although some sporinite and other liptinite macerals are undamaged, other liptinite macerals (as noted above in reference to Funginite is clearly recognizable in As discussed in our previous works, the origin of macrinite has a close connection to fungal and bacterial activity (  Macrinite, possibly derived from arthropod coprolites, was noted to be closely associated with fusinite ( Within attrital portions of the coal, larger coprolites occur ( Aside from direct damage to trees from the burrowing phytophagous fauna, fungi can enter the tree directly associated with the fauna or incidentally though the same entry point ( Plant material can take multiple and convoluted pathways to the macerals seen in coal. Just among the wood or wood-like starting material alone, as illustrated on be humified or gelified to huminite and, with continued coalification, to vitrinite ( be charred directly to fusinite or semifusinite ( undergo fungal and/or bacterial degradation and/or arthropod (or other) ingestion and excretion followed by charring to form a degradofusinite/degradosemifusinite ( undergo fungal and/or bacterial degradation and/or arthropod (or other) ingestion and excretion on a path to macrinite ( undergo multiple cycles of fungal and/or bacterial degradation and/or arthropod (or other) ingestion and excretion (coprophagous activity) on a path to macrinite ( To some degree all of the latter processes, and certainly 2 through 5, can happen in the living, still-standing plant. The association of macrinitic coprolites within fusinite ( This research was supported in part by the
