The calculating models of mass action concentrations for electrolyte aqueous solutions NaBr-H2O, LiNO3-H2O, HNO3-H2O, and KF-H2O have been developed at 298.15 K and their molalities ranging from 0.1 mol/kg to saturation according to the ion and molecule coexistence theory as well as mass action law. The calculated mass action concentration is based on pure species as the standard state and the mole fraction as the concentration unit, and the reported activities are usually based on infinite dilution as the standard state and molality as the concentration unit. Hence, the calculated mass action concentration must be transformed to the same standard state and concentration unit. The transformation coefficients between calculated mass action concentrations and reported activities of the same component fluctuate in a very narrow range. Thus, the transformed mass action concentrations not only agree well with reported activities, but also strictly obey mass action law. The calculated results show that the new developed models can embody the intrinsic structure of investigated four electrolyte aqueous solutions. The results also indicate that mass action law has its widespread applicability to electrolyte binary aqueous solutions.
