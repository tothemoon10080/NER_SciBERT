A novel technology of removing H2S with cupric chloride solution was developed in this paper. Cupric as the form of CuS deposition, the CuS produced was then oxidized by excessive cupric ion in another reactor meanwhile cupric ion that has been consumed can be recovered by the oxidization of CuClâˆ’
                     2 with oxygen in air, and the solution can be circulated. Moreover, the leaching kinetics of CuS by cupric ion was studied. The removal efficiency of H2S is close to 100%, and the required operating condition is mild. Compared with other wet oxidization methods, no raw material is consumed except O2 in air, the process has no secondary pollution and no problem of degradation and scale, and the absorbent is much stable and reliable.
