A large amount of sulfur-bearing hazardous wastes, including sulfur sludge, are generated in the production and processing of oil/natural gas/coal gas/biomass gas, which are difficult to dispose of with traditional processes, such as incineration or landfills. In the present work, a homemade membrane bioreactor (MBR) with an efficient volume of 10 m3 was utilized to continuously and efficiently remove sulfur (S0) from sulfur sludge and produce sulfuric acid (H2SO4) by using chemoautotrophic acidophilic cells on an industrial scale for the first time. The bio-oxidation process was also modelled and optimized by using response surface methodology. The quadratic models describe the causal relationships between the production rate of H2SO4 at pH 1.0 or the time required for the pH to decrease to 1.0 and three important control parameters (temperature, aeration rate and stirring velocity). The MBR maintained high-density growth of cells (≈2.1 × 109/mL) throughout the entire operational period due to the excellent interception performance, establishing a basis for efficient sulfur removal and H2SO4 production. Under the optimized process controls of 33.6 °C for the temperature, 3.1 m3/min for the aeration rate and 83 rpm for the stirring velocity, a high production efficiency of H2SO4 at pH 1.0 (≈850 L/h) is obtained. Accordingly, the sulfur removal efficiency and sulfur residual concentrations reached 93% and 4.1% after 20 days of contact, respectively. The current study demonstrates that the MBR is suitable for industrial scale operations, for continuous and efficient sulfur removal and for production of H2SO4 from sulfur-bearing hazardous wastes. The green microbial means not only save very expensive disposal expense of sulfur-bearing hazardous wastes but also gain benefits through the manufacture of valuable H2SO4, displaying great business value and wide application prospect.H In the process of desulfurization of oil/natural gas/coal gas/biomass gas to generate high purity elemental sulfur ( Recently, the removal of sulfur from a wide range of sulfur-containing materials or wastes, such as coal, petcoke and ground tire rubber, by a variety of microorganisms has been of interest because of the unique advantages, such as a simple process, low cost, environmental friendliness and no hazardous byproducts ( In this study, the microbial removal of elemental sulfur from a typical sulfur sludge from natural gas desulfurization by a mixed culture of acidophilic bacteria was explored to simultaneously remove sulfur and produce H In this work, two acidophilic cells, The inorganic salt medium (K The MBR is obtained by installing four sets of affiliated equipment (stirring, heating, aeration and membrane assembly) to a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-based column with an efficient working volume of approximately 10 m The MBR was filled with 10 m Under altered process conditions of temperature, aeration rate and stirring velocity, the pH value in the bioreactor decreased from the initial 2.7 to 1.0 after approximately 10–30 days of contact. The accurate time needed for the pH value to decrease to 1.0 was recorded as an important dependent variable (Y In the optimization of the industrial-scale generation of H A central composite design (CCD) was utilized to investigate three important process factors (i.e., aeration rate from 1.0 to 3.5 m³/min, temperature from 25 to 40 °C and agitation speed from 30 to 100 rpm, which was chosen according to the previous work ( The detailed definition and presentation of the dependent and independent variables are available in In Equation This study is the first to grow acidophilic cells and produce H Although the non-optimal conditions in the batch start test permit a maximum cell density of 2.0 × 10 The observed values of the time (Y Based on linear regression analysis by professional software Design-Expert V8.06, the polynomial regression models as equations describing the quantitative relationships between two dependent variables (Y The production of sulfuric acid (L/h): The time required for the pH to decrease to 1.0 (Day): ANOVA for the quadratic equation of Y Diagramming Equations ANOVA of every variable term in the quadratic models of Y In the case where interaction between factors is of statistical significance, surface plots give more complete information regarding the effect of a factor on the response ( It was shown that the temperature and aeration rate jointly affected both the duration needed for the pH to decline to 1.0 and the production efficiency of H Similar to the aeration rate, the effect of stirring velocity on both H Based on the predicted models and confirmation experiments, the optimum conditions for the production of H It was found that in the course of continuous H In recent years, a large quantity of sulfur-bearing solid wastes, such as sulfur sludge, sulfur mud, sulfur slurry and sulfur paste, has been generated in the production and process of oil/natural gas/coal gas/biomass gas ( In this work, an MBR with an efficient volume of 10.0 m In many cases, however, these sulfur-bearing wastes, including natural gas-derived sulfur sludge, contain heavy metals and toxic organic compounds, which may harm the growth of cells and negatively affect the production of H In order to assure the growth and activity of mixed culture of acidophilic bacteria, the addition of mineral salts and pyrite and the consumption of electric power to supply CO The MBR keeps a high cells concentration (≈2.1 × 10 Yiran Yang: Conceptualization; Methodology; Investigation; Writing - Original Draft.
