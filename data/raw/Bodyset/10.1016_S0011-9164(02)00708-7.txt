The co-transport of silver from nitric acid solutions across a bulk liquid membrane (BLM) in a HF contactor and across a layered BLM with a new carrier octylphenylmethane-sulfide (MF18) have been studied. The transport rate of silver through a BLM containing the MF18 in the HF contactor is much lower comparing with the carrier Cyanex 471X what is connected with a lower value of the distribution coefficient of Ag for MF18. With increasing concentration of the carrier MF18 in the BLM the transport rate of Ag increases what is quite different for Cyanex where the flux do not change with the carrier concentration. This is connected with faster kinetics of the Ag- MF18 complex decomposition.
