Management of technological processes at a modern level is not possible without use of intellectual systems as top level of automated management in hierarchical system structure. Influence of human factor in management of technological process frequently has destructive character. Creation of intellectual and self-developing expert systems for the technological process management, including mineral processing of nonferrous metal ores, in most promising and fast-developing directions is required. The following features characterize the suggested method of top-level intellectual management system construction:
                        
                           •
                           The intellectual management systems are applicable to the integrated, interconnected structures, including ore preparation, reagent dosing, flotation, etc.
                        
                        
                           •
                           They provide control of processing equipment standing, and availability of automatic on/off system, acting in case of their failures
                        
                        
                           •
                           They provide control of field equipment and updates in case of their failures
                        
                        
                           •
                           Simple and convenient interface “system-technologist-operator”
