This chapter deals with the production of biological and environmental Certified Reference Materials (CRMs), which is one of the main activities of the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM), Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, and Geel (Belgium). The Reference Materials Unit was requested by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit√† (ISS), Rome (Italy) to perform the transformation of a batch of ca. 80 kg wet Antarctic coastal marine sediment, collected in the Terra Nova Bay during the XI Italian Expedition to the Antarctic, into a sampled, dry and conservable powder to be certified for the content of a range of elements. A candidate CRM for trace elements in Antarctic coastal marine sediment was prepared by coarse sieving, drying, jet-milling with ultrafine classification of particles and Turbula mixing. The material was found to be of appropriate particle size distribution, dryness and homogeneity to be certified as a stable and homogeneous CRM.
