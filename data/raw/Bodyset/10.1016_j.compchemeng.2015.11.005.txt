The shrinking supplies of freshwater globally, coupled with strict environmental regulations, have driven the manufacturing industry towards sustainable water management for the minimisation of freshwater intake and wastewater generation. By using process integration and its enabling tools, this work considers the synthesis of an optimal water network with multiple regeneration capabilities. Development of the proposed framework is achieved by embedding a subnetwork of detailed electrodialysis models within a water network. Based on a superstructure and fixed flowrate, the optimisation problem is formulated as an MINLP model and solved in GAMS/DICOPT. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed mathematical model a literature case study on a pulp and paper plant is presented and the results indicate a potential of 12% savings in freshwater intake, 16% reduction in wastewater generated and a 14% saving in the total annualised cost for the entire network.{ { { liquid recovery for regenerator, Faraday constant cell width valence LCD constant LCD constant conversion factor current utilisation spacer shadow factor cell thickness total membrane resistance volume factor equivalent conductance solution viscosity pumping efficiency safety factor cost of electricity cost of membrane freshwater cost wastewater treatment cost maximum equipment life operating time per year parameter for carbon steel piping parameter for carbon steel piping interest rate per year pipe linear velocity Manhattan distance between source, Manhattan distance between regenerator, Manhattan distance between regenerators Manhattan distance between source, total annualised cost for regenerator, membrane area required by regenerator specific desalination energy required by regenerator specific pumping energy required by regenerator electric current required by regenerator stack length linear flow velocity, at stage s voltage applied pressure drop across the regenerator regenerator feed flowrate recovery rate for regenerator, splitting rate for regenerator, final diluate stream flowrate of regenerator, diluate stream flowrate for regenerator, concentrate stream flowrate for regenerator, concentrate stream recycle flowrate for regenerator, recycle stream flowrate for regenerator, final concentrate flowrate for regenerator, diluate flowrate to sink, concentrate flowrate to sink, source flowrate flowrate from source, flowrate from source, recycle from diluate stream to regenerator feed recycle from concentrate stream to regenerator feed sink, freshwater flowrate wastewater flowrate regeneration feed concentration for regenerator, concentration of feed concentrate stream for regenerator, concentration of recycling concentrate for regenerator, concentration of concentrate waste stream for regenerator, diluate contaminant concentration concentrate contaminant concentration maximum allowable regenerator concentration source concentration of maximum allowable sink concentration removal ratio for regenerator, number of cell pairs per regenerator,        Sustainability of human activities, primarily production and consumption, has been of growing concern in the process industry. Among the sustainability mega-forces, water scarcity has risen to the top of the corporate agenda for most entities in the industrial sector. On average, the manufacturing industry consumes about 22% of the total freshwater available globally and about 90% of this is disposed of as wastewater ( Process integration is a powerful and effective framework for sustainable design that emphasises the unity of a process because of the strong interactions that exist between the different unit operations ( The two optimisation approaches that remain irrefutable are the insight-based ‘pinch’ approach and mathematical programming. Most of the early work reported on water network optimisation was insight-based, which being graphically-based, focused on flowrate targeting and network design methods. Mathematical programming techniques involve the development of models based on mathematical relations that describe the system under analysis and the application of rigorous algorithms to obtain solutions. Early work on mathematical optimisation was reported by Within water networks, regeneration allows for the partial treatment of wastewater before being recycled or reused. To date, membrane-based technology emerges as one of the most sustainable contenders for regeneration mainly because of its competency to treat wastewater in single-step processes at competitive costs ( Contrary to that, Electrodialysis (ED), the regeneration technology adapted in this work, has found large industrial scale use in the production of high quality industrial water as well as wastewater treatment of industrial and municipal effluents ( In this work we consider a single-contaminant, integrated water network with multiple electrodialysis regenerators. The problem can be stated as follows. Given: A set of fixed-flowrate water sources, A freshwater source, A set of fixed-flowrate water sinks, A wastewater sink, A set of regenerators, The objective is to synthesise an optimal integrated water network and to determine the design of the ED subnetwork that corresponds with the optimal water network. The optimal configuration is one that minimises freshwater use, generation of wastewater, regeneration energy and the capital and operating costs of both regeneration and the piping interconnections. A superstructure approach that considers the water sources sinks and regeneration subnetwork simultaneously was used to formulate the water network problem considered in this work. The proposed superstructure includes all feasible interconnections between different units in the water-regeneration network and is presented in This section presents a mechanistic model formulation for a detailed design of an electrodialysis regeneration unit based on Assumptions are made in order to describe the plant using a set of mathematical equations describing its operation. The assumptions are as follows. The fluids considered are Newtonian and have steady, fully developed, incompressible, laminar flow. The unit is operated under a co-current setup. Concentrate and diluate cells have identical geometry and flow patterns and changes in the ohmic resistance of the solutions are negligible ( The concentrations of the salt species are operated using molar equivalents. Water transportation across the membrane is negligible compared to the concentrate and diluate stream flowrates ( Material balances for each regenerator were conducted in accordance with The corresponding contaminant balances are as follows: To avoid the collapse of the membrane system due to pressure differences it is assumed that the immediate diluate and concentrate streams have the same flowrate, hence: The recovery rate, The splitting rate, With regards to the design aspect of electrodialysis regenerator, important variables and physical parameters of the ED are incorporated in the mathematical relations that describe the performance of the regenerator. The electric current required to drive the electrodialysis process is given by: The practical current density is determined in terms of the linear velocity, The extent of desalination obtained by an electrodialysis unit is dependent on the membrane area, The direct energy required for the process is dependent upon the voltage and current applied on each stack. The voltage applied can be expressed as follows: The specific energy required for desalination is defined by constraint The specific pumping energy, The regeneration network involves both capital and operational costs. The representative total annualised cost ( To ensure connectivity between the regeneration network, the sources and the sinks, water balances are established based on the superstructure presented in  The flow balance for the source is modelled as: The balance for the freshwater source is modelled in a similar way.  Based on Depending on the design of the regenerator, each regenerator has a limit to the amount of contaminant that it can tolerate. In this regard, the corresponding contaminant balance for the regenerator feed was modelled as: Similarly, the water balances for the two splitters connected to the regenerator diluate and concentrate streams are given by constraints  The flow balance for the sink is modelled as: The balance for the wastewater sink is modelled in a similar way. The maximum allowable load that each sink tolerates has to be taken into account. As such the corresponding contaminant balance for each sink can be modelled as: To ensure that a diluate stream and a concentrate stream from the same regenerator are not re-mixed in a single sink or recycled into the same regenerator, the following constraints are introduced. To ensure that the maximum flowrates that can be accommodated by the piping are not exceeded, appropriate logical constraints are also included. The constraints are such that upper and lower bounds are allocated to all the flowrates. These bounds are chosen based on practically feasible flowrates, such that any stream with a flowrate beyond these limits is not allowed to exist. This is achieved by the introduction of binary variables according to constraints The objective is to minimise the total annualised cost of the water network, which comprises the freshwater cost, wastewater treatment cost, annualised regeneration cost, as well as the capital and operating cost of piping. To account for capital and operational cost of piping, the length of pipe run, material of construction and linear velocities within the pipes were considered. The formulation of the objective function is expressed in constraint The mathematical model developed is applied to a literature based pulp and paper plant case study (  To ensure a detailed analysis of the model, four scenarios are considered. Scenario 1 is water integration without regeneration. Scenario 2 is the case where water integration with regeneration involving two detailed ED regenerators is considered. However in this case, series connection and recycle within the regeneration subnetwork are forbidden just as in the case presented by The size and complexity of the model attributed to the nonconvex nature of the problem proved computationally expensive to solve. In order to cut down on CPU time, tight bounds based on physical inspection of industrial cases were imposed on certain variables (  The results also show that incorporating multiple regenerators can increase the chances of getting a better optimal solution, as long as the regenerators are not forced into the system. In this case this situation was handled by the binary variable  GAMS, unlike some platformssuch as PIMS, does not report on pi values which indicate the sensitivity of parameters on the solution. However, it does report on the marginal values, which indicate the sensitivity of the variables on the solution. Inspection of these marginal values, show that the ED number of cell pairs as well as the flowrate variables, particularly those connected to the regenerator, had the greatest impact on the solution as these had non-zero values. This work addresses the synthesis of a multi-regeneration water network by proposing an MINLP model that incorporates a detailed model of an electrodialysis regeneration subnetwork within a water network. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed mathematical model, it is applied to a literature case study and solved using GAMS/DICOPT. The results show that the use of a detailed model guarantees more accurate and reliable results in terms of water network synthesis as well as regenerator design. However, the nature and structure of the model proposed is quite complex, thereby resulting in very large computational times being incurred. Additionally, the system considered in this manuscript was limited to a single, ionic contaminant, whereas industrial effluent often contains multiple ionic contaminants as well as multiple non-ionic contaminants. As such, offering scope for future work, it would be desirable to extend the problem to allow for multiple contaminants, both ionic and non-ionic, using multiple regeneration technologies in order to be able to select the best available technology for the different streams of wastewater.
