On-line ultrasonic cleaning was used to remove fouling from a commercially important polyamide based reverse osmosis membrane during cross-flow filtration of CaSO4, Fe3+ and carboxyl cellulose solutions. In each case, the permeate flux of the membrane increased significantly, with virtually no decrease in rejection in the presence of ultrasonication. Membrane surface characterization via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the beneficial effect of ultrasonication on the membrane permeate flux. These studies suggest that ultrasonic defouling may be a very useful approach for the future development of reverse membranes, especially as far as fouling with organic materials is concerned.Membrane fouling is one of the main problems encountered in the operation of membrane systems used in the treatment of wastewater effluents. Fouling occurs through the irreversible deposition of retained particles, colloids, macromolecules and salts at the membrane surface and/or inside the membrane. This can lead to a significant decline in the permeate flux At the same time, the application of ultrasound for enhancing permeation in membrane processes has been extensively studied The effect of ultrasound was also examined by using cellophane membranes for salt dialysis, such as sodium, potassium and calcium chlorides. The variables investigated included the intensity of the ultrasound field, the solute concentration and the irradiation time Kost and Langer's patent Although ultrasound has been used to enhance the performance of membrane separation, relatively few studies have dealt with the use of ultrasonication to eliminate or prevent the fouling of membranes. The patent of Harvey A commercial polyamide-based reverse osmosis membrane suitable for low-pressure operation was obtained from Fluid Systems Company. The CaSO The experimental set-up is shown in Fresh sheet of the flat polyamide reverse osmosis membrane was cut into rectangular sections of approximately 18 The rejection values reported in this study are based on the following definition: Two different concentrations (500 and 1000 The permeate flux for the membrane filtration of CaSO The ultrasonic defouling of the reverse osmosis membrane during the filtration of the CaSO The network structure of the membrane is evident in The FeCl The permeate flux for the membrane filtration of the FeCl As be seen from The defouling effect of the membrane during Fe(OH) A 500 and 1000 The permeate flux for the membrane filtration of CMC solutions increased considerably in the presence of ultrasonication, as indicated in The ultrasonic defouling of the reverse osmosis membrane in the CMC solution can also be observed from images of the morphologies of the membrane surfaces. The difference in the surface morphology of the membrane fouled with 1000 As can be seen from On-line ultrasonic defouling of the polyamide-based reverse osmosis membranes used in this investigation resulted in a significant increase in the permeate flux, with virtually no loss in rejection. On average, the permeate flux increased by approximately 50.8% for a 500
