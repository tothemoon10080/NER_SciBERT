A general flotation circuit modeling framework has been developed. A robust and accurate flotation circuit model will be very useful for exploring flowsheet options, assisting in the correction of operational issues, comparing the performance of pilot- and full-sized plants, optimisation and control and plant design, among others.
                  The framework is capable of fitting rate parameters, solving circuit mass- and volume balances and simulating the behavior of a specific ore in different circuits. This allows the researcher to explore various modeling options without concerns for the accuracy of the mass balance.
                  The framework was tested on a data set generated as part of pilot plant experimentation. The regressed parameters were used to simulate various flowsheet configurations and sizing options. The framework proved to be a versatile tool for simulating changes to the flotation circuit configuration.
