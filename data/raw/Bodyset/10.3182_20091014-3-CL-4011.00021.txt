In order to achieve an effective control and monitoring of an ore processing process the reliable and continuous express-analysis of the chemical composition of concentration products is rather essential. At the Mining-Processing Enterprise Erdenet (Mongolia) the following methods are applied depending on conditions: the analysis of run-of-mine ore on the conveyer, the analysis of ground feed in the flotation pulp and the analysis of dewatered concentration products on the conveyer. The continuous monitoring of ore composition and quality, as well as the solid phase of the pulp allows optimizing the operation of the mining-transport subdivision, to control the concentration process and to realize the optimizing quality of the concentrates to be shipped. For continuous chemical analysis of ore and concentration products, X-ray-fluorescence analyzers Amdel-ISA-MEP (firm TGM, Australia) and RA-931 (firm «Elskort», Russia) were selected for the widest application.
