The slurry level in AG/SAG and ball mills has an influence on their power draw, which in some instances can be profound. This is particularly the case with so-called slurry pooling in AG/SAG mills which can result in significant lowering of power draw. From a predictive viewpoint there are currently no published models that explicitly describe the influence of slurry level on power draw and the relationship between slurry level, slurry flow and pulp lifter design. Citic SMCC Process Technology Pty Ltd has developed such a model and in this paper its structure is described. Examples are given of both AG/SAG and ball mills of how the model responds to changes in slurry level. These examples are used to explain the observed phenomena of slurry pooling and the decrease in power draw observed in ball mills after start-up when feed is first introduced into the mill.If one looks back over the last 70 As per Morrell’s original model structure, the grinding media part of the charge (rocks and/or ball) is configured as per The approach adopted in the Citic SMCC model to handle the slurry phase is to predict its power draw separately to the grinding media phase (balls/rocks), then add the powers of each phase together to obtain the total power draw. Using an energy balance approach, where power is taken to be the rate at which potential and kinetic energy is imparted to the charge, Eq.              The density of the pulp phase (  Jt Jb    The parameter   Jt The fit of Eq. Eq. In practice the only power draw that is usually measured in full scale plants is the metered or gross power, ie motor input power. The difference between motor input and net power draw in a mill is due to losses associated with various electrical and mechanical components. The main losses occur in the motor, gearing and bearings. None of these remains constant over the mill’s full operating range. Some, however, may have a fixed component – for example, losses in the bearings due to friction will be dictated by the weight of the mill when empty (a fixed component, though even this will vary as liners and lifters wear) and the weight of the mill charge (a variable component). In most, if not all, full-scale operating plants the only data that will be measured is gross power and/or current. In rare cases no-load power (the gross power drawn by the mill when running empty) will be known from commissioning or maintenance records. Alternatively, if the mill has been emptied for relining, the no-load power is sometimes recorded at start-up. Such data indicate the magnitude of some of the power-loss components. Given the need to properly validate the model through comparison of measured and predicted values, the power model must also predict motor input power. Therefore to do so the Citic SMCC model is configured as follows:       Clearly to solve the integral in Eq. In the vast majority of situations mills are operated in a “normal” regime, eg the AG/SAG mill does not have a slurry pool or the ball mill slurry flowrate is the result of a recycle load which is not excessive. In such cases good predictive results can be obtained by setting As mentioned in the previous section, providing the mill is operating in a reasonably normal manner, simple approximations of the extent and position of the slurry phase lead to good predictions of the power draw. However, there are situations where, for various reasons, mills operate under unusual conditions and as a result their power response is atypical. The challenge in modelling power draw, apart from accurately describing the slurry phase influence on power draw where the slurry volume is known, is to predict the slurry phase volume in the first instance from information on the design of the mill and the slurry flowrate out of the mill. A relationship between slurry flow and slurry volume (so-called hold up) is therefore required. Citic SMCC’s slurry flow model for AG/SAG mills (grate discharge mills) was constructed using the approach originally adopted by          The value of    The parameter values     The parameters in the above equations were fitted to over 760 laboratory and pilot mill data sets and 19 full scale mill data sets. The fit of the equations to the full-scale mill data sets are shown in Once the slurry hold-up has been estimated using Eqs. As the mill was operating under slurry pool conditions, increasing flowrate decreased power draw. If the mill did not have a slurry pool in the first instance this response may not have occurred. An overflow mill can be considered as a special case of a grate discharge mill in which the grates have no holes (or all of the holes are blocked) and slurry builds up until it overflows out of the discharge trunnion. At this point The slurry level will vary with flow of slurry into and out of the mill, a higher level resulting from a higher flow. The slurry level can be estimated by making the simplifying assumption that the discharge trunnion behaves like a rectangular section, broad crested weir ( By applying the Bernoulli equation to such a weir of width The volumetric discharge rate ( For maximum discharge By differentiating Eq. By substituting for To maintain the same cross-sectional area and maximum vertical height as the mill discharge trunnion, b must be set to With reference to By substituting Eq. These equations are theoretical and relate to inviscid flow. In practice slurries are far from inviscid in behaviour. Empirical corrections to Eq. The validity of these equations is illustrated using the data from The behaviour of the slurry phase in tumbling mills influences their power draw. Whereas in some instances this influence is relatively minor, in other cases it can be profound. For a power model to be truly effective, therefore, this response must be adequately described. Citic SMCC’s power does so by describing the power draw of the slurry phase separately to the grinding media, then adds the values to give the overall power. This is in contrast to other published models which do not consider the slurry phase at all. The volume occupied by the slurry phase is dictated by the design of the discharge system, the volume of grinding media and the slurry flowrate. The Citic SMCC model utilises equations which initially predict the volume of the slurry phase then uses this information to predict its position and motion in relation to the grinding media phase. The model has been tested using a large volume of operational data and has been demonstrated to provide very accurate results.
