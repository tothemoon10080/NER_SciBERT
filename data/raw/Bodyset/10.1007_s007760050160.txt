The mineral density and atomic numbers of elements in the periosteal callus and the cortex area of a healing fracture were measured by quantitative computerized tomography (QCT) to obtain accurate information on the mineralization process in rabbit tibia. The mineral density of the periosteal callus was highest on day 15 and decreased gradually throughout the experiment. This was initially detected by QCT, but not with conventional radiography. An apparent decrease in cortical bone density on days 28 and 42 after fracture was observed. Atomic numbers of elements in the cortex remained stable, indicating a possible homeostatic mechanism of mineral preservation at the fracture callus and involved cortical area. QCT may predict density alterations in the fracture callus more accurately than conventional X-ray. Further studies are essential to predict a relationship between mineral density, atomic numbers, and mechanical stability.
