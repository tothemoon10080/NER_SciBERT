Microstructure and tensile behavior of CoCrFeNi2.1Nbx (x = 0.2, 0.4) high entropy alloys were investigated in the as-cast and aged (800 °C/24 h) conditions. Increasing Nb addition increased strength but reduced ductility due to the increased volume fraction of Laves phase. On aging, fine acicular precipitates formed throughout the matrix in the CoCrFeNi2.1Nb0.4 alloy, but only at the dendrite boundaries in the CoCrFeNi2.1Nb0.2 alloy. While both the aged alloys showed increase in strength due to the presence of the fine precipitates, the favorable microstructure of the CoCrFeNi2.1Nb0.2 ensured a larger mean free path for gliding dislocations, thus rendering superior strength-ductility synergy.High entropy alloys (HEAs) are multicomponent alloys developed based on the novel alloy design approach of mixing a large number of components (≥5) in equiatomic or near equiatomic concentrations Nevertheless, the role of high entropy might be overemphasized so that a large number of HEAs contain different intermetallics Button-shaped melts (∼50 mm × 8 mm) of CoCrFeNi A field emission gun scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM) (JSM-7800F) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was used for microstructure and compositional analyses. The phase analysis was performed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEM-2100, 200 kV). TEM Samples were prepared by electropolishing (temperature: −10 °C; voltage: 20 V; electrolyte: mixture (1:9) of perchloric acid + ethanol). Tensile properties were determined by using a universal testing machine (INSTRON-5967) at ambient temperature with an initial strain rate of 10  The aged Nb The as-cast Nb  The increase in volume fraction of the Laves phase with increasing Nb addition in the present HEAs agrees well with the previous reports While the precipitation of D0 Remarkably, the ε-phase preferentially precipitates close to dendrite boundaries in the Nb The increase in strength of the as-cast high-Nb alloy (Nb The effect of aging on microstructure and tensile properties of CoCrFeNi None declared.
