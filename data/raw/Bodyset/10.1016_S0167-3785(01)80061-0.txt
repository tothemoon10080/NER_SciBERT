 Segregation is a general term for separating different items from each other, and keeping them separate. In political terms the well-known apartheid system that existed in South Africa for several years was a system based on segregation of the different races of people. As was the case for the majority of the people in South Africa, segregation causes adverse effects in the majority of cases, and is something one would wish to avoid in most situations. As will be understood, segregation of powders is the common term used for the separation of particles of different properties that often takes place during handling, transportation and storage of particulate solids, or powders. The most well known example of segregation may be the segregation that takes place during filling of powders in heaps. During the build up of a heap, the coarser or rounder particles easily roll all the way to the edge of the heap, whereas the finer and non spherical particles do not move so easily, and therefore are collected near the filling point. Typical other examples of situations where segregation takes place, are filling and emptying of silos, transport on belt conveyors, transport by train or trucks, mixing, tumbling, and filling in large heaps for storage. Segregation will affect all industries handling particulate solids, from the pharmaceutical industry handling a few kilograms, to the mining industry handling thousands of tons every day. It leads to variations in size distributions, destroys mixtures, and causes other kinds of inhomogeneities, all of which will have significant effects on the economics of production. Although segregation has been a theme of research since early this century [ Traditionally heap segregation has been regarded as one of the main segregation mechanisms. However, Mosby [ The first key for evaluating how likely segregation is to take place in a certain situation, lies in an estimation of what differences there are between the particles. For that purpose an overview of various particle properties that can lead to segregation is of great importance. Particles with identical properties will not segregate, but as soon as there are differences, segregation may, and probably will, take place. Following the definition, segregation of particulate solids is the separation of particles of different properties into different parts of the handling equipment. Properties that give rise to such segregation are          In the same powder, there may be particles ranging from 1 µm to 1 mm, which is a factor of 1000 in difference. Even larger variations are common. None of the other parameters can vary so much. Size is therefore responsible for segregation more often than any of the other parameters listed here. The wider the size distribution is, the more segregation there will be. Also the coarser the particles are, the more segregation one can expect. If there are too few fines to fill the voids between the coarse particles, there is a lot more segregation than if there are enough fines to fill the voids completely.        The most important mechanisms that may be responsible for segregation during filling of particulate solids onto a heap, are probably the following:         The The       The most common mechanisms responsible for heap segregation are probably rolling, sieving, and air current and fluidisation segregation, but the other mechanisms are also important in some cases. The same mechanisms may be active also in other situations. In addition, there are also some mechanisms which are usually not active during filling of heaps,           The segregation that occurred during   The overview that has been given of the most important mechanisms, as well as of the corresponding situations in which segregation may take place, has been based on literature, and on experimental investigations by means of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional segregation testers [ Many testers have been described previously in literature [ The two-dimensional tester consists of a box with a front wall in glass and a back wall in aluminium. The smallest version has a depth of 7 cm, and the length of the sloping surface of the heap is 63 cm. Initial testing in testers of different depths were carried out to check the wall effects, and it was found that 7 cm in depth was the minimum needed to make the results independent on the depth of the tester, indicating negligible wall effects. The tester is equipped with 9 sample takers situated along a straight line, which by adjustments of the tester is made parallel to the angle of repose of the powder to be tested. The sample takers consist of cylindrical tubes, which can be pushed through holes in the back wall of the tester. The tubes slide on cylindrical plugs fixed to the back wall with frames, as shown by the detailed drawing in When the tester has been filled well above the sample takers, the tubes are pushed through the powder mass until they are in contact with the front glass. In this position the tester is emptied, and the samples can be collected one by one by pulling the tubes back to their original position. By analysing the samples, the segregation that has taken place along the slope, can be determined. When the sampling tubes are pushed through the powder mass, it is difficult to avoid some percolation of fine particles through the voids between the coarse particles. Some of the fines will therefore percolate out from the lower part of the sampling volume, and at the same time some will percolate into the volume from the top. The two amounts are likely to be approximately equal, reducing the net effect of this disturbance to an acceptable level. It is believed that this sampling technique will give the most accurate results that are possible to obtain. To get reliable results, it is extremely important that the mass that is filled into the tester is homogeneous. Many tests have been carried out on mixtures of sand (mean size around 500 µm) and alumina (mean size around 100 µm), and to ensure a constant mixing ratio, the two components have been fed into a static mixer at the desired mixing ratio. From the static mixer the mixture falls directly into the tester, forming one half of a heap. The mixtures obtained in this way are very homogeneous, and the reproducibility of the tests carried out in this way, is extremely good.  For all the curves shown in For curves B and C the content of alumina is not high enough to cause fluidisation segregation, but there is enough to fill the voids between the sand particles. Hence the sieving mechanism is not active, but the rolling and perhaps the displacement mechanisms are causing reduction of the content of alumina along the slope. In the case of curve C, with the lowest initial mixing ratio, there is a sudden drop in content of alumina close to the edge of the heap. Here perhaps the content of alumina has become low enough for the sieving mechanism to take over. For curves D and E the content of alumina is not enough to fill the voids between the sand particles. Therefore the sieving mechanism is dominating for these curves. The initial increase of alumina for curve D is quite typical for this segregation mechanism, and also the sharp drop in content of alumina after this maximum has been passed. Close to the edge of the heap there is no more alumina left in any of these curves.  Three-dimensional testers were also developed and used both by Mosby [ In Unfortunately, it seems that segregation seldom can be avoided completely, but it seems that, when the reasons why it occurs are understood, it will be possible to reduce it to a level where the adverse effects are acceptable in most cases. In principle there are three main possibilities for reduction of segregation problems. First, one can try to The basic idea for Alternatively the small particles may be  In  If the silo is a  Alternatively, segregation during filling can be counteracted by distributed filling, which may be achieved by means of china hats, by several filling points, or by various moving equipment that can move the filling point around a large part of the horizontal cross section of the silo. This will prevent different fractions from being collected in different parts of the silo. Use of silos of small diameters will also cause less segregation than silos of larger diameters. Other modifications such as antisegregation filling pipes, tangential entries etc., have been investigated at Tel-Tek, showing positive effects. Finally, the Another possibility is to These are some examples of what can be done in some specific situations to reduce segregation problems. Generally the main idea is to identify the segregation mechanisms that will be active in a given situation, and to avoid equipment or operations where these mechanisms may come into play. If a mixture is to be made of a fine and a coarse powder that will give percolation and sieving segregation, tumbling mixers creating sloping surfaces should be avoided. Other mixers applying more of the convection mixing mechanisms would be preferable, and also continuous mixing at the point where the mixture is needed, would be a great advantage.  Segregation of particulate solids is a problem that hardly can be totally avoided. However. if the underlying mechanisms causing segregation in given situations are properly understood, it will in most cases be possible to reduce the problems to a tolerable level. With the handbook on segregation that is now available, it is easier than before to get hold of information required for reducing given problems. With continuing research going on in the field better and better information will be available in the future, making it possible to even further reduce the segregation problems.
