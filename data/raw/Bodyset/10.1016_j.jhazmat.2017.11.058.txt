Hierarchical porous SiO2-AlOOH composite nanosheets (HPSA) with a three-dimensional (3D) structure were prepared from two-dimensional (2D) layered mineral kaolinite (A12Si2O5(OH)4) via a template-free structural reorganization method. The obtained material was subjected to homogeneous and effective amino-functionalization by grafting it with (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane. Owing to the enhanced 3D hierarchical meso-macroporous structure containing highly dispersed protonated amino groups (NH3
                     +), the as-prepared amino-functionalized HPSA (NH2-HPSA) showed unique adsorption performance towards the congo red anionic dye. It provides feasibilities to fabricate other functional hierarchical porous materials from clay minerals, which can offer potential applications in adsorption, separation, catalysis and other environmental remediation fields.The presence of toxic organic dyes (such as congo red, rhodamine B, and methylene blue) and heavy metal ions (such as Cr Recently, hierarchical porous materials have attracted significant attention as prospective functionalized materials In this work, novel hierarchical porous SiO Natural kaolinite (A1 X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a Bruker-AXS D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (0.15406 Batch congo red dye adsorption tests were performed using a traditional bottle-point method. The detailed experimental procedure can be described as follows. 50 The sorption isotherms of the HPSA and NH Sorption kinetic tests were performed at 25 To evaluate the regeneration properties of NH Congo red concentrations were measured at λ The schematic illustration of the preparation of HPSA composite nanosheets and NH The resulting hierarchical porous SiO As indicated by the XRD patterns (Fig. S1), the as-received kaolinite corresponded to kaolinite-1A (JCPDS 14–0164) containing trace impurities of alunite (KAl The SEM images of the sample powders and STEM images of the samples pre-dispersed in the liquid phase are shown in To further characterize the thickness and roughness of the nanosheets structure, AFM topographic images of kaolinite and NH  In order to study the thermal properties of NH The incorporation of amino groups into the HPSA framework can be qualitatively described by the FTIR spectra depicted in To further clarify the effect produced by the amino functional groups, XPS analysis was performed. The C 1s spectra of the HPSA and NH It is well known that the amino groups ( The obtained sorption isotherms ( Kinetic experiments were conducted by measuring the contents of congo red in solution at various time intervals. NH To further investigate the adsorption characteristics of NH Adsorption kinetics was carried out to evaluate the rate and mechanism of the dye molecules transfer from the liquid solution onto the NH Based on the characterization, adsorption performance, and adsorption isotherm and kinetics model analysis, the enhanced adsorption property of NH In summary, novel hierarchical porous HPSA nanosheets with a 3D structure were obtained from kaolinite using the template-free structural reorganization method. In particular, this 3D hierarchical meso-macroporous structure was formed through the innovative self-formation approach based on the chemical properties of Al hydroxides and 2D nanosheet morphology of natural kaolinite. After that, a novel grafting method was developed for the homogeneous and effective amino-functionalization of HPSA, resulting in the formation of the enhanced 3D hierarchical porous structure and highly dispersed protonated amino groups ( This work was supported by the Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at The following is Supplementary data to this article:
