Aluminum metal-matrix nanocomposites (AMMNCs) fabricated by conventional stir-casting process usually show high porosity and poor distribution of nanoparticles within the matrix. In the current study, for the improvement of nanoparticles distribution in the aluminum matrix and enhancement of the mechanical properties, a mixture of Al/nano-Al2O3 powders were injected by pure argon gas into the molten 7075 aluminum alloy and this mixture was extruded at high temperature. Mechanical behavior of the final product was investigated by tensile and compression tests, hardness measurements, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) and Optical Microscopy. This nanocomposite exhibited some superior properties such as a fine grain microstructure and a reasonable uniform distribution of nanoparticles in the matrix. Mechanical experiments results confirmed that the addition of Al2O3 nanoparticles and the extrusion process effectively improved ultimate tensile strength, compression strength and hardness. In next step, we used a Preference Selection Index (PSI) materials selection method to select best combination of strength and workability of Al7075Al2O3 nanocomposites. By this method, extruded Al7075/0.4 and 0.8 wt % Al2O3 has best combination of strength and workability.Aluminum alloy 7075, a cold finished aluminum wrought product, has the highest strength of all aluminum screw machine alloys. Because of its extremely high strength, this alloy is used for highly stressed structural parts including aircraft fittings, gears and shafts and various other commercial aircraft, aerospace and transportation equipment Aluminum metal matrix nanocomposites reinforced with ceramic particulates provide intrinsic characteristics including high specific strength, high thermal conductivity, low coefficient of thermal expansion, creep and fatigue resistance that make them ideal candidates for aerospace and transportation industries Powder metallurgy, stir casting and squeeze casting are three conventional approaches for the production of aluminum/ceramic composites and each one is accompanied with its privileges and drawbacks However, there are some problems associated with stir-casting of MMCs such as, poor wettability, agglomeration and non-homogeneous distribution of the reinforcement in matrix Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are used to salve of problems in the presence of multiple conflicting criteria and divided by two main groups, multi objective decision making (MODM) and multiple attribute decision making (MADM) techniques In this study, we employed a novel fabrication method for manufacturing of products, including injection of Al/Al In A7075/Al Aluminum matrix nanocomposites were produced by combinational stir-casting process ( After production of the composite casting bars, for improvement of mechanical properties, the extrusion process was carried out by a hydraulic press with the maximum load capacity of 25 ton at constant speed of 50 mm/min, and the extrusion ratio (η= (D The experimental density of the composites was measured by the Archimedean method by weighing a small cylindrical pieces of the composites first in air and then in water. The theoretical densities of the composites were calculated using the mixture rule while the known densities of the matrix and Al  The optical images of nanocomposites with 0.4 and 1.2 wt % Al  Also, in The influence of nanoparticles content and extrusion process on the hardness, tensile and compressive stress and ductility is shown in It can be observed that with addition of 1.2 wt % nanoparticles, ultimate strength of AA7075 increase from 120 MPa to 400 MPa. The increase of strength and hardness can be attributed to the grain refining and particle strengthening, load bearing and mismatch strengthening by nanoparticles. The contribution of load-bearing effect is very small in the nanocomposites With application of hot extrusion process, an improvement in ultimate strength and especially in nanocomposite with 1.2 wt % Al  The detailed steps involved in the PSI method described by Maniya and Bhatt   A = {A  If the attribute is non-beneficial type (i.e. density), then the original attribute performance value can be normalized as follows:  To get the preference variation value, it is required to find the mean value of normalized data of attribute j,  Moreover, the total overall preference value of all the attributes should be one, i.e. Σφ   Selection of a composite with the highest strength and ductility among the proposed Al7075 The attribute measures are normalized to convert in compatible unit using Eq. Finally, the alternative materials based on PSI method can be arranged in descending order as A7075/Al The porosity content of nanocomposite increased with increasing alumina weight percentage and decreased with application of extrusion process. Microstructure results show that the injection of Al/Al The addition of nanoparticles and application of extrusion process effectively increased mechanical properties of A7075 aluminum alloy. The changes in ductility of the nanocomposites in as-cast and extruded state were dependent to the variations in alumina content, porosity and grain size.
