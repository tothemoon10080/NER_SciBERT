Dear Sir, How do bacteria interact with minerals? This is the title of the most recent paper published on this subject in which its author concludes by the following statement, “This is a compelling evidence that the only role of bacteria is the oxidation of ferrous ions and sulfur” ( It seems, however, that there is agreement that the rate of dissolution of sulfide minerals by bacterial action is approximately proportional to the solubility product of the sulfide concerned as expressed recently by It is evident that the nearer the microorganism is to the sulfide surface the more effective will be the action of the metabolic products on the S In summary, there is no transfer of electrons, the breaking of bonds in the mineral is due to the forces of hydration, and the process is the addition of oxygen atoms to the lone pairs of electrons on the hydrated sulfide ion, a reaction that is catalyzed by bacterial metabolic products.
