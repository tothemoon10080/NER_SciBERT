Osteodistraction is a clinical reality available for the resolution of bone deficiencies before dental implant placement or in cases where the existing implants are at the wrong position. The objective of this study is to suggest a new possibility for bone distraction, based on tooth-implant bone distractors, in areas were there is the need for extensive alveolar bone recovery, with installed dental implants. This technique presented good results associated with its simplicity and low cost, making it a viable clinical solution for bone tissue augmentation. Although its use is recent, the suggested technique shows the potential to become used widely in attempts to achieve bone-height augmentation, primarily when dental implants are installed and osteointegrated already.
