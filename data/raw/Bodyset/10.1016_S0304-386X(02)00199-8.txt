The possibility of leaching bastnaesite pre-concentrate in dilute sulphuric acid solutions at 25 °C was studied. For this purpose, unroasted and roasted bastnaesite pre-concentrates were leached with 100 mL of 1–3 M H2SO4 and H2SO4+thiourea solutions at 25 °C with a liquid/solid ratio of 20 mL/g for 6 h. Roasting affected the dissolution behaviour of rare earths in H2SO4 solution and dissolution of total rare-earth elements (REEs) was increased from 8.5% to 47.4%. The addition of thiourea to the leaching medium further increased the dissolution of the rare-earth elements in the unroasted and especially in the roasted pre-concentrate due to the reduction of cerium (IV) to cerium (III) by thiourea, thus increasing the cerium dissolution value from 22.8% to 93.0%, which in turn increased the total dissolution of REEs from 17.6% to 89.0%. Thus, it was possible to precipitate 93.6% (CeO2=92.4%, La2O3=93.2%, Nd2O3=98.4%) of total REEs in the filtrate and the total REO content of the precipitate was determined as 92.6% (CeO2=58%, La2O3=29%, Nd2O3=5.6%).Bastnaesite is one of the main sources of rare earths and marketable bastnaesite concentrate of 60% rare-earth oxides (REO) is produced by gravity and magnetic separation or by flotation In previous works, leaching characteristics of Kızılcaören bastnaesite pre-concentrate were tested and best results were obtained with 15 M H Thiourea has been extensively tested as an extracting agent for gold and silver in ores Since dilute sulphuric acid leaching of bastnaesite ores and concentrates is not practiced and no study has been reported on the dissolution characteristics of rare earths in aqueous sulphuric acid–thiourea medium, this study was aimed at investigating the effect of thiourea on dilute sulphuric acid dissolution of Ce, La and Nd from unroasted and roasted Kızılcaören bastnaesite pre-concentrate. Representative samples taken from the Kızılcaören deposit were crushed to −5.6 mm and the composite sample with the chemical composition given in  A 250-mL three-necked Pyrex reactor equipped with a thermometer and a thermocouple to maintain the temperature within ±0.5 °C was used in the leaching experiments. One hundred milliliters of solvent and 5 g of sample was added to the reaction vessel and the mixture was stirred at a rate of 450 min As it was possible to dissolve rare-earth elements in bastnaesite concentrates in 2.5 M HCl solution La, Ce, Nd, Pr and Ca analyses in solutions were conducted by Smatzu-2000 ICP spectrometer. Barium and high concentration rare-earth elements were analyzed by gravimetric methods based on sulphate and oxalate precipitation, respectively, and thiourea was determined by potassium iodate titration Unroasted and roasted pre-concentrates were leached with 100 mL of 1–3 M H In order to test the effect of thiourea concentration on leaching, experiments were performed using roasted pre-concentrate at 25 °C for 6 h with a liquid/solid ratio of 20 mL/g in 1 M H The effect of liquid/solid ratio on dissolution was determined in 1 M H Considering the 1 M thiourea concentration, leaching experiments were performed using unroasted and roasted pre-concentrates in H The filtrate obtained from the leaching experiment of roasted pre-concentrate ([H The residues obtained after leaching experiments performed with 3 M H XRD patterns of the H As is verified by XRD analysis The addition of thiourea to the leaching medium increases the dissolution of total rare-earth elements in the unroasted and especially in the roasted pre-concentrate reaching a dissolution value of 89.0%. This effect is more pronounced with the roasted sample due to the reduction of cerium (IV) to cerium (III) by thiourea, which in turn is converted into [(NH As the decomposition of thiourea or [(NH After roasting of bastnaesite concentrates, it is not possible to dissolve cerium with HCl, H Although it was possible to dissolve 89.3% and precipitate 97.8% of total REEs in 15 M H The total REO content of the precipitates obtained in 15 M H
