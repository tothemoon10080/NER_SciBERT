The mechanical reliability of solder joints is influenced by a layer of Cu6Sn5 intermetallics (IMC) present at the interface of tin-based solders/Cu substrates. We have discovered that the mechanical properties of hexagonal Cu6Sn5 are strongly related to the crystal orientation, using Electron Back Scattered Diffraction (EBSD) and nanoindentation on unidirectionally solidified Snâ€“4wt% Cu with/without 0.05wt% Ni. This fundamental discovery on the anisotropic mechanical properties of Cu6Sn5 may find practical applications in designing soldering processes to obtain preferred IMC orientations.An intermetallic compound (IMC) of Cu Ni is an important alloying element in Sn-based lead-free solders Previously, we have found that there was a large variation in properties (high standard deviation) in Ni containing (Cu,Ni) In this research, therefore, the relationship between the mechanical properties of hardness and elastic modulus and the crystal orientation of Cu Cu In In In The hardness of Cu The relationship between crystal orientation and mechanical properties of Cu The authors would like to thank Mr J.
