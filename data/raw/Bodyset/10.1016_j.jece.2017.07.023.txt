The present work aims at determining the experimental conditions for the recovery of zinc from leach liquors, produced through dilute sulphuric acid leaching of electric arc furnace dust (EAFD), at atmospheric pressure. Zn can be recovered as an easily filterable precipitate. More specifically, zinc was precipitated by 99.5% with the form of a mixed white fine crystalline powder, comprising of hydrozincite (3ΖnCO3
                     .3Zn(OH)2) and zinc carbonate hydroxide hydrate (ZnCO3
                     .3Zn(OH)2
                     .H2O). Zn precipitation was carried out in a pH range of 6.5–7 at 25°C. The addition of different types of carbonated salts, such as sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate or ammonium carbonate, either with the form of suspensions or as solids, was investigated. The produced precipitates were characterized through means of particle size distribution analysis, chemical analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric/differential analyses (TG-DTA) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), whereas their microstructure and morphological characteristics were studied by scanning and transmission electron and microscopy (SEM/TEM). High grade zinc precipitates were obtained, as manganese concentrations did not exceed 1%, whereas traces of Cr, Cu and Pb were also detected.Industrial steelmaking worldwide (i.e. molten iron production with 0.02 to 2 According to the World Steel Association (WSA), the production of steel from BOF in 2015 reached 75% of total steel production, whereas the rest has been covered by EAF steelmaking The chemical composition of the electric arc furnace dusts produced during the melting process depends on several factors, such as the type of the used scrap, the types of the deoxidation additives, the types of the fluxes used for the adjustment of the bath temperature, etc. As a result the final dust synthesis usually presents strong variations both in chemical composition (Zn: 8.0–33.0%, Fe: 24.0–45.5%, Ca: 0.9–3.4%, Pb: 0.2–5.6%, Cr: 0.0–0.5%, Mn: 1.68–4.2%, Si: 0.35–2.5%, Cd: 0.0–0.12%, Ni: 0.0–0.1%, Cu: 0.2–0.4%) and in the contained mineralogical phases (ZnO, Fe The Laboratory of Metallurgy of the National Technical University of Athens has developed a novel integrated hydrometallurgical process, as an alternative to the disposal of EAF dust in hazardous waste landfills, aiming at the dust’s valorisation, recovering the contained valuable metals through various stages of leaching, thus converting the initially hazardous waste into a residue suitable to be fed to cement industry The recovery of zinc from the leach liquors by chemical precipitation, as zinc carbonate, can be carried out by the addition of carbonate or bicarbonate salts, which are very strong electrolytes and therefore, they are completely diverged when they are dissolved. They produced carbonate anions which can be further hydrolyzed, generating hydroxyl anions that are responsible for the alkaline nature of their solutions. The published literature has given little attention to the zinc recovery by chemical precipitation as carbonate salts from EAFD sulphate zincferous leach liquors. Mitchell developed and patented a method for Zn chemical precipitation, as zinc carbonate, from concentrated zinc sulphate solutions The present investigation presents the results of a research study involving the recovery of zinc with the form of basic zinc carbonate hydrates precipitates, from purified zincferous leach liquors, using sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and ammonium carbonate as precipitating agents. The precipitates produced at the optimum conditions were characterized through means of particle size distribution analysis, chemical analysis, XRD, TG-DTA, FT-IR, SEM and TEM. The solution used for the recovery of zinc as a basic carbonate salt was a real leach liquor, produced by a two stage leaching of EAFD, with dilute sulphuric acid, at 25 Precipitation experiments were carried out in a 500 Chemical analyses of the produced precipitates were conducted using X-ray Fluorescence (Spectro–Xepos) and atomic absorption spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer 4100). Their particle size distributions were identified by an ultrasonic-assisted Mastersizer 2000 (Malvern) particle size analyser. Mineralogical phases were determined using a Bruker D8-Focus X-ray diffractometer with nickel-filtered CuKa radiation (λ Preliminary test were conducted using a synthetic solution in order to examine zinc precipitation under various conditions, studying different factors, such as the type of the carbonate precipitating agent (i.e. the different source of carbonate radicals), the form of the precipitation agent addition (i.e. solid or saturated solutions), the range of the concentration values of the precipitation agent in relation with the corresponding zinc in the solution, and finally the evolution rate of the precipitation reaction. Parameters that were kept constant were the initial zinc concentration (6.0 According to the results, presented in  More specifically (NH4) In the case of sodium carbonate, complete Zn removal from sulphate solutions was accomplished approximately within 120 According to the results, complete recovery of Zn as a carbonate salt, was accomplished after 180 Based on the preliminary experiments results, using synthetic zinc sulphate solutions, the optimum conditions for Zn recovery from zincferous leach liquors of electric arc furnaces dust at 25 The chemical analysis of the produced precipitate is shown in The particle size distribution of the basic zinc carbonate precipitate produced from purified EAFD leach liquor is presented in The basic carbonate nature of the zinc precipitate was also confirmed and by the FT-IR, whose spectra is given in The results of the precipitate thermal analysis by TG-DTA are shown in The above observations were also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy ( Microscopic examination also revealed the presence of even larger compact spherical or plate-shaped structures (50100 The results obtained in the present research work have shown that zinc can be quantitatively precipitated from purified EAFD zincferous leach liquors, at ambient temperature, as an easily filterable carbonate precipitate. Zinc precipitation was accomplished by gradually adding the precipitating agent in the pH range of 7–7.5. Zn recovery reached 99.5% by using: Precipitating Agent: Na
