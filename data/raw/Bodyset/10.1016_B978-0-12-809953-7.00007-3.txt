This chapter presents alternative pretreatment technologies, such as sand separation, sedimentation, and dissolved air flotation (DAF), which are applied for removal of large-size suspended solids contained in the source water. Such technologies are mainly used for saline source waters with high content of suspended settleable or floatable solids, and they aim to reduce the turbidity in the source water down to less than 5NTU so this water can be treated efficiently and cost-effectively by downstream filtration facilities prior to reverse osmosis desalination. The chapter contains key design criteria commonly used for sizing of lamella settlers and DAF clarifiers and provides construction cost curves for these facilities.Design flow rate, m Turbidity, NTU SDI Algal content, cells/L 127,910 (33.8 0.5–80 6–16 <20,000 Ferric chloride, mg/L Cationic polymer, mg/L Sulfuric acid, mg/L—target pH—6.7 15 (0.5–50 0.5 (0.0–1.0 8 (0–30 Number of settler tanks Number of lamella modules per tank Width of lamella modules, m (ft) Length of lamella modules, m (ft) Depth of lamella modules, m (ft) Net surface area per lamella module Surface loading rate/module area Setter tank surface area Settler tank surface loading rate Water depth 4 4 1.24(4.1 8.67 (28.4 2.588 (9.8 235 1.42 43 7.7 5.5 Design flow rate, m Turbidity, NTU SDI 127,910 (33.8 0.5–80 6–16 Ferric chloride, mg/L Cationic polymer, mg/L Sulfuric acid, mg/L – Target pH – 6.7 15 (0.5–50 0.5 (0.0–1.0 8 (0–30 Number per DAF tank Total number Width, m (ft) Length, m (ft) Depth, m (ft) Number of mixers per tank Total retention time 1 6 4.85 (15.9 8.0 (26.4 4.9 (16.1 2 13 Number Width, m (ft) Length, m (ft) Depth, m (ft) Total surface area Surface contact zone area Surface flotation area Surface loading rate @ 15% recycle 6 4.85 (15.9 10.0 (32.8 4.9 (16.1 291 57 234 26.2 Number Capacity Delivery head 6 133 7 Number Capacity Delivery pressure 6 15 10 Number Capacity per tank Net volume per tank 6 100 4 Introduction Sand Removal Systems Settling Canals and Retention Basins Strainers Cyclone Separators Sedimentation Tanks Introduction Conventional Sedimentation Tanks Lamella Sedimentation Tanks Lamella Settler—Design Example Dissolved Air Flotation Clarifiers Introduction Planning and Design Considerations DAF—Design Example Construction Costs of Lamella Settlers and DAF Clarifiers References The purpose of sand removal, sedimentation, and dissolved flotation pretreatment systems is to minimize the content of coarse materials such as grit, debris, and suspended solids collected by the plant intake and protect downstream filtration facilities from solids' overload. The source water collected by onshore intakes and shallow open offshore intakes usually does not contain large quantities of sand but could have elevated content of floating and suspended solids. Well intakes typically have a very low content of suspended Well-designed desalination plant intakes usually produce source water of low sand and silt content. Therefore, most desalination plants do not have separate sand removal facilities. Small quantities or sand and coarse silt contained in the source water are typically retained by the plant sedimentation or filtration facilities. However, in locations where desalination plant's open intake is located adjacent to an area of significant ship traffic, of turbulent underwater currents, or in area where frequent dredging activities occur, a large amount of sand and silt may enter the desalination plant continuously and would need to be removed in separate facilities. Sand removal facilities may or may not be followed by sedimentation basins. If the saline source water contains low level of turbidity but large amount of sand, than construction of grit removal facilities instead of clarifiers is more appropriate and cost-effective. Some large onshore intakes are designed with long canal that delivers the source water into retention basin where the water is presettled and sand and large debris are accumulated. The source water from the retention basin overflows into the forebay of the screening facilities/intake pump station of the desalination plant from where it is conveyed into the main pretreatment system. Such canals and retention basins are dredged periodically or are equipped with sediment removal/flushing systems to minimize solids accumulation over time. While such retention reservoir configurations are suitable for dampening the effect of heavy rain events, winds, currents, ship traffic, and other sources of elevated content of solids in the source water, they may present problems such as excessive algae accumulation, especially if the flow velocity is relatively low and the water remains in the reservoirs for a long time. Usually, it is more prudent and cost-effective to build an offshore intake with depth of at least 8 Depending on the size of the desalination plant, grit removal facilities most widely used in practice are 200–500-μm strainers ( Strainers are typically applied for small- and medium-size desalination plants [i.e., plants of capacity of 20,000 Cyclone separators have found application for removal of sand from groundwater, especially for small desalination plants. In such systems the inlet pressure from the intake well pumps drives the source water into the top of the separator chamber at a tangent, causing rotation and formation of vortex in the center of the separator. The vortex action forces the separation of heavy particles from the water. These particles accumulate at the bottom in a collection chamber from where they are periodically removed. In most recent desalination plant designs, cyclone separators and strainers are replaced by microscreens described in Sedimentation is typically used upstream of granular media and membrane filters when the membrane-plant source water has daily average turbidity higher than 30 Sedimentation basins for saline source water pretreatment should be designed to produce settled water with turbidity of less than 2.0 If the source water turbidity exceeds 50 It is important to note that sedimentation tanks do not remove oil, grease, and other hydrocarbons to levels that protect downstream RO membranes from colloidal fouling. In addition, clarifiers do not settle well algae contained in the seawater because in most waters such algae are very small in size and are difficult to coagulate. Typically, the use of enhanced sedimentation technologies is needed for treating source water from open shallow intakes that are under the strong influence of high-velocity currents, river water, or wastewater discharges of elevated turbidity. This condition could occur when the desalination plant intake is located in a river delta area, ship channel, industrial port, or is influenced by a seasonal surface water runoff. For example, during the rainy season, the intake of the Point Lisas source water desalination plant in Trinidad is under the influence of the Orinoco River currents, which carry a large amount of alluvial solids. As a result, the desalination plant intake turbidity could exceed 200 NTU ( Conventional sedimentation tanks (clarifiers or settlers) are used for removal of suspended solids prior to filtration when the source water turbidity exceeds 20 NTU but is lower than 50 NTU. These clarifiers cannot produce water adequate for direct feed to the RO membranes and the clarified effluent will have to be filtered by granular media or membrane filtration prior to desalination. Since conservatively designed membrane filtration systems can handle up to the same level of source water turbidity (e.g., 50 Conventional sedimentation tanks could be configured as rectangular or circular structures. To date, rectangular sedimentation tanks have found most common application for pretreatment of saline source waters because of their lower costs and slightly superior performance. Key design criteria for this type of tanks are presented below: Lamella sedimentation tanks (clarifiers or settlers) usually have superior performance and three to four times smaller footprint as compared to conventional clarifiers and they can handle up to four times higher source water turbidity (e.g., up to 200 Lamella clarifiers can be configured both as rectangular or circular structures. However, rectangular lamella clarifiers have found the widest application for pretreatment of saline Lamella modules used in the high-rate settlers are proprietary products and design engineer should consult equipment manufacturers regarding lamella module configuration, number and size of modules as well as design surface loading rate and depth of the sedimentation tank. The example below illustrates general design criteria for a lamella settler for pretreatment of the source water for a 50,000 The plant filter backwash flow is 8.5% of the intake flow and lamella clarifier waste stream (sludge) flow is 0.6% of the intake plant flow. The pretreatment system is designed to operate with addition of coagulant, flocculant, and pH adjustment of the source water flow. The lamella settler system is designed to treat a total of 127,910 In However, if the surface loading rate is calculated by dividing the feed flow by the physical total surface area of the lamella settlers, this loading rate will be approximately five times higher in this example (7.7 Dissolved air flotation (DAF) technology is very suitable for removal of floating particulate foulants such as algae, oil, grease, or other contaminants that cannot be effectively removed by sedimentation or filtration. DAF systems can typically produce effluent turbidity of <0.5 DAF process uses very small size air bubbles to float light particles and organic substances (oil, grease) contained in the source water ( A typical DAF system consists of the following key components: coagulation and flocculation chambers; air saturation zone, flotation​ chamber, air saturation system, and clarified water recycling system (see As indicated in After coagulation and flocculation, the saline source water is mixed with clarified water, which is saturated with air to expose the particles in the saline source water in contact with the air bubbles that will carry them to the surface of the clarifier. The clarified water is recycled from the effluent end of the DAF units and is pumped through an air saturator at a rate of 10%–15% of the flow rate of the source water entering the DAF clarifier. Typically, 8–12 The flotation chamber is a rectangular tank designed for a surface loading rate of 20–35 The sludge layer (blanket) collected on the surface of the DAF tanks is removed by hydraulic means or by mechanical scrapers and directed for subsequent solids-handling system. Based on existing practices, the coagulation process is often enhanced by an acid feed that allows to adjust the pH of the source water to optimum level for formation of large, strong, and light flocs. Some of the solids contained in the source water may settle rather than float during the DAF clarification process. Such solids accumulate at the bottom of the DAF tanks over time and are periodically removed from there via bottom sediment collection and evacuation system. Under normal operational condition, the sludge blanket level has solids concentration of 1%–3% and is 0.5–1.0 Full-scale experience at SWRO desalination plants, to date, shows that DAF systems do not perform well if the source water turbidity is less than 5 Practical experience, to date, shows that the most common problems associated with DAF clarifier performance are caused by: Inadequate coagulation and flocculation of the suspended solid particles in the source water due to the low charge of these particles; Mismatch between the size of the source water particles and that of the DAF air bubbles; Low air bubble release pressure that does not provide adequate energy for the bubbles to overcome the drag forces of the dense saline water and results in bubble burst in mid-water column rather than carrying of the solids to the top of the DAF clarifiers; Short-circuiting caused by lack of baffling devices inside most proprietary DAF systems available on the market at present; Ineffective sludge removal—especially for DAF clarifiers where the sludge blanket is removed by hydraulic overflow rather than by mechanical sludge collection mechanism. Overdosing of coagulant and flocculant are often the two most common operational challenges of DAF systems when the source water turbidity is low (<5 The surface loading rate for removal of light particulates and floatable substances by DAF is several times higher than that needed for conventional sedimentation. Another benefit of DAF as compared to conventional sedimentation is the higher density of the formed residuals (sludge). While residuals collected at the bottom of sedimentation basins typically have concentration of only 0.3%–0.5% solids, DAF residuals (which are skimmed off the surface of the DAF tank) contain solids’ concentration of 1%–3%. In some full-scale applications, the DAF process is combined with granular media filters to provide a compact and robust pretreatment of source water with high algal and/or oil and grease content. Although this combined DAF/filter configuration is very compact and cost-competitive, it has three key disadvantages: complicates the design and operation of the pretreatment filters; DAF loading is controlled by the filter loading rate and, therefore, DAF tanks are typically oversized; and flocculation tanks must be coupled with individual filter cells. The feasibility of DAF application for pretreatment of saline surface waters is determined by the source water quality and is governed by turbidity concentration and overall lifecycle pretreatment costs. The DAF process can handle source water with turbidity of up to 50 Although DAF systems have much smaller footprint than conventional flocculation and sedimentation facilities, they include a number of additional equipment associated with air saturation and diffusion, and with recirculation of a portion of the treated flow, and therefore, their construction costs are typically comparable to these of conventional sedimentation basins and higher than lamella settlers of the same capacity. Usually, the O&M costs of DAF systems are higher than these of sedimentation tanks due to the higher power use for the flocculation chamber mixers, air saturators, recycling pumps, and sludge skimmers. The total power use for DAF systems is usually 0.05–0.075 DAF clarifiers for seawater applications have several key differences as compared to these for fresh surface waters: (1) they have to remove smaller size algal cells and, therefore, have to have diffusers that create smaller size bubbles; (2) seawater has significantly higher density than freshwater and therefore requires operation at higher air pressures to provide adequate solids removal; (3) seawater particles and algae have lower charge than freshwater solids, which makes them more difficult to coagulate and flocculate and requires larger contact chambers than there of freshwater DAF systems. The differences between seawater and freshwater applications of DAF are discussed in greater detail in the following publication ( Practical experience shows that DAF system design that is not adopted to the specific water quality challenges of seawater pretreatment often does not meet performance expectations of high algal content removal, especially during normal (non-algal bloom) source water conditions when the content of algae in the water is low (<500 Smaller ocean water algal particles require smaller size air bubbles for effective removal. The optimum range of the size of the air bubbles is directly related to the predominant size of algal cells in the source water, which can be determined by the completion of algal profiles of this water. Most existing commercially available DAF technologies have been created for wastewater and freshwater applications and, therefore, the majority of the bubbles generated by their diffuser systems are in a range of 30 and 100 Because of its higher density and viscosity than fresh water, seawater requires 20%–30% higher air saturation and introduction of the air at higher pressures. As a result, while the required pressure of the feed water recycled to the DAF for freshwater is 4–6 Low-charge particles in seawater as compared to high charge particles in fresh water require longer contact time and better mixing in the coagulation and flocculation chambers to form large-enough flocks for effective removal in the flotation zone of the DAF clarifiers. With freshwater particles and algae that carry strong negative charge, addition of coagulant (ferric chloride or sulfate) that carries positive charge will result in creation of large flocks in a very short time, based on strong opposite-charge attraction. With fine uncharged seawater particles, the main mechanism of flock formation is direct physical contact with the coagulant particles, which requires more time, especially if the solids concentration is very low (i.e., at low feed water turbidity). As a result, a typical 5–7-min contact time used to design the flocculation chambers of DAFs for freshwater applications will be insufficient for adequate size flock formation of seawater particles—a contact time of at least 10–15 min is needed for DAF systems processing seawater. One proprietary DAF system designed for seawater pretreatment applications addresses this challenge by installing a device referenced as “the Turbomix,” which increases particle collision and flocculation ( The key design criteria for the coagulation and flocculation chambers, flotation chamber, and recycle system of typical DAF clarifier are presented below: Since most existing proprietary DAF systems were developed for removal of freshwater algae that usually are an order of magnitude larger in size than seawater algae, the air bubble systems of existing DAFs are designed to generate bubbles of size that are significantly larger than optimum. This flaw could be addressed by modification of the air-bubble nozzle system to produce smaller size bubbles and fit the size of the smallest size of algae, which occur in the ambient saline source water during the algal bloom season. The most appropriate bubble size could be determined based on source water particle size and algal speciation analyses. Pressurizing the air-saturated clarified DAF stream to higher levels (8–10 Short-circuiting that occurs in some of the exiting proprietary DAF systems could be addressed by the installation of baffles within the DAF tanks, which break the flow pattern and increase the contact time between the air bubbles and source water particles. If the DAF system has an ineffective sludge removal system, which does not allow easy evacuation of particles collected on the tanks' bottom, such tanks would need to be taken out of service and cleaned periodically. Otherwise, the solids accumulated at the bottom of the DAF tanks will begin to digest anaerobically and disintegrate into finer much more difficult to filter particles, which in turn, will deteriorate the performance of the downstream filtration facilities. It is important to note that DAF clarifiers usually do not remove significant amount of alluvial organics and biopolymers, i.e., UV DAF process with built-in filtration (DAFF) is used at the 136,000 The source seawater has total suspended solids concentration that can reach up to 60 A combination of DAF followed by two-stage dual-media pressure filtration has been successfully used at the 45,400 The DAF system at this plant is combined in one facility with a coagulation and flocculation chamber. The average and maximum flow rising velocities of the DAF system are 22 and The downstream pressure filters are designed for surface loading rate of 25 Another example of large seawater desalination plant incorporating DAF system for pretreatment is the 200,000 The intake of the desalination plant is located 2200 This example DAF clarifier is designed for seawater desalination plant with production capacity of 50,000 The plant filter backwash flow is 5% of the intake flow, and lamella clarifier waste stream (sludge) flow is 0.5% of the intake plant flow. Maximum algal count in the source water is 60,000 The pretreatment system will need to be designed to treat a total of 127,910 The graph of As can be seen on Based on readings from
