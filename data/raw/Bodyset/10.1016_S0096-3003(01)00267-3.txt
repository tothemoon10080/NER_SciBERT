In this paper, a general analytical solution for calculating n-fold convolution power of exponential-sum distribution functions is developed by means of Laplace transform technique. In principle, the formulae presented in this paper provide complete solution for any number of exponentials and any folds of convolution power. Testing results show that those formulae are correct.In many problems of probability theory and stochastic process, one quite often has to calculate the In practice, distribution functions are usually measured by experiments, and then the measured discrete data are fitted to some function forms for further applications. It has been long known that experimental data can fit to some exponential sums under controlled error By definition, the Performing Laplace transform Our objective here is to find the solutions for Performing Laplace transform to Taking above result into Taking Let us test a simple case first. A one-exponential density distribution function can be expressed by: Now we shall test some more complicated cases. We may perform direct integration to calculate the In the research of mineral liberation from coal, the linear intercept length distribution of pure coal phase in a coal sample has been measured with scanning electron microscopy coupled with automatic image analysis technique, and the cumulative distribution function can be described by the following exponential sums The numerical results from both Maple integration and this solution are exactly the same. The calculated results for Maple can do good job with the calculation of The limited tests show that the general analytical solution for the This work was supported by US Department of Energy under grant number DE-FG22-95PC95220.   Let us modify Function By directly doing derivative, we can find that the sign of d Obviously, the sum of all terms with the complete combination of
