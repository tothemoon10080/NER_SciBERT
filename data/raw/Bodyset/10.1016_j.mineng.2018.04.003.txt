The study aims to investigate the interaction process of Cu(OH)2 molecule and sphalerite (1 1 0) surface using Ab initio molecule dynamic(AIMD) simulation. The results of AIMD indicate that the hydroxyl (OH−) in Cu(OH)2 tends to interact with the surface Zn atom, however, that of the Cu tends to interact with surface S atom. Due to the different motion path of OH− and Cu, the bond of Cu-OH in Cu(OH)2 is fractured, resulting in the release of Cu2+ from Cu(OH)2. The density of states analysis after AIMD simulation shows that the O 2p orbital interacts chemically with the Zn 3d orbital, while the Cu 3d orbital interacts with the S 3p orbital. It implies strongly that an adsorption activation exists between the Cu(OH)2 and the S atom of sphalerite surface.The mechanism of copper activation of sphalerite has been extensively studied over several decades. For acidic condition, it is generally accepted that the mechanism of copper activation sphalerite follows an ion exchange mechanism (  Firstly, Cu(OH) However, some other researchers ( According to Eq. All these studies provide valuable background on the mechanism of copper activation sphalerite at alkaline condition. However, the activation mechanism is controversial, particularly on the problem how the Cu The The AIMD simulation provides a powerful method to observe the motion trend of atoms in simulation system as a function of time and temperature, which can aid in the interpretation of the fundamental aspects of copper activation. As the most easily cleaved plane, the (1 1 0) surface of sphalerite was extensively investigated. The dynamic process of Cu(OH) As shown in It can be clearly seen from the The partial DOS (PDOS) of various interaction atoms in the simulation system were analyzed after 1 ps dynamic simulation, with the results illustrated in It can be seen from AIMD simulation results show the hydroxyl (OH Financial supports from the
