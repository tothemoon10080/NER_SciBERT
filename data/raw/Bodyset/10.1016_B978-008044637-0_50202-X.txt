Single-storey steel buildings are used for light industrial, commercial, and recreational purposes, and represent a vast proportion of the building stock in Canada. The seismic force resisting system (SFRS) of these structures typically includes a steel roof deck diaphragm that transfers horizontal loads to vertical steel bracing bents. The roof diaphragm is made of corrugated steel deck panels that are fastened to each other to support beams and joists. These diaphragms are relatively flexible, and in-plane roof deformations due to lateral loads must be accounted for in a design. In seismically active regions, structures designed according to modem building codes are expected to experience some degree of inelastic response under strong earthquakes. The chapter presents a study to examine the impact of capacity design provisions and period limitations prescribed in Canadian design codes and standard on the cost of low-rise steel buildings. The results show that capacity design provisions significantly influence the cost of the structure, especially when tension-compression bracing is used. Allowing inelastic response in the roof diaphragm can also contribute in reducing the cost of the structure.
