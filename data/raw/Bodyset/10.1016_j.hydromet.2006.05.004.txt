The extraction and separation of divalent zinc and manganese from a sulphate solution was carried out using sodium salts of D2EHPA, PC88A and Cyanex 272 in kerosene. Extraction of metal ions increased with increasing equilibrium pH of feed solution and extractant concentration. The separation factor of zinc over manganese was maximized according to equilibrium pH and extractant concentration. The separation factor of zinc over manganese was highest with 0.05 M NaPC88A, which was used in a separation study. Extraction of zinc from Zn–Mn solution and extraction of manganese from the Zn-free solution were carried out with 0.05 M NaPC88A in two stages at 1:1 phase ratio. The respective loaded organic phases were stripped with 0.03 M H2SO4 and 0.02 M H2SO4 in two stages at 1:1 phase ratio.Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA), 2-ethylhexyl phosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (PC88A) and bis-(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl) phosphinic acid (Cyanex 272) have been successfully used as extractants for various metal ions from sulphate solutions including zinc and manganese. The order of extraction of eight metal ions from a sulphate solution using D2EHPA has been reported ( Most practical studies of zinc extraction with D2EHPA have been carried out on liquors containing little manganese. Extraction of zinc from a sulphate solution containing 3.3 kg/m  In this piece of work, extraction of zinc and manganese from a sulphate solution has been carried out using 0.03, 0.05 and 0.06 M sodium salts of D2EHPA, PC88A and Cyanex 272 in kerosene, where 0.05 M PC88A was chosen for the separation study. Extraction of zinc could be carried out at a lower pH than manganese and the number of stages for extraction and stripping was determined. This was followed by stripping the zinc loaded organic with 0.03 M H Stock solutions of MnSO The commercial grade extractants D2EHPA, PC88A and Cyanex 272 were procured from Mobil, Daihachi Chemicals and Cytec Industries, respectively, and used as it is without further purification. The sodium form of the extractant was prepared (60% neutral) by adding the requisite volume of concentrated NaOH solution to the extractant in kerosene (165–190 °C fraction) and mixing the phases intimately to form a single phase. TBP (5% v/v) was added to the extractant solution in kerosene to act as a phase modifier. The metal-bearing solution was equilibrated with an equal volume of sodium salt of extractant for 5 min in a separating funnel and the pH of the aqueous phase was adjusted to the desired value. The separated aqueous phase was analysed with a Perkin Elmer Model 3100 Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer and the concentration of metal in the organic phase was determined by difference. When required, the organic phase analysis was determined after filtration through 1PS phase separating paper and stripping with 2 M HCl followed by analysis with AAS. All the extraction and stripping experiments were carried out at 30 Extraction of 0.01 M Zn(II) and Mn(II) from an aqueous solution of 0.1 M Na In case of extraction with NaD2EHPA, zinc extraction (31–99%) and manganese extraction (0.2–46%) increased with increasing equilibrium pH and increasing extractant concentration from 0.03 to 0.06 M. With 0.05 M NaD2EHPA, zinc extraction increased from 76% to 97% and manganese extraction increased from 4% to 41% with increasing equilibrium pH from 3.2 to 3.95. In case of extractions with NaPC88A, zinc extraction increased from 20% to 99.9% and manganese extraction increased from 2% to 42% with increasing extractant concentration from 0.03 to 0.06 M and with increasing equilibrium pH from 3.0 to 5.1. In case of extractions with Cyanex 272, zinc extraction increased from 7% to 99.9% and manganese extraction increased from 0.2% to 51% with increasing extractant concentration from 0.03 to 0.06 M and equilibrium pH from 3.2 to 5.95. The Separation Factor ( For 0.03 M reagents, the extraction of manganese was minimized and the affinity for zinc extraction was in the order: NaD2EHPA The aqueous solution containing 0.01 M Zn and Mn with 0.1 M Na This prediction was confirmed by carrying out a two-stage counter-current simulation study up to five cycles at equal phase ratio where the partially loaded organic from extraction stage 2 was fed to extraction stage 1. A study on stripping of zinc values (0.01 M) from the partially loaded 0.05 M PC88A was carried out at equal phase ratio with different concentrations of H The McCabe–Thiele plot ( To extract manganese values from the zinc-free raffinate (pH 4.8) using 0.05 M PC88A, the effect of pH on extraction of the metal ion was studied at the outset. Extraction studies were carried out from a synthetic solution containing 0.01 M Mn The pH of zinc-free solution was 4.8. From the above pH variation study it was observed that for an initial pH of 3.1 (equilibrium pH 6.2) the quantum of extraction was 99%. Therefore, the pH of zinc-free solution need not be altered for good manganese recovery. For this a McCabe–Thiele plot for extraction of manganese was constructed ( This theoretical prediction was confirmed by carrying out a two-stage counter-current simulation study with 0.05 M PC88A up to five cycles at Elution of manganese from the loaded organic phase was carried out by equilibrating 10 ml of loaded organic phase with 10 ml acid solution, ranging from 0.001 to 0.07 M H The McCabe–Thiele plot for stripping of Mn-loaded PC88A was constructed while keeping the total volume of phases constant and Solvent extraction and separation of 0.01 M divalent zinc and manganese from a sulphate solution has been carried out using sodium salts of D2EHPA, PC88A and Cyanex 272 in kerosene. Extraction isotherms of Zn(II) and Mn(II) with increasing equilibrium pH are reported with a deficiency and small excess of reagent. In case of NaD2EHPA, the separation factor for Zn(II) and Mn(II) decreased with increasing extractant concentration from 0.03 to 0.06 M. The separation factor of zinc over manganese with NaPC88A was optimum at 0.05 M. Although it is possible to separate the metal ions from the sulphate solution using all the extractants, the separation factor with 0.05 M NaPC88A was the highest. The extraction of zinc from the Zn–Mn solution was demonstrated with 0.05 M NaPC88A in two stages at 1:1 phase ratio followed by the stripping of zinc loaded organic with 0.03 M H One of the authors, K.C.
