Water molecules can be easily adsorbed on the surface or in the interlayer space of clay minerals. This process is named hydration which plays an important role in various application fields. In order to find how water interacted with surface through minimizing the interaction among multiple waters, the adsorptions of single water molecule on external surfaces of sodium-montmorillonite (Na-MMT), including (001) basal and (010) edge surface, were theoretically investigated based on periodic density functional theory (DFT) method. The adsorption energies and geometries as well as electronic properties were studied in the work. It was found that water molecule was adsorbed on Na-MMT (001) basal surface mainly through electrostatic interaction between water molecule and Na+ cation, and was adsorbed on (010) edge surface through hydrogen bonding between water and surface OH or OH2 groups. The adsorption energy Eads value of water molecule on (010) edge surface was larger than that on (001) basal surface. After adsorption, a part of electron density was transferred from both Na-MMT (001) and (010) surfaces to water molecule. Based on the PDOS, there was the bonding between Na 3s and Ow 2p orbitals on (001) basal surface and between H 1s and O 2p orbitals for hydrogen bonds on (010) edge surface.Clay minerals are mainly composed of illite, kaolinite and montmorillonite, which usually exist at less than 2 As a kind of high swelling clay mineral, montmorillonite can easily exfoliate to smaller particles and then increase the hydration degree and viscosity, leading to the higher stability of suspension than other clay minerals, so montmorillonite has more detrimental effect on the sedimentation, flotation, and filtration of coal slime water In the literatures by quantum chemical calculations about hydration of montmorillonite, some researches generally used oversimplified cluster models for the clay surfaces Because there was no available experimental atomic coordinate, the initial model of montmorillonite derived from pyrophyllite structure through the replacement of Al Density functional theory (DFT) based on the Kohnâ€“Sham formula In the paper, we would use the following notations: H According the surface symmetry, four top, six bridge, and three hollow adsorption sites of the single water molecules on Na-MMT (001) basal surface were examined, as shown in In M(001)W-1, the plane of adsorbed water was perpendicular to the (001) basal surface. The water was adsorbed through the O Since there were some previous studies showing the corrugation of MMT after adsorption of water or other molecules The (010) edge surface of Na-MMT exhibited more complex adsorption sites and stronger activity than (001) surface due to the presence of many Al The mechanism of water molecule adsorption on Na-MMT surface could be clarified by the electron transfer analysis among the adjacent atoms in the H The electron density difference of the most stable structure M(001)W-1 and M (010)W-1 were plotted in Mulliken atomic charges Additionally, Mulliken atomic charges in the most stable structures M(001)W-1 and M(010)W-1 could be reflected though the calculated electrostatic potentials along the z-direction, which were plotted in It was useful to clarify the interaction mechanism between adsorbed water molecule and the Na-MMT surface by calculating the partial density of states (PDOS). For the adsorption of water on Na-MMT (001) surface, the PDOS of the interaction between Na For the adsorption of water on Na-MMT (010) surface, the PDOS of two hydrogen bonds between water and the surface in M(010)W-1 were plotted in The adsorptions of single water molecule on (001) basal and (010) edge surface of Na-MMT were studied using periodic DFT method. The results can be concluded as following: (1) Water molecule was adsorbed on Na-MMT (001) basal surface mainly through the electrostatic interaction between water and Na The financial supports for this work from the
