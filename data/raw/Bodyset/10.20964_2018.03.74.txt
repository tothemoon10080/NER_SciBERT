In this paper, molten NaCl-KCl-MnCl2 mixture salts were used as electrolyte, tungsten as the cathode and graphite as the anode to explore the influence of different current density, electrolysis temperature and electrolysis time on current efficiency and microstructure of manganese deposits. The morphology of products were examined by scanning electron microscopy. The results demonstrated that the current efficiency and morphology of deposited manganese varied with electrodeposition time, operating temperature and current density. The optimized conditions for the highest current efficiency (98%) were obtained at the temperature of 710°C, with the electrodeposition time for 7h and the operating current density of 300 mA • cm-2, respectively.
