                        Many authors have conducted the study on African resources-rich countries mining regulatory and legal framework with objective of creating more opportunities of foreign investments, but the external origin of the reform process responsible for the new regulatory frameworks over the last 20 years has had other far-reaching implications of governance to rich the goal. This has been demonstrated in numerous articles such as Campbell (2002) (Regulating Mining in Africa: for Whose Benefit? corporate strategies and government policies in the international diamond industries), Otto (2002) (Investing for sustainability: the management of mineral wealth) and Sakala (2012) (Africa: Experts to Review Africa's Tax Incentives) and so on.
                      In line with this aforementioned Guinea adopted a new mining code in September 2011 which replaced the mining code of 1995. This study sheds light on some of the central issues in the continuing process of mining legislation revision, the short term optimization of mining taxes and incentives attractiveness so as to illustrate their effects on both government revenues and returns on investment. Through a quantitative comparison of the tax rates in the context of developed and developing resources-rich countries, it can be concluded that the past regulatory frameworks are uncompetitive in terms of foreign investments' attraction. The new regulation code itself has some negative impacts on the previous investments, as well as bringing down living standards in areas of critical importance for socio-economic development.

                        The adoption of new mining code coincided with the economic crisis of some operating companies in Guinea such as BHP Billiton, Rusal Alumina and Rio Tinto who were ready to slow some of their worldwide investments with mineral exploration projects. One of the immediate consequences was, some of those companies stopped operations by fearing that falling mineral commodity and government intervention could precipitate massive investment losses. This generated the decrease of numerous relative economic activities including direct and indirect jobs (see Revenue Watch Institute (2013).The fears for supplying raw minerals in industrialized countries have disappeared since the mid-1980s. Thus, the majority of mining operations controlled by nations have been privatized during the 1990s; consequentially over 100 countries including Guinea (in 1995) have established mining legislation or revised their mining codes to attract new investments and improve their economy ( Since from 1990s, African resource-rich countries have shown numerous changes by reviewing existing mining conventions and conducting tax audit with external assistances in order to ensure the proper practice of mining business ( increasing state stakeholder depending on minerals types from overall mining projects (15–35%); changing the rates of surface and fixed fees; changing mineral royalty rates (mining taxes); replacing tax base, the Free On Board (F.O.B) value to London Metal Exchange (LME); changing the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) assessment system or B.I.C (Impôt sur les Bénéfices Industrielles et Commerciales) including the exemption of Value Added Tax (VAT), the custom duties on import-export, and others incentives; modifying tax regime stabilization, capital gain taxation and the provision for replenishing deposits; implementing the articles and toughening the procedures for acquiring mining permits. This article looks at an overview of Guinean new mining tax policy perception as a result of the lack of capacity to levy the natural resource industry by: (1) evaluating the short term tax burden on companies currently operating in Guinea which sheds light on some of the central issues in the continuing process of revision and providing optimal design of mining legislation; (2) the quantitative comparison of fiscal regimes in the context of developed and developing resource-rich countries for the understanding the effects/impacts of the current fiscal regime on the strategic development of mining industry; and (3) analysis of tax competitiveness for providing the balance between tax administrators, foreign direct investors and local community. This is the first attempt of such study to understand the effects/impacts of the current mining fiscal regime on the industry, finding the references and data were extremely difficult to fully accomplish all the requirements of the journal. The analysis are based on data from MMGG (Ministere des Mines et de la Geologie de Guinee), Guinean mining codes 1995 and 2011, as well as the mining codes of some African resources-rich countries, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East between 2010 and 2012. The additional information was collected from related articles, distinguished websites through some publications e.g. IMF, WB, PwC, Norton rose, Detoilette, etc. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2: Mining fiscal regime Section 3: Different types of taxes in Guinea Section 4: Comparison of mining tax rates Section 5: Mining tax incentives & exemptions. Finally, a Conclusion assorted by different recommendations will come to close this work. The fiscal regime ranks as one of the most important factors in the successful contribution of mining projects to the country's economic development (   These regimes generally generate revenue for mineral owner e.g. government as soon as extraction commences ( Furthermore, the Mineral Resource Rent Tax (RRT) is applied in some experienced countries that includes income tax (may be set higher than the general corporate income tax rate) and the resource rent tax (imposed only on positive accumulated cash flow). The proper information is available in Australian Mineral Resource Rent Tax effective ( The Guinea retains resources ownership while contracting mineral exploration and mining development to private companies and the arrangement of profit-sharing depends on distinguished minerals and the categories of projects. The Graphs No. 1 shows the comparison of production sharing schemes under mining code 1995 and 2011. The assessment process may be complicated due the uncertainty of profitability and the complexity of allowable recoverable costs evaluation. The disadvantages for lower economic countries such as Guinea are the financial progress and underpinning projects agreement before it move ahead ( Based on the current tax regime, Guinean mining code lists four different mining titles through which the tax administrative imposes on firms some levies such as fixed and variable surface fees, royalties, income tax and so on (  The regulations (as per acts 137 and 138 of old mining code 1995 and acts 159 and160 of the new mining code 2011) state that “mining licensure subscriptions with prospecting, operating, and mining concessions permits for minerals or quarry substances are subject to an annual payment of surface tax; the rates are fixed by the joint order of Minister of Finance and Economic, and the Minister of Mines and Geology”. The comparative study results show that, the fixed fees and superficial royalties rose in proportion to the types of permits. For example, the delivery fees for existing mining titles increase in proportion to the types of permits as follows: 1000GNF ($0. 142) to $10 for exploration permit, i.e. an increase of 99%; 15,000GNF ($2.1243) to $75 for exploitation/operating permits, an increase of 97%; 200,000GNF ($28.3246) to $150 for mining concession titles, an increase of 81%. Additionally, the payment processes are complicated for foreign firms by dealing with two different ministries cited above. The holders of exploration licenses (especially for small scale businesses) may also face some economic troubles with the continual acquisitions of these fees. So, increasing the rates/amount would create surcharges on mineral exploration and mining development expenditures. One of the ultimate consequences is that, most of the Guinean important mining projects take several years before commencing production; this is due to the non-improvement of infrastructures and inadequate energy for better running of mining operations. This therefore needs a proper review of surface tax rates and currency base.  Gross value was used to calculate royalty rates on industrial/energy minerals, and gemstones. The designing is based on the Gross of the minerals produced. For the purposes of computing mineral royalty, gross value was considered as “the realizable price for sale (F.O.B.) at the fiscal office”. Norm Value is currently used to estimate royalty rates on precious and base-metals. The calculation is based on the following mechanisms: The monthly average of LME cash price per metric ton multiplied by the quantity of the metal or recoverable metal sold. The monthly average of metal bulletin cash price per metric ton multiplied by the quantity of the metal or recoverable metal sold to the extent that the metal price is not quoted on LME. The monthly average of any other exchange market approved by the Commissioner General Cash price per metric ton multiplied by the quantity of the metal or recoverable metal sold to the extent that the metal price is not quoted on the LME or Metal Bulletin. As shown in In 2000, Pr. James M. Otto enumerated in his “Mining Taxation in Developing Countries” that Governments have many choices in selecting the types of taxes and incentives in their fiscal system (   Based on their complicity and effects on tax assessment system, the production based taxes are more practicable in providing the early taxes payment for governments to finance the public sector with recurrent expenditures. On the other hand, they are more simply earmarked for political purposes and their downside is that they are regressive, can raise financial risks for companies and require tax payments when a mining project suffers investment losses ( The state participation under the new 2011 mining code makes the fiscal regime standardized and should allow the state to generate substantial revenues from its mining projects (Poupak Bahamin, 2012). The comparison of Guinean mining code 1995 and 2011 is presented in graph no. 2. The State is entitled to an overall shareholding of 35% as corporate income tax from the project in the share capital of mining companies; this participation fluctuates according to the mineral substances involved and is fixed as follows: A free and non-dilutive shareholding from 2.5% to 15% as Free Carried Interest (FCI) for state in any developed mining project ( An option to purchase an additional shareholding from 20% to 32.5% as the contributing interest at a price to be agreed with the investor ( Under the previous mining code, the State was entitled to 15 percent of the contributing interest for bauxite, gold/ silver/ platinum and diamond projects; due to the non-advancement of mineral reconnaissance, exploration and exploitation projects of such minerals, the old mining code did not provide the shareholding for integrated project mineral. Mining concessions were granted for 25-year periods with 10-year extensions. Guinea had an attractive mining tax regime but not globally competitive with world standards ( The new mining code comes with some differentiations in which, the state is getting free equity according to the different categories of mining projects and the types of mineral resources. For example 5% of FCI and 25% of share in Bauxite–Alumina integrated projects; 15% of FCI and 20% of share in Iron ore, Bauxite, Gold, Diamond and radioactive mineral projects (see new mining code act 150). For metals and others substances, the proportion of FCI decreases depending on the increasing of share such as: Alumina (7.5%+22.5%) and Aluminum or steel (2.5%+27.5%). The agreements with shareholders belong to the decisions of State government that has an objective of taking always 35% as overall participation in mining projects; this contributing interest can be reduced either by exchanging with some particular supports, or by increasing mining tax rates. The old mining code per act No. 143.2 provided an additional profit tax to equilibrate the benefits on mining windfall revenues. During its calculation, they consider that the non-reinvested amount after deduction of B.I.C taxes at the rate 35% should be taxed at 50%. The new mining code 2011 act No. 177 specifies the evidences regarding Guinea income tax considered as tax on Industrial & Commercial Benefits (B.I.C); its states that “the holders of operating titles for mineral substances or legal person who own quarry operating licenses are supposed to pay tax on B.I.C at the rate of 35%”. This tax is based on the context of taxable net benefits determined with the accounting principles. The following fees may be deductibles during its calculation: operating expenses/fees, salaries and all costs attributable to employers, financing costs, deferred losses, depreciation, investment credit (up to 5% of the amount invested during fiscal year and others of mine sites' restoration), rents, duties fees, and so on. The B.I.C also may be payable immediately in accordance with prevailing regulations of mining convention for the holder of operating or concessions tittles. Based on perceptions of new mining code (2011) through act Nos. 13 and 175, foreign taxes on BIC in Guinea some times are not deductibles unless the framework by convention provides the double taxation system; this may have minor burden for firms, but in reverse they get compensations by considering B.I.C as direct tax. The advantages of this businesslike for companies are numerous exemptions of B.I.C giving to the fiscal years and repartition of different zones (areas) below. Zone 1 (during the first 3 fiscal years); Zone 2 (during the first 5 fiscal years); Zone 3 (during the first 6 fiscal years). In addition, these exemptions request various approval documents during the tax assessment period. The Guinean withholding taxes (WHT) on payments for foreign services, on remitted dividends, and on loan interest paid to foreign banks are supposed to be assessed at the national level. The withholding tax rates of selected resources-rich countries are presented in The national governments normally use import–export duties to achieve a broad range of fiscal policy and objectives, e.g. Zambia, Ghana, South Africa. Like a “consumer” tax, export duty on minerals must be competed globally; almost all mineral-exporting nations have chosen to negate the impact of tax on export mineral sales. Based on differences of policies in respected countries, African Union has an ultimate objective of creating a single market through numerous exemptions with Import–Export duties; making import/export policy uniform at the national level could be more attractive to mining investments than dealing with multiple localized systems or provincial duties because such duties are usually collected at the major ports of entry where customs offices are established. Through this practice, it is probably not feasible for most provincial or local governments to establish the bureaucracy for maintaining a separate customs regulation ( The VAT like import duties is typically a national tax matters; the optimal assessment of such taxes should not be referred to others economic activities (Otto, 1995). The Guinean mining industry VAT is applied to purchase interests on both, goods and services. Between 1996 and 2004, the value added tax on all taxable items is assessed at the uniform rate of 18% (duty code 2004 per act Nos. 367 and 373). The returns on investments and heavy burden of businesses or capital-intensive of mining projects are generally submitted every two months within the annual turnover (Guinea and FMI, 2012). The VAT coverage was extended to the mining sectors including exemptions during mineral exploration and mining development phases. Based on a statement of new mining code per act No. 173, some transactions of VAT are zero-rate or exempted. The new mining code, unlike the previous, has introduced new tax rates and duties regime applicable to all projects. However, the new mining code does not provide the guarantees of tax stability period and customs regimes to the holders of exploitation permits. Under the existing mining convention, tax stabilization period does not exceed ten year period; with an exception for mining concessions, the holders may benefit from the additional stability for five years period by paying an annual premium which is supposed to be defined through some agreements; during this period of stability, the holders of mining concession titles are guaranteed by the lower rates of fixed fees, mining taxes and royalties. As mentioned by Otto mining industry is a captive capital, if mines are long-lived; companies will be reassured with a system that can reduce their fiscal vulnerability, particularly during the loan and project payback periods (Otto2000). This implies that governments are more vulnerable to changes in national tax policy than other forms of investment that are portable and suitable to the relocation of friendlier tax jurisdiction. The judicial system, which has been historically underfunded, inefficient and overtly corrupts, has consistently ruled in favor of government expropriation. The tax officials, notably the Minister of Mines, wield enormous influence in legal matters and policymaking (see mining code 2011 act 201, 203 and 212). In last decade, foreign investors have responded positively by improving Guinean political and economic climate, particularly in the mining sector, electricity and construction. However, the permanence of Guinean democracy remains making business difficult and complex ( In a study undertaken on the Ministry of Mines and Geology in 2005, James M. Otto conducted an analysis of Guinean tax regime and compared it with other mining states. The study involved the evaluation of tax effective rate with the objective of evaluating the effects of applied taxes in mining industry by considering the approaches of using market as a proxy to determine “fairness” of tax regime and governance system in typical “model agreement” between tax authority and firms ( The results of his study concluded that the mining Code 1995 was well designed but complex and not “globally competitive”. In 2012, Becky M & Al from PwC group also conducted a very important research on the summary of regulatory frameworks and tax rates in selected countries ( tax regime system in current mining codes and regulations; fiscal accountability system in collecting bills or technical level of tax designers/officers; quality of state institution, governance and level of transparency (corruption); nature of existing contracts negotiated between states and companies; nature of states' political system in place; distribution of mineral potentials (reserves/grades); situation of mining infrastructures; and operating costs based characteristics of mining sites e.g. easy extraction of mineral ore for some mines. Our comparison study concerns the Guinean and worldwide resources-rich countries mining tax rates such as WHT, Import–Export duty, VAT and CIT (graph No. 3, references from Based on the criteria cited above, the resources-rich countries are classed into two main groups. The developed/experienced countries are getting more benefits from their mineral tax assessment. They may have lower tax rate of CIT but in reverse, this requests the higher rate of withholding tax or VAT for increasing the average rate of the profit based tax. The lowest rate of CIT in this comparative but more complicated to assess, the overall rate is 16%. For example, British Columbia earns 14.36% on net resource income; the 2% of royalty on net proceeds can be deducted; in Northwest Territories, the federal tax is 22.12% which includes 28% of statutory rate, 4% of surtax, and 7% of resource rent reduction. Provincial royalty and mining taxes are not deductibles from federal taxes; but there is 12.75% on net resource income in Saskatchewan, the resource allowance and royalties are deductibles ( The CIT is considerate as federal tax and not separate to state income tax (30% rate) including Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and Northern Territory ( The normal CIT rate in South Africa is 28% and its calculation appears complicated for Gold mining companies who are suggested to pay variable income tax according to the formula below (Julius Sakala, 2012).   Additionally, mining firms are also liable to pay customs and excise levy for development skills and VAT at the rate of 14%. In last April 2012, the STC has been replaced to withholding Tax on Dividends (DT). The new DT should be effective and levied at a rate varying between 10% and 15% applied to non-residents who are subject to pay DT discrimination; the resident companies are exempt ( The largest source of Russian government revenues in 2010 was trade taxes such as import and export taxes with a share of 20.8% in total government revenues. The added taxes (16.1%), social security contributions (16%), personal income taxes (11.6%), corporate income taxes (11.5%), and mineral resource extraction tax at 9.8% rate ( The Chinese mining tax rates have been generally increased for taxable minerals on last Feb 2012. The reform regarding fiscal policy was introduced in November 2011 with objective of implementing the new Resources Tax Law. Raising mining taxes on iron, tin and other minerals aimed for regulating the industry framework by hiking costs for small producers of ore ( The Brazilian government has not changed direct CIT rate for several years. Instead, it has altered deductions of indirect tax rates. The effective tax rate on corporate income is 34% (slightly less for smaller companies). This figure comprises two taxes: (1) the CIT as IRPJ (Imposto de Renda da Pessoa Juridical) base rate of 15%, plus a 10% of surcharge on monthly income that exceeds BRL 240,000 a year; (2) the social contribution on net profit or CSLL (Contribuição Social sobre o Lucro Liquid), which is generally levied at a 9% rate. The higher CSLL rate may apply depending on the business sectors. For example, financial institutions have to pay a 15% rate ( The tax authorities impose CIT as BIC explained above (at the rate of 35%); withholding taxes at the rate of 10% on foreign services payments, remitted dividends, and loan interest to foreign banks ( 0% on equipment during exploration and mining development phases to encourage new investments; 8% on mining equipment and accessories during exploitation phase for companies that opt to export mineral ore; and 6% on mineral processing equipment to promote tertiary sector. The Ghanaian owns 10% of free carried interest in all mining companies. Based on 2012 Budget Statement, government proposed an increase of CIT rate from 25% to 35% ( The CIT rate is fixed at 35% variable according to the following formula: The introduction of a new mining code came into force repealing the Mining Act 1998 [48a and 48b]. The new Act changed (i) the base on which royalties are charged and (ii) royalty rates. In terms of tax base, this is now “gross value”, which replaced the “net back value”, applied under the predecessor legislation ( Another exceptional discrimination in tax assessment is India where resident companies pay CIT at 32.445% rate and the taxable fees on income exceed INR 10 million plus 5% of surcharge on basic rate, and 2% or 1% of Education Cess on total tax (i.e. tax computed using basic rate including surcharge). The foreign companies pay CIT at 42.024% rate (taxable fees on income exceed INR 10 million). There is also surtax rated at 10% and surcharge ( As mentioned by Campbell, changing mining tax rates/tax base normally affects the promotion of new investments and disturbs financial system. Based on the short term risks of economic management, the earlier effects of tax reform in many developing countries go toward to both tax administrators and companies. One reward of tax reform is the complexity of new mechanism in mining industry revenue assessment. This is due to existing of numerous losses or returns on investment of some ongoing projects. On the other hand, tax reform affects local communities or disturbs mining activities indirectly by increasing unemployment rate. In world class producing countries, it may affect domestic or international supply of minerals ( The results of our quantitative comparative study show that selected resources-rich countries differ by the level of their economic growth, the nature of mineral potential endowment, efficiency of tax administrators, corruption level and terms of new regulations. The selected African resources-rich countries are short-changed in tax assessment and dealing with foreign investors; several indirect evidences regarding this presumption have been enumerated by Campbell and Ousmane Cagigo. As compared to the developed and experienced countries in tax assessment, African countries have not performed well with regard to revenue mobilization and investment climate due to the following reasons below. The first possible reason found here is the lack of capacity to optimize revenue generation from natural resources. The mining sector management procedures are quite complex which require adequate skills and experiences that government technocrats often do not possess. Furthermore, these procedures involve a better ability in designing tax regime and contract negotiations that could maximize government revenue without discouraging private investments. One policy implication from this finding is using profits from natural resources, investing in human capital development for the acquisition of specific skills to develop mineral industry. Hence, this would allow African countries to take more advantages in tax assessment issues. E.g. the revenue from resource booms could be used over time to support human capital for the future improvement of resource industry. The second possible reason of underperformance among African resourceful countries is their failure of taking advantages in allocating funds to develop related socio-economic infrastructures which include higher permanent voltage electricity, railways and mineral chipping ports ( The third reason comes to reinforce the first policy by implementing a policy that could encourage more domestic companies to participate in mining activities (mineral exploration, development and production). In case of Guinea, the higher grade of ore deposit and lower operating cost are some of the advantages for domestic companies to take full action and run bankable mining projects; the generated revenues could support government expenditures independently, managing several micro-economic activities to achieve high growth rates. This may avoid some interactions with foreign investors. Meanwhile, about 60% of the country's revenue comes from mining industry without state or indigenous domestic companies active into full production of mineral, the entire burden from tax reform affects only foreign firms; the local community or government depend mainly on foreign investment and foreign assistance through external grants or debts ( Mining activities implicate several taxes in diversified forms and the levy systems vary widely in the world. Each country has a gamut of levies with plethora of components impinging mining industry at various stages of mineral exploration, production, trade and final consumption. Thus, careful attention should be paid when designing mining tax parameters (tax regime, tax types, tax rates and tax base). The objectives of fiscal regime reform are usually revenue generation from extractive industry, employment creation, minimizing community disruption, development of related economic activities and addressing environmental consequences. However, once a country adopts the production sharing scheme system, there are limited rates at which resources can be taxed rationally; some administrations may precede a guarantee to payout investment losses and also allow a higher share in the event of success; in reverse, several obstacles of full taxation system in some developing countries may arise, the host governments (as principal) generally need to forego some charges in order to provide appropriate incentives for the better informed producers or their agents (Conrad Mulherin, 2012). Based on the findings of investigative analysis regarding the impacts of tax reform in quoted mining industry, the simple administrative system for tax authorities and the compliance for taxpayers are ubiquitous concerns in all areas of designing mining tax. By exploring certain aspects of past reforms impact in a set of mineral-rich African countries, this article attempts to contribute to the better understanding of the continuing debates and policy reform proposals in the context of revising Guinean mining tax regime. Although the amendments of new mining code are based on IMF recommendations, the following suggestions may come to reinforce the reform: making the currency uniform in the mining code to simplify the financial terms. e.g. some fees are estimated in GNF and others in USD (see act 161 from 2011 mining code); keeping the LME as tax base instead of F.O.B or using a specific formula related to mineral commodity prices during the calculation of fees. decreasing the fixed fees and surface fees to minimize the cost and risks of mineral exploration projects; reducing royalty rate for certain minerals; implementing tax exemptions system and reducing the rates of customs duties; reviewing some incentives system that would support the mining operation, capital gain tax, provision of ore deposit replenishment and restricted capitalization; explicating tax regime stabilization term to guarantee the investments, as well as reviewing standard of new mining conventions to be more consistent with the provisions. This paper has been the product of several years of ongoing data collection and analysis. The Guinean government through the ministry of mines and geologic, the Mineral Policy Institute are to be acknowledged for their in-kind support. As well as numerous international organizations such as WB, CPW for providing data and publishing responding to requests. Various teachers and colleagues also deserve sincere thanks for their help in reviewing earlier versions of this research work. See
