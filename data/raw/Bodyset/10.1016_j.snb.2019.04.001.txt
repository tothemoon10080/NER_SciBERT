Carbon-based nanocomposites that can operate at room temperature (25 °C) are potential sensing materials for application in chemical sensors owing to their unique physical properties such as extremely large surface-to-volume ratios and very high carrier mobility. However, most studies on sensing materials consisting of carbon-based nanocomposites have focused on synthesizing various material systems that contain metals, oxides, and chalcogenides, which are of limited use in practical gas sensors owing to their low response, poor selectivity, and irreversibility. Therefore, a simple approach to synthesizing carbon-based nanocomposites with high response and good gas selectivity utilizing microwave (MW) irradiation is proposed, and the sensing mechanisms underlying the enhanced sensing performance are discussed in detail. First, the perforation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) during MW irradiation is investigated systematically, and then nanocomposite gas sensors based on the opened SWCNTs with large surface areas and without additional functionalization are fabricated. The nanocomposite sensors exhibit an extremely high response (>6 at 10 ppm) and selectivity for ethanol (C2H5OH) at room temperature. In addition, the C2H5OH response of the holey SWCNT-Sn/SnO2 nanocomposites is much higher than those of carbon-based nanocomposites. These results show that the simple synthesis method utilizing MW irradiation would be useful for various material systems requiring surface engineering or functionalization.Semiconducting carbon-based nanomaterials (SCNMs) including single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), multi-walled CNTs, graphene (GR), graphene oxide (GO), and reduced GO (rGO) have been intensively explored as potential gas sensing materials owing to their remarkable advantages such as large surface areas, high conductivity, and ability to operate at room temperature [ Accordingly, to overcome these drawbacks, a variety of approaches, including not only hybridization [ In another approach that can enhance the sensing performance of SCNM-based sensors, defects such as oxygen functional groups and holes have been formed deliberately on the surface of SCNMs to act as adsorption sites for interaction with target gas molecules. Jang et al. studied the effect of oxygen functional groups in GO on the NO The above researches suggest that holey SWCNT-Sn/SnO In this study, we synthesize holey SWCNT-Sn/SnO A commercial semiconducting SWCNT mat (purity: >99%, NanoIntegris) and SnO The microstructures of the synthesized products were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Nova-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL TEM 2100 F) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The phases and chemical states of the SWCNT-Sn/SnO For the gas sensing measurement, patterned interdigitated electrodes consisting of Au (150 nm thick) and Ti (50 nm thick) layers were deposited on SiO  To further investigate the microstructure of the samples, TEM analysis was performed. The TEM images in From the XRD result in Furthermore, to confirm the generation of defects (or open holes) by Joule heating during MW irradiation, we also performed Raman spectroscopy [ All the sensing measurements in this study were tested at room temperature (25 °C) because of both realization of actual application in gas sensors and the preliminary experimental results. In fact, pristine SWCNT-based gas sensors fabricated by same process exhibited the best NO In addition, to further assess the C To explain the sensing mechanisms underlying the enhanced C Thus, at room temperature, the C The above equations indicate that the abundant defects (or open holes) and large specific surface area of the SWCNTs can significantly enhance the sensing performance by providing active sites for gas adsorption. In addition, the open structure can allow gas molecules smaller than the defects to easily approach the inner nanospace of the SWCNTs. As shown in According to the literatures [ The gas selectivity and humidity resistance are also critical factors for realizing practical gas sensors. Accordingly, we systematically investigated the gas selectivity of the SWCNT-S nanocomposite for various gas species, including 20 ppm CO, BTX gases, and 10 ppm SO The metal oxide catalysts with acidic and basic properties produce the different intermediate forms of C We successfully implemented C This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Supplementary material related to this article can be found, in the online version, at doi: The following is Supplementary data to this article:
