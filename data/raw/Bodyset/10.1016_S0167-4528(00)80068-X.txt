Molybdenite often appears in porphyry copper ores. The separation of copper and molybdenum values implies depression of either one of them. Depression of molybdenite involves dextrin and starches, which at the present time have little practical application. On the other hand, depression of copper and iron sulphides is a far more commonly used technique and is almost universally accepted.
                  In Yugoslavia molybdenite is found in two types of porphyry deposits: in Machkatica deposit in which molybdenite is a predominant useful mineral and in Majdanpek and Veliki Krivelj deposits in which copper minerals are predominant values and molybdenite may be recovered as a by-product.
                  Both copper deposits are unevenly mineralized with molybdenite. Content of molybdenum in the copper ore is between 0.001% and 0.005%. It is assumed that the average content is 0.003% what is much lower then in the main world copper mines which also produce molybdenite concentrates as by-products. To increase the molybdenite flotation recovery in copper concentrates, the collector diesel oil was added. This brought to slight increase of molybdenite recovery. Later on, by studying the Syntex-L influence on the diesel oil dispersion and on reduction of the negative electrokinetic potential on molybdenite surfaces, it was established the role of Syntex-L on the molybdenite recovery increase in the flotation cycle of copper flotation. The achieved Mo recovery was more than 80% with about 50% of Mo in the concentrate.
                  The objective of this paper is to present both the basic and applied researches with the aim to extract selective molybdenum concentrate. Attention has been given to the researches carried out in Yugoslavia, particularly to the molybdenite concentrate production from Majdanpek copper ore.
