The problem of Lagrange interpolation of functions of two variables by quadratic polynomials based on nodes which are vertices of a triangulation has been recently studied and local six-tuples of vertices which assure the uniqueness and the optimal-order of the interpolation polynomial are known. Following the idea of Little and the theoretical results on the approximation order and accuracy of the triangular Shepard method, we introduce an hexagonal Shepard operator with quadratic precision and cubic approximation order for the classical problem of scattered data approximation without least square fit.Variations of the Shepard method based on linear, quadratic and cubic polynomials, namely the Another variant of the Shepard method, which has linear precision and allows to reach quadratic approximation order without using any least square fit, has been introduced by Little With the aim of increasing the approximation order of the triangular Shepard method in presence of first order derivative data, in In order to avoid the use of any derivative nor solution of linear least square system to approximate them, in this paper we introduce the hexagonal Shepard operator as an extension of the Shepard and triangular Shepard operators to the case of six points. In particular, we use multinode basis functions Let be We introduce the six-point basis functions with respect to the set    Let  In Basis functions The bivariate Lagrange interpolation problem on six-points, when they are in general position (or poised, by following In 2008 Dalik Given a six-tuple By definition   Let us consider the second order Taylor expansion of Straightforward generalizations of the Little's idea using sets of For The problem of the detection of the local six-tuples of points which ensure the existence of the operator    The proof follows by In this section we concern the problem of the detection of the local six-tuples of points which ensure the existence of the operator In his paper of 2008 (see Section In line with To test the effectiveness of the algorithm for the detection of the six-tuple In the first experiment we consider the set constituted by the point In the second experiment we have considered a set In the third experiment we determine the cover of Starting from the idea of Little and being motivated by the theoretical results on the approximation order and accuracy of the triangular Shepard method, we have introduced an hexagonal Shepard operator with quadratic precision and cubic approximation order for the classical problem of scattered data approximation without least square fit. The numerical results show that this approach allows to improve the accuracy of approximation of the triangular Shepard method. Possibilities of improvements can be investigated in the following directions: extension to the trivariate case; enhancement of the approximation order in presence of additional derivative data; simultaneous interpolation of functional and derivative data; generalization to the case of 10 nodes.
