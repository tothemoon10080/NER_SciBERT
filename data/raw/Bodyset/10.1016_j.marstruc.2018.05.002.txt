Composite steel-concrete construction utilising the benefits of both materials has extensively been used in structural engineering with the ability to be used in onshore and offshore applications. One of these elements is the concrete-filled double-skin tubes (CFDST) which is a concept that has been developed in recent years. In this column, the steel tubes can support considerable amounts of loads while providing permanent formwork to the concrete. Likewise, the steel tubes add confinement to the concrete whereas the concrete infill delays the local buckling of the steel tubes. This paper provides the behaviour of CFDST short columns under concentric compressive loads. The specimens studied consist of an outer skin, which is a circular hollow section (CHS), and an inner skin, which is a square hollow section (SHS), with the annulus filled with concrete while the inner tube is completely empty. A finite element (FE) analysis is generated in order to analyse the performance of such columns. Therefore, to assure the accuracy of the modelling of these specimens, FE models with concentric axial loads are developed and compared against results from past experiments. In view of this, different stress-strain curves for structural steel and concrete infill are identified, and those that provided the best curve fittings were selected for the parametric study. Accordingly, the best combination of the constitutive models of both the steel (suiting the cold-formed tubes) and the concrete (filled in double-skin tubes) is found based on previous research and considered herein. The study aims at examining the effect of various diameter-to-thickness (D

In the parametric study, high nominal compressive strengths are tested, and the steel tubes are cold-formed from different design yield strengths. Overall, this paper provides important conclusions for current circular CFDST short columns with an inner SHS and an outer CHS.Historically, the concept of “double-skin” arose from the use of composite structures in submerged tube tunnels (Zhao and Han [ The combination of the steel tubes and the annulus filled with concrete may provide several advantages over CFT such as high ductility, high bending stiffness, reduction of the structure self-weight, high local permanence due to the interaction of the three components, high global permanence due to the increase in section modulus and good cyclic performance [ The combination under this investigation is denoted as “CHS + SHS” which refers to a CHS as the outer tube and a SHS as the inner tube. This combination has seldom been experimentally investigated in literature, whereas no finite element (FE) modelling available of it. Accordingly, this paper explores the behaviour of CFDST short columns under concentric compressive loads in order to better understand the behaviour of such specimens. To understand and predict the performance of these specimens, an FE analysis was generated by using Abaqus program [ Having validated the FE models, a parametric study was then generated by Abaqus to explore the fundamental behaviour of the current columns. This parametric study aimed at examining the effects of the concrete compressive strength, the steel yield strength, the diameter-to-thickness ratio, the width-to-thickness ratio and the hollow ratio. The geometry of CFDST specimens is shown in In order to analyse and better understand the behaviour of CFDST under compressive load as well as to simulate these specimens, the FE software Abaqus [ This section describes the stress-strain relationships of the concrete infill and the structural steel that provide the best curve fittings when the FE results are compared with the test results. According to Pagoulatou et al. [ It is relevant noting that the sandwiched concrete in the CFDST short columns has a different confinement mechanism as that developed for the concrete core in CFT short columns. Radial pressures are developed at the interfaces between the (inner and outer) steel tubes and the concrete infill when the expansion of the steel tubes is exceeded by the expansion of the concrete, which is subjected to triaxial stress state. The inner skin is under a ring compression, whilst the outer skin is under hoop tension (Uenaka [ According to Saenz [ According to Pagoulatou et al. [ The following equation, which is recommended by Hu & Su [ According to Pagoulatou et al. [ In the FE analysis, the concrete material is considered as an elastic material until The stress-strain relationship for the accurate simulation of cold-formed steel tubes was obtained by using the Ramberg-Osgood model as suggested by Elchalakani et al. [ In the FE analysis, the steel material is considered as an elastic material until its yield stress. After that point, it is simulated as a plastic material. The modulus of elasticity The specimens are divided into three individual components; the outer steel jacket, the inner tube and the sandwiched concrete. According to Pagoulatou et al. [ A total of four boundary conditions were applied on each CFDST specimen as shown in The three-dimensional FE model shown in The experiments conducted by Elchalakani et al. [ From the data collection, the dimensions and materials properties of the eight CFDST specimens tested by Elchalakani et al. [ All CFDST specimens seemed to provide a slightly better performance in Abaqus than in the test experiment. However, the average of the ultimate axial strength ratios was very close to unity, meaning that the results obtained from the Abaqus-modelled specimens are considered very accurate when compared with the test specimen results. The axial load-displacement relationships for specimens C1S1 and C2S1 showed similar post-peak behaviour and ultimate loads. The comparison of the final shape of these two specimens demonstrated that both the axial shortening and the buckling, which occurred around the same height, are very close to the test results. Specimens C3S1 and C4S1 demonstrated a slightly different behaviour after the ultimate axial capacity was reached. However, both the ultimate axial capacity and the ultimate load were within 99% of the measured values. Specimen C5S2 showed a significantly different elastic-behaviour. According to Elchalakani et al. [ In this parametric study, 20 columns were firstly investigated to explore the fundamental behaviour of axially-loaded CFDST when examining the effect of various diameter-to-thickness ratios, width-to-thickness ratios, material properties and hollow ratios. CFDST composite short columns were analysed with different concrete compressive strengths. In the FE analysis, the concrete compressive strength was taken as 60, 100, 140 and 180 MPa as shown in Group 1 “1 (CS)” in As shown in Group 2 “2 (SS)” in In order to study the effects of The performance of CFDST specimens was analysed by examining the influence of the The hollow ratio ( This paper provides the behaviour of the concrete-filled double-skin composite columns for the use in onshore and offshore applications, which have the ability to produce members with very high load-bearing capacities with relatively low weight compared with the conventional concrete-filled tubes. A finite element (FE) analysis was generated to analyse and predict the behaviour of concrete-filled double-skin composite short columns under concentric axial loads. The precision of the modelling was verified by developing FE models and comparing them with the results of previous experiments carried out by the authors and published elsewhere. Three parameters were considered to compare the test specimens with the Abaqus-modelled specimens, the ultimate axial strength, axial load-displacements curves and the final deformation of the specimens. A total of twenty columns were firstly investigated and modelled in Abaqus to explore the fundamental behaviour of CFDST columns under axial compression. The parameters considered in the parametric study were the concrete compressive strength, the steel yield stress, the diameter-to-thickness ratio, the width-to-thickness ratio and the hollow ratio. Overall, the following conclusions can be drawn based on the FE results of this study: A 50% increase in the ultimate concentric axial strength can be achieved by increasing the concrete compressive strength 3 times. Increasing the steel yield stress significantly improves the axial capacity of CFDST short columns. However, the specimens become more brittle and exhibit a sudden failure mode. The maximum axial strength of CFDST specimens decreases as the The width-to-thickness ( The axial capacity of CFDST short columns seems to be affected as the hollow ratio increases. The specimen with a hollow ratio ( Finally, the cyclic effects, which are very relevant for offshore structures, on this type of columns should be investigated further. Further studies on the effect of load introduction on CFDST columns with beam connections to their sides should be conducted.  cross-sectional area of concrete nominal cross section area of concrete, given by cross-sectional area of the composite section cross-sectional area of the outer steel tube and the sandwiched concrete cross-sectional area of the inner steel tube cross-sectional area of the outer steel tube outside width of the inner steel tube width-to-thickness ratio of CFDST concrete-filled double-skin steel tube concrete-filled steel tube circular hollow section outside diameter of the outer steel tube diameter-to-thickness ratio of CFDST concrete modulus of elasticity modulus of elasticity of confined concrete steel modulus of elasticity stress values the unconfined concrete cylinder compressive strength the confined concrete compressive stress yield strength of the inner steel tube yield strength of the outer steel tube Steel ultimate strength Steel yield strength radius of gyration of CFDST moment of inertia of CFDST cross-section enhancement factors of concrete taken as 4.1 and 20.5, respectively the material degradation factor effective buckling length of column in the plane of bending moment capacity of the inner steel tube bending moment capacity of CFDST Ramberg-Osgood coefficient compressive capacity of the inner steel tube compressive capacity of the outer steel tube and the sandwiched concrete axial load capacity of CFDST ultimate axial strength of CFDST from the experimental tests ultimate axial strength of CFDST from the finite element analysis reduction factor that considers the effect of concrete strength minimal radius of gyration of CFDST parameter dependent upon parameter related to parameter in defining the stress-strain relationship of confined concrete parameter in defining the stress-strain relationship of confined concrete square hollow section nominal aggregate size used in the concrete mix wall thickness of the outer steel tube wall thickness of the inner steel tube section modulus of the outer steel tube and the sandwiched concrete plastic section modulus of the inner steel tube nominal steel ratio steel ratio hollow section ratio, given by slenderness ratio confinement factor strain values the unconfined stress corresponding to the confined strain corresponding to strain at rupture plastic strain at maximum tension load true strain values Cauchy stress true stress values yield slenderness limit in AS4100 [
