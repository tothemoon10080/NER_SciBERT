In the last decade, high-performance Cu2Se thermoelectric materials and devices are attracting increasing research interest. In this review, we firstly summarize fundamentals of Cu2Se, including crystal structure, band structure, phase transition, and intrinsic thermoelectric performance. Then, we compare and overview the effectiveness of enhancing electrical transports and reducing lattice thermal conductivity on boosting figure of merit, zT of Cu2Se and found that zT enhancement of Cu2Se should be mainly attributed to reduced lattice thermal conductivity. After that, we highlight the chemical stability and mechanical properties of Cu2Se and its thermoelectric modules. In the end, we point out future research directions in the field of Cu2Se thermoelectrics. This review fills the gap of overview on the progress and challenge of Cu2Se thermoelectrics, and provide a new perspective to achieve Cu2Se-based thermoelectric materials with high thermoelectric performance.Nowadays, ever-increasing expectations has been placed on the emission-, vibration- and noise-free thermoelectrics to mitigate the global energy crisis [ To increase the competitivity of thermoelectrics in industrial applications, Cu Below ∼400 K, the stable phase of Cu When the temperature approaches the phase transition temperature, re-ordering of Cu atoms occurs and monoclinic Cu Crystal structure difference between antifluorite Cu To better understand the band structure of antifluorite Cu The phase transition from monoclinic Cu Although, the evidence of λ-shape peak of Other than the traditional monoclinic to antifluorite Cu The superionicity of Cu The superionicity of antifluorite Cu Material engineering can further change the superionicity of Cu The crystal structure, electronic band structure, phase-transition behavior and superionicity of Cu In 2013, Liu et al.

Under such a condition, the solvent can dissolve most precursors and boost the crystal growth of as-expected products. Additionally, during this process, the morphology and size of as-grown crystals can be better controlled, especially when surfactants are properly used. During the crystal growth process, the surfactants attach on the surface of the as-grown crystals, refrain crystal growth and subsequently limit the grain size to nanoscale. By using solvothermal method and employing Polyvinylpyrrolidone as the surfactant (schematically shown in Compared to micron-sized Cu Other than bottom-up solvothermal method, high-energy ball-milling process can also synthesize nano-sized Cu The interphase interfaces can also effectively scatter phonons to reduce Other than traditional defects, such as dense grain boundaries, point defects, interphase interfaces Point defects, grain boundaries, and interphase interfaces mainly reduce High electrical performance is necessary to secure high Among the above strategies effective in refraining Point defects can also influence Nano-engineering induced dense grain boundaries and compositing induced interphase interfaces can also influence The strategies discussed above can also enhance the near room-temperature Other than the material-based thermoelectric performance, the physical properties of Cu Although Cu Recently, Qiu et al.
