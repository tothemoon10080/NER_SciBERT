The zinc content of Blast Furnace (BF) and Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) dusts and sludges is relatively high, however is generally not economically to treat these residues to recover zinc. Taking into account that they have a high iron content, removal of zinc would allow economical recovery of the iron values. On the other hand, due the increasing rate of incorporation of galvanized steel, the dusts collected in Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) installation present very high content of zinc and lead.
                  The processing aspects of this research, investigated:
