An analysis of 552 structures of metal complexes of alkyl and arylphosphinates in the Cambridge Crystallographic Database shows that the phosphinate ligating group is remarkably versatile and is able to adopt ten different binding motifs in both mono- and polynuclear complexes in which an individual phosphinate group can bind to up to five metal atoms. The majority of both homo- and heteroleptic complexes contain MOPR2
                     OM units in oligomeric and polymeric structures. In many heteroleptic complexes ligands containing hydrogen bond donors form strong bonding interactions with the phosphinate, generating pseudochelated structures. Similar pseudochelates, −OPR2
                     O⋯HOPR2
                     O, are formed when both a phosphinate and its parent phosphinic acid are coordinated to a single metal atom. Such structures feature also in the solution chemistry involved in metal extraction processes using phosphinate ligands. As might be expected, many of the binding motifs found in phosphinate complexes are similar to those in carboxylate complexes but there are fewer examples of phosphinates being used to form metal organic frameworks.Dialkyl and diarylphosphinates (R Their ability to form stable complexes in The aim of this review of solid-state structures is to identify the preferred types of coordination shown by Given the versatility of phosphinate ligands, a number of different binding modes might be expected. The more obvious motifs involving monomeric phosphinate ligands (R Structural motifs in which a metal ion is bound to an oxygen atom carrying a proton (an example is shown in Ten of the eighteen possible modes of coordination shown in By far the most common binding mode is the dinucleating form, 2.11, marked as motif The binding mode 1.1001 (motif The phosphinate binding mode found in solid-state structures depends greatly on the nature of the metal in the complex and on what other ligands are present. Structures are reviewed in Sections The simplest mode of binding, using the monodentate (mononucleating) 1.10 binding mode (motif The 1.10 motif ( A feature of motif The other possible mononucleating mode for phosphinate ligands is the chelating 1.11 motif, The only examples of the 2.20 phosphinate motif ( The symmetrical μ The only examples of dinuclear complexes in the CSD which contain just The three trinuclear complexes shown in In the tetranuclear tin complex [Cl The dinucleating motif The tetranuclear complex [(μ In the tetranuclear manganese complex, [(μ There are several other cubane-type and related phosphinate structures in the CSD and examples of some of the variations of structures of this type are shown in The Mn The versatility of the bridging motif The are no examples of large “wheel-type” oligomeric complexes similar to those formed by carboxylates Eleven compounds in the CSD contain simple trinucleating phosphinates. Only one, [(μ The unsymmetrical trinucleating motif The only examples of phosphinates functioning as tetranucleating ligands are found in the silver(I) complexes [(μ A phosphinate functioning as a pentanucleating ligand is found in three complexes Diphenylphosphinate also displays motif As mentioned earlier, we have chosen not to discuss at length the structures of complexes formed by potentially chelating diphosphinic acids such as L L In many complexes of polyphosphinates the individual phosphinate groups also fulfil bridging roles and display many of the polynucleating motifs listed in The incorporation of two phosphinic acid groups in the The 1.1001 motif ( Whilst motif Homoleptic complexes containing the 1.1001 (motif There is one other binding motif which can be found in the CSD for a dimeric form of a phosphinic acid. As in the 1.1001 motif discussed above, the 2.2001 motif ( The association of coordinated phosphinic acid and phosphinate molecules in metal complexes is favoured by the strong H-bond donor/acceptor capabilities of the former/latter. As mentioned earlier, many heteroleptic complexes which contain ligands with appropriately positioned H-bond donor groups are stabilised by these bonding to phosphinate oxygen atoms (see for example [Ru(L The strong H-bond acceptor capability of phosphinates also allows them to act as “outer sphere” ligands. An example An analysis of the 552 structures of complexes in the CSD has revealed that phosphinate ligands show 10 different modes of coordination to metal ions. Their versatility is manifest by their ability to form complexes with metal cations from all regions of the periodic table. High nuclearity complexes are more prevalent with “hard” Bridging to generate oligomeric or polymeric complexes is more common than the formation of mononuclear complexes. There are only 3 examples of the latter in which a phosphinate forms a 4-membered chelate ( The most common binding mode, motif The structural motifs of phosphinate ligands listed in Diesters of phosphoric acid, (RO) We thank the
