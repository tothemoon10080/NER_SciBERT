The jig is efficient in separating relatively low density particles such as plastics; however conventional discharge devices attached to jigs cause mechanical disruption of the stratified layers at the outlet from the separation chamber, and decrease the grade of the recovered bottom layer product. A new device was developed for efficiently separating high grade bottom layer product, better than 99%, where particles of the bottom and top layers are recovered as overflow products by agitation with water pulsation.Jig separation is a common gravity concentration method in mineral processing and today it is in widespread use because of its high separation efficiency, cost effectiveness, and high throughput rate ( Mechanical extractors such as rotating extractors are used to recover particles of the bottom layer in the RETAC and hybrid jigs. When the specific gravity of particles is less than 1.5, stratified bottom layers at the outlet from the separation chamber are disturbed by the extractor, decreasing the grade of the recovered bottom layer products. This paper describes a newly developed device, by which particles of the stratified bottom layer are moved by the water pulsation in the jig separator and recovered as overflow product of high grade from a specially equipped bottom product recovering chamber, and particles of the top layers overflow and are recovered from the separation chamber. Feed plastics used in the verification experiments here were polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polycarbonate (PC), all in cylindrical shape of 2–3 The bench scale continuous RETAC jig (R&E Co., Japan) shown in Jig experiments were conducted under conditions of 30 As shown in Jig experiments for the PC–PVC mixture were conducted under conditions of 30  For recovering a higher PVC grade of the bottom layer product, a new discharge device was developed as shown in The authors have developed a new device for attachment to a jig separator to recover light particles such as plastics. Conventional discharge devices attached to jigs cause mechanical disruption to the stratified layers at the outlet from the separation chamber, and decrease the grade of recovered bottom layer product. With the new device water pulsation and flow are used to advance particles of the stratified layer and there is no mechanical extractor. The jig separation tests of the PC–PVC mixture using the device were carried out, and the top and bottom layer products better than 99% grade were recovered.
