Literature data for gold dissolution in ammoniacal copper(II) thiosulfate solutions is reinterpreted on the basis of adsorption and mixed potential theory. The dissolution reaction appears to take place via the adsorption of copper(II)–ammonia–thiosulfate onto the gold surface, forming the adsorbed species ⊢Au(S2O3)
