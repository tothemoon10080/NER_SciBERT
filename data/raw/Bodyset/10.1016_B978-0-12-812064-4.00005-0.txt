Mineral formation in the modern oceans can take place over millions of years as a result precipitation from ambient ocean water, or orders of magnitude more rapidly from hydrothermal activity related to magmatic and tectonic processes. Here, we review associations between transform faults and related fracture zones and marine minerals. We define marine transform faults as strike-slip or oblique faults that accommodate lateral offsets along plate boundaries or shifting crustal blocks, and fracture zones as relicts of transform faulting extending beyond mid-ocean ridge offsets. We consider specifically the modern ocean and exclude regions where the transform or fracture has clearly not generated the mineral deposit, such as the Clarion-Clipperton fracture zone manganese nodule field. As a result, the summarized deposits are mainly hydrothermal in origin.
               Oceanic transform faulting has rarely been considered of interest for the mineralization and formation of ore deposits; however, there are locations in the modern oceans where transform faults and fracture zones are spatially related to mineral deposits. These occurrences suggest that transform faulting and fracture zones may be linked to mineralization at (A) intersections with other tectonic features, (B) where transform faults begin to resemble rifts through intra-transform crustal thinning, spreading, and the formation of pull-apart basins, and (C) as a result of serpentinization reactions due to exposure of deep-seated rocks by fracturing and faulting.            We thank Dr. Isobel Yeo and Dr. Maureen Walton for their constructive reviews that significantly improved the chapter. We also thank Dr. João Duarte for his editorial work and the invitation to contribute to this volume. Hydrothermal circulation and venting may produce hydrothermal mineral deposits at and below the ocean floor. Sulfide deposits commonly form proximal to the source of venting, and oxides form farther afield or in cooler systems. Of these, seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposits are of economic interest, primarily for copper, zinc, gold, and silver ( The link between faulting and mineralization has been frequently discussed, and the majority of both oceanic and terrestrial hot springs are associated with some manner of local faulting (e.g., Transform faults and fracture zones are typically not considered relevant to mineralization because “except where ‘leaky,’ they have no magmatism associated with them” ( Although transform faults are typically amagmatic, exploration in the modern oceans has identified transform faults that do have active volcanism ( One further possibility for the transform-related mineralization is the precipitation of Fe-Mn oxides on hard rock surfaces. Hydrogenetic Fe-Mn oxides occur everywhere in the deep ocean where rock crops out and is not specific to nor genetically related to transform faults. However, hydrogenetic crusts that form near hydrothermal systems can have a hydrothermal component, with some fraction of the Mn or Fe sourced from vent fields. This is common along the MAR, including along transform faults and fracture zones (e.g., Here, we reconsider the assumption that transform faults and fracture zones have no relation to mineral deposits by reviewing associations between known mineral deposits, transform faults, and fracture zones ( The majority of known transform and fracture associated mineralization on the MAR occurs at the ridge intersection. Some early observations of hydrothermal mineralization along the MAR were suggested to be related to transform faulting. Although faulting dominates the formation of large mineral deposits on the MAR (e.g., TAG), the mineralization is mostly attributed to transfer faults that cross the spreading axis ( Serpentinization occurs at a number of locations along the MAR where seawater interacts with ultramafic rocks. Most notable of these locations is the Lost City vent field, occurring on the Atlantis massif, between the Atlantis transform fault and the MAR (  The eastern Manus basin is a developing pull-apart basin that consists of a zone of grabens within the greater Manus Basin back-arc system ( Peggy ridge is the only transform fault that occurs in the central Lau basin and links to the Central Lau Spreading Center via the Lau Extensional Transform Zone ( The Finch-Langdon fault ( The Gulf of California contains a series of en echelon transform faults and associated basins and separates the Baja peninsula from mainland Mexico ( Farther north in the Gulf of California, the Consag, and Wagner pull-part basins exhibit active gas seepage, accompanied by authigenic barite, dolomite, calcite, aragonite, and pyrite ( Continuing northward from Guaymas basin onto the continent, the Salton Sea is a transitional pull-apart basin between the Gulf of California and the San Andreas Fault and has been extending for less than half a million years ( If the amagmatic nature of transform faults is maintained as the reason that these faults lack mineralization, then leaky transform faults tapping into a magmatic source should be considered as potential sites of mineralization. The Tuzo Wilson Volcanic Field, named for the discoverer of transform faulting ( The Garrett, Raitt, and Siqueiros transforms on the East Pacific Rise are all undergoing intra-transform volcanism. The Garrett transform is undergoing intra-transform extension ( Pull-apart basins begin as a result of transform-related tectonics and may culminate as rift zones ( The Blanco fracture zone displays thinned crust but is not yet spreading, and only low-temperature, diffuse, hydrothermal mineralization has been observed in the East Blanco Depression, although higher-temperature mineralization has been inferred ( It appears that transform faulting can result in conditions favorable to hydrothermal venting but does not result in commonalities differentiating transform related, pull-apart basin-hosted hydrothermal systems from other hydrothermal systems. The geochemical signatures of these systems are related to host-rock composition, local tectonics, and basin geometry, rather than commonalities as a result of transform faulting. The crustal thinning or incipient spreading occurring in pull-apart basins makes these the most likely of transform-related features to contain hydrothermally related mineralization, although exploration in such basins may be hampered by sediment fill in the depressions. The Lost City hydrothermal vent field, which defined a new type of hydrothermal venting dominated by carbonates and magnesium hydroxides, occurs as a result of exothermic reactions between ultramafic rocks and ocean water, known as serpentinization. Gabbro and peridotites are typical lower oceanic crustal rocks exposed along oceanic fracture zones and at their intersection with extensional core complexes exposed by detachment faulting ( Mineralization at transform faults and fracture zones can occur in three ways: (1) Circulation of hydrothermal fluids and deposition of sulfide/sulfate/oxide deposits; at these sites, tectonism and mineralization are synchronous and hydrothermal-style SMS deposits may occur. Sites such as these are the focus of this chapter. (2) Precipitation of Fe-Mn oxides on hard rock surfaces, which is nonspecific to transform faulting if hydrogenetic in origin, or may contain a hydrothermal component that can be transform-related, as identified along the MAR (e.g., Regarding deposits formed through the circulation of hydrothermal fluids, point (1) above, our compilation indicates that mineralization as a result of hydrothermal activity related to transform faults and fracture zones is likely to be most common in pull-apart basins, including those that evolve into nascent spreading centers. In addition, mineralization occurs at the intersection of transform faults and other tectonic features, especially spreading centers as has been previously noted ( Transform faults may be of more interest for generation of hydrocarbons as a result of sediment transformations or serpentinization, than for generation of base and critical metals ore deposits. However, ore deposits do occur along transform faults and fracture zones on the continents, for example gold-mercury deposits at the McLaughlin mine in northern California, where hydrocarbons also occur (e.g.,
