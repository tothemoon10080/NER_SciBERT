In this paper, dual-complex k-Fibonacci numbers are defined. Also, some algebraic properties of dual-complex k-Fibonacci numbers which are connected with dual-complex numbers and k-Fibonacci numbers are investigated. Furthermore, the Honsberger identity, the d’Ocagne’s identity, Binet’s formula, Cassini’s identity, Catalan’s identity for these numbers are given.Many kinds of generalizations of the Fibonacci sequence have been presented in the literature. In 2007, the k-Fibonacci sequence Here, In 2010, Bolat and Köse In 2015, Polatlı Kızılateş and Kesim In the 19 th century Clifford invented a new number system by using the notation Dual-complex numbers The real and dual quaternions form a division algebra, but dual-complex numbers form a commutative ring with characteristics 0. Moreover, the multiplication of these numbers gives the dual-complex numbers the structure of 2-dimensional complex Clifford Algebra and 4-dimensional real Clifford Algebra. The base elements of the dual-complex numbers satisfy the following commutative multiplication scheme ( Five different conjugations can operate on dual-complex numbers In this paper, the dual-complex k-Fibonacci numbers and the dual-complex k-Lucas numbers will be defined respectively, as follows The aim of this work is to present in a unified manner a variety of algebraic properties of the dual-complex k-Fibonacci numbers as well as both the dual-complex numbers and k-Fibonacci numbers. In particular, using five types of conjugations, all the properties established for dual-complex numbers are also given for the dual-complex k-Fibonacci numbers. In addition, Binet’s Formula, the Honsberger identity, the d’Ocagne’s identity, Cassini’s identity and Catalan’s identity for these numbers are given. The dual-complex k-Fibonacci and k-Lucas numbers can be define by with the basis {1, Then, the addition and subtraction of the dual-complex k-Fibonacci numbers are defined by The multiplication of a dual-complex k-Fibonacci number by the real scalar The multiplication of two dual-complex Fibonacci numbers is defined by Five kinds of conjugation can be defined for dual-complex numbers In the following theorem, some properties related to the conjugations of the dual-complex k-Fibonacci numbers are given.      Therefore, the norm of the dual-complex k-Fibonacci number In the following theorem, some properties related to the dual-complex k-Fibonacci quaternions are given.               Binet’s formula of the dual-complex k-Fibonacci number is the same as Binet’s formula of the k-Fibonacci number     In this study, a number of new results on dual-complex k-Fibonacci numbers were derived. Dual-complex k-Fibonacci numbers have great importance as they are used in quantum physics, applied mathematics, quantum mechanics, Lie groups, kinematics and differential equations. This study fills the gap in the literature by providing the dual-complex k-Fibonacci number using definitions of the dual-complex number
