The internal shape of planetary ball mill jars was modified to increase the efficiency of the milling process. Four new jar designs are presented, where obstacles on the surface of a traditional cylindrical jar modify the ratio of normal-to-tangential transferred mechanical action, thus improving the comminution of the mill charge and reducing the process time. Multibody dynamics simulations, validated by operando video recordings of the process, were employed to investigate modified ball motion regimes promoting the increase of the number of high-energy impacts. Moreover, experimental grinding of calcium fluoride powder was performed to assess the effect of milling time and jar-to-plate velocity ratio, through the evaluation of size and microstrain of the end product deduced from X-ray diffraction line profile analysis.Planetary ball mill is a widely used apparatus to process almost any class of material, from metals and ceramics to organic compounds and pharmaceuticals The geometry of the device and its working principle are rather simple, with grinding occurring by impacts between milling media (balls and jar) and mill charge (see Preliminary insights on the effectiveness of this variable are reported in In a planetary ball mill two or more rotating (with angular velocity Trajectories of balls strictly relate to the setup of mill operational parameters, which determine whether they roll and slide or swirly cross the grinding chamber. Different motion regimes can therefore be recognized and, the more disordered they are, the higher the number and the intensity of the impacts The Half-Moon (HM) shape ( Newly designed jars were investigated through experiments performed in a planetary ball mill Fritsch Pulverisette 4 (P4, 12 carbon steel balls were placed inside stainless steel jars (geometrical and physical properties of the milling media as well as the internal volume of the jars are reported in For every jar, experiments were performed on calcium fluoride (CaF Ball motion inside the jars was monitored New designed jars were tested through a multibody dynamics numerical model, developed within the framework of MSC.Adams software Both for the ball-ball and the ball-jar impacts, the generalised stiffness Friction at contact location was taken into account through the hard-coded regularised formulation of the Coulomb model The Hilbert-Hughes-Taylor (HHT, In addition to the quantities characterising the motion of each body, also deducible from camera recordings, simulations output provided the complete description of contact events, largely inaccessible to experiments and of utmost importance for properly tuning the properties of the end product. In particular, in this work, the relative velocity of colliding bodies, divided into normal (axial) and tangential components with respect to the local impact reference frame, was exploited for the estimate of the average kinetic energy available. The effect of grinding on the calcium fluoride powder was assessed by X-ray Powder Diffraction Line Profile Analysis (XRPD-LPA, In the first part of this section, the effect of re-designing the jar shape is investigated in terms of ball motion, energy exchange and grinding performance, together with its dependence on the jar-to-plate velocity ratio ( Several works in literature While the most significative movies can be found in Supplementary Material, selected pictures giving insights on motion modes detected for the CY and the 3L jars are reported in Simulations provided also the relative velocity of colliding bodies. A simple parameter proposed by several authors Due to the complexity of phenomena taking place during the ball milling process that can not be accounted for by the proposed model – e.g. changes in powder structure and morphology, heat transfer etc. –, the amount of energy effectively transferred to the mill feed is hardly estimable. Consequently, as proposed in literature Furthermore it should be noticed that, within the proposed simulation framework, a continuous contact scheme is adopted to describe the collisions – i.e. the duration of the impact is assumed to be finite and not instantaneous – and therefore each contact is sampled by a certain amount of calculation points. The amount of points is however not known For each tested For the steel-steel case, both the normal and the tangential average impact energy components present a maximum peaked at What is even more important to note is that the average energy density in normal direction ( Validation of these predictions was addressed by WPPM analysis of experimental XRPD patterns collected for fluorite samples ground for 32 h under different velocity ratios, suppling the average crystallite dimensions Experimental data reported in To validate this hypothesis, the CY and the HM jars (the latter chosen as representative of all the new design jars) were experimentally tested under six different milling times (1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 16 h, 32 h and 64 h). Experiments with fluorite were performed for two velocity ratios, namely For the condition At Therefore it should be highlighted that, when operating under favourable mill configuration, the HM jar (as well as the other new design jars) needs much shorter milling time than the CY to produce a well-ground end product. Jars with modified shape can therefore shorten the overall duration of the grinding process, saving time and energy. Besides size reduction, XRPD-LPA provided information on the dislocation density  Wear is intuitively expected to increase with milling time and Four new designs of the internal shape of the planetary ball mill jar were designed to enhance comminution efficiency of the grinding process. This was achieved by introducing different obstacles along the surface of the standard cylindrical vial. The new jars were investigated by multibody dynamics simulations validated by Finally, the effect of milling time was investigated for the CY and the HM jars, the latter chosen as representative of the new design jars. LPA of calcium fluoride milled for different times pointed out that the HM jar yields a well ground end product in milling time as short as 1 h, whereas the traditional CY requires at least 16 h to give a similar result, even when best operating conditions are used. Jar shape is therefore a crucial variable for the reduction of time and energy required by the milling process.
