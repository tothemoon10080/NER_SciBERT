The experimental results of a leaching process of different manganiferous ores are here reported. The leaching treatment showed a satisfactory selectivity of manganese extraction in comparison of other metals such as Al, Si and Na.
                  XRD analyses have been done on the ores before and after the leaching treatment.
                  The experimental results showed a good technical feasibility of the process which can use alternative feedstocks (containing carbohydrates) to treat different manganese ores.
