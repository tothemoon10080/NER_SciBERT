In this research work, α-Fe2O3 nano-particles were prepared by direct thermal-decomposition of γ-Fe2O3. Precursor powders (γ-Fe2O3) were synthesized by wet chemical method at room temperature and then, the precursors were subsequently calcined in air for 1h at 500°C. Samples were characterized by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectra (EDS), infrared spectrum (IR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. The XRD, EDS, and IR results indicated that the synthesized α-Fe2O3 particles were pure. The TEM image showed that the α-Fe2O3 nano-particles were spherical and 18±2nm in size. Magnetic properties have been detected by a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) at room temperature. The γ-Fe2O3 and α-Fe2O3 nano-particles exhibited a super-paramagnetic and weak ferromagnetic behavior at room temperature, respectively. Using the present method, hematite nano-particles can be produced without expensive organic solvent and complicated equipment.Nano-particles have become the focus of modern materials science because of their potential technological importance which stems from their unique physical properties Maghemite nano-particles were prepared by wet chemical method at room temperature according to Ref. Thermogravimetric (TG) and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analyses are shown in In this study it was shown that, α-Fe
