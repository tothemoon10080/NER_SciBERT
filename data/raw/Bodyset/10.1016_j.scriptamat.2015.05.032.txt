In this paper, the feasibility of producing Ti-6Al-4V with a range of wrought-like microstructures and mechanical properties via a novel powder metallurgy (PM) process with simple heat treatments is investigated. The wrought-like PM Ti-6Al-4V is obtained by sintering blended elemental (BE) powder in a hydrogen atmosphere, followed by conventional Ti-6Al-4V heat treating profiles. This is achieved without resorting to energy-intensive thermomechanical processing (TMP) that is compulsory for producing high performance titanium alloys via wrought processing or traditional powder metallurgy.Currently, wrought processing is the state of the art for producing Ti alloys with microstructures and mechanical properties necessary for critical applications. However, wrought Ti is prohibitively expensive for use in most commercial applications, due to the multi-step, energy-intensive, thermomechanical processing (TMP) routes used. Additionally, many Ti components have high buy-to-fly ratios. Because of this, powder metallurgy (PM) has long been sought as a means to reduce the cost of Ti alloys, owing to its near-net-shape (NNS) capabilities Specifically to PM Ti, the key to achieve mechanical properties that can match that of wrought Ti while maintaining the low-cost advantage is to find a way to produce wrought-like microstructures without using pressure-assisted sintering processes or relying on TMP, which is energy-intensive and incompatible with the NNS nature of PM. This objective can be achieved only by using low-cost powder, blended elemental alloying, near-net-shape compaction, and pressure-less sintering processes that can deliver the desired microstructures in the as-sintered or heat-treated state. Achieving this goal would be a breakthrough that could transform the Ti industry. Hydrogen sintering and phase transformation (HSPT) is a new, low-cost, blended elemental (BE), press and sinter process for producing titanium alloys from hydrogenated Ti powder. The current authors have previously demonstrated the ability of HSPT to produce Ti-6Al-4V with over 99% relative density, an ultrafine grain (UFG) microstructure, and extraordinary mechanical properties in the as-sintered state In the current study, the feasibility of applying simple heat treatments to as-sintered HSPT Ti-6Al-4V in order to generate a range of wrought-like microstructures and mechanical properties is investigated. The heat treatments used in this study were borrowed from wrought processing. Such heat treatments would normally be preceded by thermomechanical work  Detailed descriptions of the powder preparation and compaction methods as well as the furnaces used in this study are available in the Sintering was performed using either HSPT ( Heat treatments were performed on both HSPT-sintered and vacuum-sintered specimens, using one of the two thermal profiles shown schematically in        The mechanisms by which the microstructure evolves during heat treatments of HSPT Ti-6Al-4V are not yet conclusively known. However, it is hypothesized that the high surface energy of the UFG microstructure provides sufficient driving force to form globularized α and β grains at the treatment temperature. When the material is quenched, the globularized α grains remain and the β grains transform into acicular grains. The aspect ratio of the grains that form during cooling is a function of the diffusion path length of the alloying elements during partitioning (i.e. cooling rate). Therefore, when the material is cooled slowly, the β grains transform into α grains with a relatively low aspect ratio. Additionally, it is known that TiH It is believed that the microstructure resulting from vacuum sintering is too coarse and not conducive to forming the globularized α To determine the correlation between structure and properties of HSPT Ti-6Al-4V, quasi-static tensile tests were performed on HSPT samples with the as-sintered, bi-modal, and “globularized” microstructures shown in The microstructure shown in It should be pointed out that, even though HSPT Ti alloys have a very high sintered density, there will always be residual porosities in the as-sintered state. Porosity has important implications for the mechanical properties of PM alloys, especially fatigue performance. Therefore, methods to remove the residual porosity are currently being investigated. One of these approaches is to subject the as-sintered samples to gaseous isostatic forging (GIF). GIF is a rapid, low-cost, NNS-compatible process that uses rapid heating and isostatic pneumatic pressure to close residual porosity In conclusion, the results of this work demonstrate that wrought-like microstructures and mechanical properties can indeed be produced using the PM method described herein. The wrought-like PM Ti is obtained by sintering blended elemental powder in a hydrogen atmosphere, followed by conventional Ti-6Al-4V heat treating profiles. It was found that the ability to produce wrought-like PM Ti-6Al-4V is unique to HSPT, as vacuum sintering did not produce the same results after heat treatment. As such, these results indicate the potential for HSPT to be the first truly viable low-cost alternative to wrought processing for producing high performance Ti alloys.
