In this study, aluminum alloy (Al-2 wt% Cu) matrix composites reinforced with 1, 2 and 4 wt% boron carbide nanoparticles fabricated through mechanical milling with average size of 100 nm were fabricated via stir casting method at 850°C. Cast ingots of the matrix alloy and the composites were extruded at 500°C at an extrusion ratio of 10:1 to investigate the effects of hot extrusion on the mechanical properties of the composites. The microstructures of the as-cast and the extruded composites were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Density measurement, hardness and tensile tests were carried out to identify the mechanical properties of the composites. The extruded samples revealed a more uniform distribution of B4C nanoparticles. Also, the extruded samples had strength and ductility values superior to those of the as-cast counterparts. In the as-cast and the extruded samples, with increasing amount of B4C nanoparticles, yield strength and tensile strength increased but elongation to fracture decreased.
