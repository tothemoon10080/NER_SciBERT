Surface free energies of dental hard tissues, including salivary conditioning films on enamel, play a crucial role in mineralization, dissolution and adhesion processes at the tooth surface. These mineralization reactions at oral surfaces control the development and progression of various diseases. In this paper, we compare the surface free energies, as derived from measured contact angles with liquids, of salivary conditioning films on enamel after exposure to dentifrices with and without anti-calculus additives, such as hexametaphosphate, pyrophosphate or zinc citrate trihydrate. Measured contact angles were converted to surface free energies using the concept of Lifshitz–Van der Waals and Lewis acid–base components. Nearly all dentifrices yield film properties with a negative interfacial tension against an aqueous phase, which thermodynamically opposes mineralization. Concurrent with negative interfacial tensions, are positive values of the interfacial free energy of adhesion for octacalcium–phosphate (OCP) to the film surfaces, indicating that adhesion of newly mineralized, calcium–phosphate rich phases is thermodynamically unfavorable. Interestingly, two out of the three dentifrices with anti-calculus additives containing hexametaphosphate and pyrophosphate cause most positive interfacial free energies for OCP adhesion of 5.8 and 2.6mJ/m2, respectively. In summary, surface thermodynamical analyses indicate that anti-calculus effects of commercial dentifrice formulations are consistent with more negative interfacial tensions of salivary conditioning films on enamel surfaces and thus with more positive values for the interfacial free energy of adhesion toward newly formed mineral phases. A dentifrice containing hexametaphosphate yielded thermodynamic properties of salivary conditioning films most unfavorable for calculus formation.Dental calculus forms as a result of the calcification of dental plaque (or biofilm) both above (supra) and below (sub) the tooth-gingival margin. Supragingival calculus formation interferes with regular oral hygiene and promotes gingival recession, while subgingival calculus may in part contribute to chronic inflammation of periodontal tissue Although calculus formation is in part an adhesion process between calcified plaque and the tooth surface The complete control of calculus formation has proven a difficult task. In many cases, the formation of dental calculus continues despite good oral hygiene including regular toothbrushing and flossing The aim of this paper is to compare the effects of various dentifrices, with and without anti-calculus additives on the surface free energies of salivary conditioning films on dental enamel surfaces in an effort to elucidate a fundamental thermodynamic rationale for the clinical effectiveness of a diverse array of chemical substances toward dental calculus inhibition. The dentifrices evaluated in this study are all listed in Bovine enamel blocks were sectioned, mounted on acrylic and serially polished to 0.3 Conditioning film coated enamel surfaces were examined following both brushing and rinsing with dentifrices. For brushing experiments, specimens were brushed with 25 The surface free energy of the enamel surfaces was measured after air drying to a “plateau level” of constant surface dryness, as monitored by water contact angle measurements over time These interfacial tensions can be employed to set up an interfacial tension balance   In this paper it is demonstrated that different dentifrices have different impacts on the surface free energies of salivary conditioning films on enamel. The surface free energies of the conditioning films determine mineralization processes at the enamel surface through an influence on the interfacial tension between the enamel and the surrounding aqueous phase It is additionally useful to consider that anti-calculus effects of dentifrices may result not only from direct influences on mineralization at the enamel surface, but also from the adhesivity of the enamel or conditioning film surface toward the newly formed mineral Recently, the influence of adsorption of dentifrice components on mineralization reactions of hydroxyapatite (HAP) was studied by exposing enamel surfaces to artificial saliva, supersaturated with respect to HAP after addition a dentifrice supernate In summary, surface thermodynamic analyses indicate that the clinical anti-calculus effects of commercial dentifrice formulations are generally consistent with the observation of more negative interfacial free energies of salivary conditioning films on enamel surfaces and with more positive values for the interfacial free energy of adhesion toward newly formed mineral phases. A dentifrice containing hexametaphosphate yielded thermodynamic properties of salivary conditioning films most unfavorable for calculus formation. These surface actions describe a thermodynamic rationale for the clinical efficacy of an important class of dentifrice ingredients.
