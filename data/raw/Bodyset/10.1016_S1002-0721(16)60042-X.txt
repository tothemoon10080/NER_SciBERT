In order to intensify the leaching process of rare earth (RE) and reduce the impurities in the leachate, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) were mixed as a compound leaching agent to treat the weathered crust elution-deposited RE ore. Effects of molar ratio of NH4Cl and NH4NO3, ammonium (NH4
                     +) concentration, leaching agent pH and flow rate on the leaching process of RE were studied and evaluated by the chromatographic plate theory. Leaching process of the main impurity aluminium (Al) was also discussed in detail. Results showed that a higher initial ammonium concentration in a certain range could enhance the mass transfer process of RE and Al by providing a driving force to overcome the resistance of diffusion. pH almost had no effects on the mass transfer efficiency of RE and Al in the range of 4 to 8. The relationship between the flow rate and height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP) could fit well with the Van Deemter equation, and the flow rate at the lowest HETP was determined. The optimum conditions of column leaching for RE and Al were 1:1 (molar ratio) of NH4Cl and NH4NO3, 0.2 mol/L of ammonium concentration, pH 4â€“8 of leaching agent and 0.5 mL/min of flow rate. Under this condition, the mass transfer efficiency of RE was improved, but no change was observed for Al compared with the most widely used ammonium sulfate. Moreover, the significant difference value (around 20 mL) of retention volume at the peak concentration between RE and Al provided a possibility for their separation. It suggested the potential application of the novel compound leaching agent (NH4Cl/NH4NO3). It was found that the relative concentration of RE in the leachate could be easily obtained by monitoring the pH of leachate.
