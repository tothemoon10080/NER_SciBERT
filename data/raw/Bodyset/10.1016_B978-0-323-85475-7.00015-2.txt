The pelvic ring unites three bones (the sacrum and two coxal bones) by three poorly mobile articulations (sacroiliac joints, pubic symphysis). Two functional arches can be distinguished, an anterior and a posterior, the latter bearing about 70% of the body weight.
               The transverse and frontal stability of the ring is mostly ensured by the strong posterior sacroiliac ligamentous complex. Any damages to those posterior structures are accompanied by severe instability. As a rule, if the ring is considered as a closed ring, any disruption of the anterior arch is automatically accompanied by a posterior injury until proven otherwise.
               Three main mechanisms of injury can be encountered: lateral compression, anteroposterior compression and shearing. Each mechanism generates, in different proportions, damages to the pubic branches, symphysis, sacrum and sacroiliac joints.
               Radiographs should be limited to patients in need of immediate surgical management, and CT has to be preferred in stable patients as it is more sensitive for the evaluation of posterior structures damage.Introduction Anatomy Imaging Radiographs CT MRI Ring of the pelvis Concept Stability Mechanisms of injury Classifications Young and Burgess classification Tile/AO classification Definitively stable injuries (Tile type A) Avulsions Iliac wing fractures Transverse sacral fractures Lateral compression (LC) injuries LC type 1 LC type 2 LC type 3 Anteroposterior compression (APC) injuries APC 1 APC 2 APC 3 Vertical shear injuries (Malgaigne fractures) Combined mechanisms Sacral fractures Vertical sacral fractures Horizontal sacral fractures Spinopelvic dislocation Sacral insufficiency fractures References Pelvic ring injuries range from low-energy stable fractures, especially in the elderly, to high-energy unstable and life-threatening fractures Those unstable fractures are generally seen in car accidents and are a direct reflect of the gravity of the trauma [ Unstable pelvic ring fractures increase the risk for mortality by themselves because of haemorrhage (by direct vasculature injury from osseous fragments or vessels shearing) Moreover, other life-threatening conditions such as severe head trauma (in lateral compression fractures) or visceral injuries (in anteroposterior compression injuries) fractures are associated. The mortality for pelvic ring fracture can be up to 20% depending on the type of injuries As mechanical and hemodynamic stabilities are highly dependent, the role of imaging is to best assess the remaining stability in pelvic ring trauma. The pelvis can be viewed as a closed osteoligamentous ring formed by the coxal bones and the sacrum, joined by the sacroiliac joints (SIJ) posteriorly and the pubic symphysis anteriorly ( The sacroiliac joints capsules are reinforced by: anterior SI ligaments (ASI) posterior SI ligaments (PSI) interosseous ligaments between the tuberosities of the ilium and sacrum. The PSI and interosseous ligaments form the posterior sacroiliac complex (PSC), that is the primary stabilizer of the pelvic ring The PSC is similar to a suspension bridge, with the posterior sacroiliac spines acting as the towers, the sacrum as the bridge deck, and PSI ligaments as suspending cables. Posterior ligaments work almost constantly to resist anterior displacement of the sacrum relative to the coxal bones. The pelvic ring can be divided into two arches ( an anterior arch made of the pubic rami and the pubic symphysis a posterior arch (or femorosacral arch) that includes the posterior ilium, sacrum, SIJ with ASI and PSI ligaments. The posterior arch is the keystone element of the pelvis, as it is the main weight bearing component of the pelvis and responsible for 60–85% of pelvic stability The pubic symphysis is the weakest link in the pelvic ring, responsible for only 15–40% of pelvic stability. Therefore, any involvement of the posterior arch can result in instability Besides, the sacrotuberous (ST) and sacrospinous (SS) ligaments form the pelvic floor and anchor the sacrum to the coxal bones. Radiographs remain the first-line imaging modality for the evaluation of pelvic trauma The usual examination includes three views: an AP view, and “inlet” and “outlet” oblique views obtained with ascending and descending X-ray beams (20–45° of inclination) The inlet view is perpendicular to the pelvic brim, allowing a depiction of brim interruption (coxal bones or sacrum fractures) anterior-posterior displacement of pubic rami widening of the sacroiliac joints The outlet view is grossly perpendicular to the pubic rami, and offers a better visualization of the posterior arch sacrum shape and symmetry sacral foramina width of the sacroiliac joints craniocaudal displacement Radiographs are less sensitive than CT in the detection and characterization of pelvic ring injury, especially in osteoporotic older subjects [ As a rule, radiographs must be reserved to hemodynamically unstable patients that need immediate surgery and/or interventional radiology procedure Patients with stable hemodynamic conditions must benefit from a CT examination as fast as possible in order to confirm pelvic ring involvement evaluate ring stability detect associated injuries (acetabulum, vessels, organs) MR examination is only rarely ordered in acute severe trauma, as CT is generally sufficient to guide further management. MR is preferred for the detection of occult fracture of the posterior arch in non-surgical candidates, notably elderly patients with suspicion of sacral insufficiency fractures Because the pelvis is a stable and continuous osteoligamentous ring-like structure, it theoretically cannot break in only one place. If the pelvic ring is fractured in one site, it must almost invariably be broken in another Even so, patients with an isolated anterior fracture (e.g. pubic rami fractures) on radiographs can legitimately benefit from a pelvic CT to assess a posterior injury The stability of the pelvic ring, defined as the ability of the osteoligamentous ring to sustain physiologic stresses without abnormal deformation, is the fundamental concept that determines patient management Any disruption of the pelvic ring results in instability; the degree of instability depends on the structures injured and their level of disabilities. Injuries to the pelvic ring are considered as: stable partially unstable: stable in the vertical and anteroposterior planes but unstable in the transverse plane (the ring can open) unstable: unstable in all planes/directions with potential translation Isolated symphysis injuries are considered as stable, but they are very unusual and a concomitant injury to the posterior arch must always be suspected If the pelvic floor (ST and SSp) and ASI are ruptured, a horizontal instability occurs (partial instability): the ring can be open in the transverse plane, but no posterior or craniocaudal translation is possible [ If the PSI is ruptured as well, then the pelvis is completely unstable with potential posterior or craniocaudal translation Injuries are differentiated into those that compromise the weight-bearing pelvic ring (unstable fractures) and those that spare it (stable fractures) Owing to Tile, stable fractures are: avulsions (tendons insertion sites) isolated iliac wing fractures (direct blow) transverse sacral fractures (subtypes of spinal fractures, result from falls) Fractures involving the weight-bearing pelvic ring are in the vast majority the result of a high-energy trauma, such as motorcycle accidents and motor vehicle pedestrian accidents Injuring forces induce a rotation of one or both hemipelvis, either inwards (internal rotation) or outwards (external rotation). Fractures can be either stable or unstable, depending on the degree of the posterior arch involvement Potentially unstable injuries result from three main mechanisms [ lateral compression: the most commonly encountered pattern, results from a side impact such as lateral motor vehicle collisions anteroposterior compression: results from a massive impact to the pubis, classically in motorcycle accident or in a run-over car accident shearing: results from falls from a significant height. Lateral compression is also responsible for the vast majority of hip fractures, especially in elderly, and combined acetabulum and pelvic ring injuries are common. Two main classifications of pelvic ring fractures exist: The Young and Burgess classification and the Tile/AO classification ( The Tile/AO classification is probably the most commonly used by trauma surgeons, as it allows a direct evaluation of pelvic ring instability. From an imaging point of view, the Young and Burgess classification seems easier for the understanding of injury mechanisms. The Young and Burgess classification describes fracture patterns owing to mechanisms, with subtypes of increasing instability lateral compression injuries (LC) with three subtypes (1, 2, 3) anteroposterior compression injuries (APC) with three subtypes (1, 2, 3) vertical shear (VS) combined mechanism (CM) Depending on the degree of the posterior arch disruption, the Tile/AO classification describes the injuries as [ A, stable: intact posterior arch A1: avulsion injury A2: iliac wing or anterior arch fracture due to a direct blow A3: transverse sacrococcygeal fracture B, partially stable: incomplete disruption of posterior arch, rotationally (in the axial plane) unstable but vertically stable B1: open-book injury (external rotation) B2: lateral compression injury (internal rotation) B3: bilateral C, unstable: complete disruption of posterior arch, unstable both rotationally and vertically C1: unilateral with iliac fracture, sacroiliac fracture-dislocation, or sacral fracture C2: bilateral, with type B on one side, and type C on the other C3: bilateral C Some injuries are inherently stable if they don’t affect the integrity of the posterior arch The most common avulsion sites are the anterosuperior iliac spine, the anteroinferior iliac spine and the ischial tuberosity that are the insertion sites of the sartorius, rectus femoris and hamstrings, respectively The diagnostic is generally made on the specific location of the avulsed fragment and a history of sports activities that solicit the injured muscles (shoot, sprint). In chronic phases, ectopic ossifications can occur as a consequence of the initial traumatic hematoma. They can mimic aggressive tumors, especially in children or young adults ( Isolated fractures of the iliac wing, also called Duverney fractures, are generally stable fractures as they do not disrupt the weight-bearing pelvic ring Those fractures differ from the “crescent” fractures that are posterior iliac wing fractures that involve the sacroiliac joint [ Sacral fractures can be either vertical or transverse. Those two types of fractures are different by their mechanisms, associated injuries, degrees of stability and outcomes. Transverse fractures that occur below the sacrogluteal line (below the level of the SIJ) are considered as stable. They usually result from falls and are part of spinal injuries (see section below). LC injuries usually result from a side impact in motor vehicle accident LC injuries can also be encountered in low-energy trauma, especially in elderly patients, after a fall from standing height directly on the side The compression force can be applied either directly to the ilium (iliac crest) or to the greater trochanter. An associated acetabular fracture can be found. The key sign to suspect LC injury is a fracture of the pubic rami or occasionally a “locked symphysis” (anteroposterior superimposition of both rami) [ In LC1, the posterior injury is a sacral compression fracture of various severity: buckle fracture, single fracture or comminuted fracture The posterior injury can be ipsilateral or contralateral (bucket-handle) to the anterior fracture. This posterior lesion can be challenging to detect on radiographs due to spontaneous reduction of the fractured fragments or interposed bowel gases, and CT might be required [ The PSC remains intact and LC type 1 fractures are considered stable If compressive forces continue to propagate, an iliac wing fracture or a “crescent” fracture-dislocation can occur ( In the particular case of a bilateral compression (e.g. a subject stuck between a car and a wall), both side of the pelvis can present compression injury of various severity ( LC type 2 fractures are horizontally unstable (they can be open like a book) but stable craniocaudally (intact PSC). In LC type 3, the forces involve the hemipelvis opposite to the side of the impact, and the latter opens, usually at the level of the SIJ ( Those injuries are also called a “windswept” pelvis: the pelvis on the impact side turns inwards while the contralateral pelvis is pushed outwards Lateral compression type 3 injuries are both rotationally and vertically unstable. Antero-posterior forces (APC) tend to open the pelvic ring as a book with one or both hemipelvis sustaining external rotation Common circumstances of APC injuries are [ a massive direct impact to the anterior aspect of the pubis, usually in a frontal motorcycle accident a violent external rotation of the femur when a motorcyclist’s leg gets caught on a stationary object a direct posterior blow to the pelvis, as in a posterior fall from an elevated stand, where the posterior superior iliac spines externally rotate the ilia and disrupt the pubic symphysis The key finding in APC injury is a symphyseal diastasis ( After symphysis failure, other ligamentous structures will fail in a domino-like pattern with an opening of the SIJ ( APC injuries can be challenging to thoroughly evaluate in patients with a pelvic binder, that aims explicitly to reduce symphyseal or SIJ diastasis. Injuries might therefore be over-looked and, as much as possible, CT examination is done with the binder removed ( APC type 1 injuries are theoretically isolated anterior arch injuries. The pubic symphysis is partially torn, but the diastasis is less than 2.5 cm. However, pure APC 1 injuries are rare and, as a rule, patients with any degree of symphyseal diastasis must be managed as if a posterior arch injury is also present [ In APC type 2 injuries, the symphyseal diastasis is over 2.5 cm As the force continues posteriorly, an increasing external rotation is applied to each hemipelvis, and ST, SSp (pelvic floor) and ASI ligaments sequentially disrupt Once again, as injuries tend to self-reduce, L5 transverse process fracture may be the only indicator of a posterior arch injury APC type 3 is characterized by a disruption of the PSC. The pelvic ring is wide open like a book can be (“open book” fracture) ( The SIJ is completely unstable: it can be opened (horizontal instability) as well as posteriorly or cranially displaced (vertical instability) [ On CT, the key finding of AP3 is a posterior displacement of the ilium relative to the sacrum, revealing the posterior sacroiliac disruption with a vertical instability VS injuries are highly unstable and severe injuries The injured hemipelvis is displaced vertically in the cephalad direction ( On radiographs, the iliac crest of the injured side is displaced proximally when compared to the contralateral side Besides vascular and visceral injuries, calcaneus and spinal fractures are commonly associated in VS injuries. Combined mechanisms occur in situations where multiple force vectors are simultaneous apply. CM might be therefore suspected when pelvic ring fractures exhibit features from different pattern. CM injuries are usually encountered in severe car/motorcycle accidents where the patient is ejected from the vehicle Sacral fractures are basically either traumatic fractures seen in high-energy trauma in young patients or insufficiency fractures seen in osteoporotic older patients [ Traumatic sacral fractures are usually described upon the Denis classification ( type 1: vertical fracture that is lateral to the sacral foramina (zone 1) ( type 2: vertical fracture that involves one or several foramina (zone 2) ( type 3: fracture medial to the sacral foramina and entering the spinal canal (zone 3) that can run in a vertical, oblique, or horizontal direction. Vertical fractures of the sacrum are generally seen in pelvic ring injuries They result from lateral compression with impaction of the cancellous bone of the sacrum ( shearing with a gap in the cancellous bone ( Zone 1 fractures are the most common pattern (about 50%) and have a low the rate of neurologic injury. In contrast, zone 2 fractures involve the sacral foramina and can cause neurological deficit in about ⅓ third of cases Type 3 fractures represent a heterogeneous group of injuries, ranging from stable transverse fractures to severe fractures in pelvic ring shear injuries [ Transverse fractures below the spinogluteal line (below the level of the SIJ) are stable injuries ( Transverse fractures above the spinogluteal line usually involve the SIJ forming a U-shaped (or H-shaped) sacral fracture ( Sacral insufficiency fractures usually affect individuals with osteoporosis, typically older women, and can happen with little or even no trauma Most insufficiency fractures are H- shaped, with a transverse component generally below the S2 vertebral body and an uni- or bilateral longitudinal component through sacral ala ( Fracture lines and adjacent sclerosis can be difficult to detect on both radiographs (sensitivity less than 40%) and CT (sensitivity about 70%) [ The anterior sacral cortex has to be attentively checked for subtle interruption or buckling ( MR remains the modality of choice for the detection of insufficiency fractures. It will display the typical appearance of low signal fracture lines (best seen on T1-weighted sequences) surrounded by a massive edema on fluid-sensitive sequences (
