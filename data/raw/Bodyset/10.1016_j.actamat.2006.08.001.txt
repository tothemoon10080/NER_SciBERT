It has been brought to our attention that some of the published results could not be reproduced with the values for the coefficients of the dimensionless functions given in the paper. This is because of the following typographical errors: The value of The value of The value of As it is briefly noted in Section 6 concerning practical implementation of the methodology, the accuracy in mechanical property extractions is sensitive to errors introduced in measured contact variables because of the compliances of the indenter frame and the pyramidal tip. The methodology is also sensitive to the value used for factor
