The support vector machine (SVM) is a relatively new artificial intelligence technique which is increasingly being applied to geotechnical problems and is yielding encouraging results. In this paper SVM models are developed for predicting the ultimate axial load-carrying capacity of piles based on cone penetration test (CPT) data. A data set of 108 samples is used to develop the SVM models. These data were obtained from the literature containing pile load tests and each sample contains information regarding pile geometry, full-scale static pile load tests and CPT results. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to examine the relative significance of each input variable with respect to ultimate strength prediction. Finally, a statistical analysis is conducted to make comparisons between predictions obtained from the SVM models and three traditional CPT-based methods for determining pile capacity. The comparison confirms that the SVM models developed in this paper outperform the traditional methods.pile-soil surface area cross sectional area of the pile tip pile width or diameter bias optimum bias penalty parameter covariance between the model output ( degree of polynomial kernel measured (observed) output mean of the observed output ( unit shaft resistance (de Ruiter and Beringen cone sleeve friction in CPT average cone sleeve friction average cone sleeve friction along first, second and third segment of the embedded length of the pile regression function kernel function penetrometer capacity factor (Bustamante and Gianeselli loss function embedded length of pile Lagrange function number of samples dimension of bearing capacity factor cone factor (de Ruiter and Beringen number of samples (to calculate the coefficient of correlation) perimeter of pile ultimate bearing capacity measured (observed) ultimate capacity average measured (observed) ultimate capacity predicted ultimate capacity 50% cumulative probability unit tip resistance of pile (de Ruiter and Beringen cone tip resistance in the CPT average cone tip resistance the equivalent cone tip resistance at the level of the pile tip (Bustamante and Gianeselli minimum average cone resistance in Schmertmann average cone tip resistance along first, second and third segment of the embedded length of the pile average cone tip resistance below the pile tip number of data in sensitivity analysis coefficient of correlation rank index ultimate shaft resistance ultimate tip resistance undrained shear strength weight vector optimum weight vector input vector support vectors output model output mean of the model output Lagrange multiplier adhesion factor (de Ruiter and Beringen a coefficient for calculating the unit tip resistance in the Bustamante and Gianeselli ratio of pile shaft resistance to the sleeve friction from the CPT for clay (Schmertmann ratio of pile shaft resistance to the sleeve friction from the CPT for sand (Schmertmann width of the RBF kernel width of Pearson VII kernel function standard deviation of the measured output standard deviation of the modeled output tailing factor of the peak in Pearson VII kernel function dot product operator Euclidian norm of weight vector allowable error in the loss function slack variables Ultimate strength prediction is a fundamental aspect of pile foundation design and there exists numerous methods for its determination. Many of the available experimental or theoretical methods for predicting pile capacity incorporate assumptions associated with the parameters that control the ultimate strength or bearing capacity and consequently simplify the problem Recently, machine learning and data mining methods, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), have been applied to many geotechnical engineering problems and have demonstrated a considerable degree of success In addition, prediction of the friction capacity of axially loaded piles In this paper, the SVM is used to predict the ultimate capacity of axially loaded piles, based on cone penetration test (CPT) data. The CPT is a popular in situ test in geotechnical practice which, like other in situ tests, eliminates the uncertainty associated with the laboratory tests, such as sample disturbance, sample preparation and reapplying the in situ conditions in the laboratory, as well as the possible errors due to performing laboratory tests. The strength parameters of soil, which are measured through the CPT, namely cone tip resistance, The support vector machine was introduced in the 1990s based on Vapnik’s statistical learning theory Briefly, SVM estimates the regression by using a set of linear functions, although, it can be developed using non-linear regression A loss function with an The goal is to identify a function that has the greatest The function in Eq. Samples which have a non-zero Lagrange multiplier are known as support vectors It should be emphasized that, since the latest optimization problem can be solved utilizing quadratic programming (QP) techniques, achieving a global minimum (or maximum) is ensured negates any concern regarding local minima In order to develop a SVM model the constants As mentioned previously, the value assigned to Finally, non-linear regression within a SVM can be achieved by mapping the training patterns into a higher dimensional feature space (where the linear regression is feasible) and then applying the linear regression algorithm in that feature space. This process poses computational difficulties due to high dimensionality of the feature space In this study a set of 108 samples is used to develop SVM models for predicting the ultimate capacity of single, axially-loaded piles. Each sample contains information regarding pile geometry, full-scale static pile load test and cone penetration test (CPT) results. The data were obtained from the literature containing pile load tests and the references used to compile the database are given in All piles were subjected to compression static load tests and the ultimate capacity was calculated based on the results of these load tests. The pile fails when rapid pile movement occurs with respect to a constant value of applied load or small increase in it, and the load corresponding to the failure load is considered the ultimate capacity The process of developing the SVM models has been divided into a series of steps, as outlined in the following sections. In order to obtain accurate prediction of pile behavior (including settlement and capacity), an understanding of the factors affecting pile behavior is required In this work, the results of CPTs are considered as quantifying the soil properties. The CPT results consist of cone tip resistance ( In order to develop an SVM model, the data set must be divided into two subsets: training and testing This paper considers SVM as an interpolation technique within the range of the training data. Consequently, all patterns that are contained in the training data need to be included in the testing set. In addition, the ANN literature suggests that the data subsets which are used for developing a model, need to exhibit similar statistical properties (e.g. mean, standard deviation and range) After dividing the available data into their subsets, the variables are pre-processed by scaling them to a suitable form. Scaling eliminates the variables’ dimension As mentioned previously, in order to develop a non-linear SVM model, kernel functions are employed. In this paper, three models with three kernel functions are developed. The radial basis function (RBF), the Pearson VII function and the polynomial function kernels are used in this study, which are shown in Eqs. Once model training has been accomplished successfully, the performance of the trained model is then evaluated against data that have not been used in the learning process (i.e. testing set). Statistical criteria, namely the coefficient of correlation and root mean squared error (RMSE), are used to evaluate the prediction performance of SVM models. The coefficient of correlation ( The stages involved in the process of developing a SVM model, described in the preceding sections, are briefly summarized in a flow chart in In this study three SVM models have been developed. The first model ( The results of SVM models are summarized in It can be seen that among the The results of the optimal model corresponding to each type of kernel function are shown in In order to identify the relative significance of each input variable with respect to ultimate pile load capacity prediction, a simple method proposed by Liong et al. In this paper, a constant rate of 20% It can be seen that the soil properties in the form of CPT measurements, with a combined impact factor of 56.2% (which is sum of three last rows in This section presents the results of a comparison between predictions obtained from the SVM models and three traditional, CPT-based methods for determining pile capacity. The methods proposed by Schmertmann Ultimate shaft resistance ( Ultimate shaft resistance in cohesive soils: Ultimate tip resistance ( Unit shaft resistance ( Unit shaft resistance in clay: Unit tip resistance ( The calculation of the ultimate pile tip capacity in this method is similar to the Schmertmann Ultimate unit shaft resistance: Ultimate unit tip resistance: The same testing data set was applied to these models as were presented to the SVM models, although three samples were not included because of a lack of relevant information. In this work, an approach used by Briaud and Tucker The equation of the best fit line of estimated ( The arithmetic mean and standard deviation of The 50% cumulative probability ( The coefficient of efficiency ( The corresponding method is more efficient when the tangent of the best fit line and Finally, the coefficient of efficiency, In order to quantify the overall performance of the developed models and each traditional, CPT-based method, an overall rank index ( The best fit line of As shown in The plots of Finally, based on the final two columns of The support vector machine (SVM) technique was used to predict the ultimate load carrying capacity of single, axially loaded piles. Three SVM models with three kernel functions, namely radial basis (RBF), Pearson VII and polynomial functions have been developed and among these models the ones with Pearson VII and RBF kernel demonstrate superior performance. The results indicate that the model with Pearson VII kernel has the ability to predict the ultimate bearing capacity with a high degree of accuracy (
