The Purpose of this work is to study about the microstructures, mechanical properties and wear characteristics of as cast silicon carbide (SiC) reinforced aluminum matrix composites (AMCs). AMCs of varying SiC content (0, 5, 10 and 20wt. %) were prepared by stir casting process. Microstructures, Vickers hardness, tensile strength and wear performance of the prepared composites were analyzed. The results showed that introducing SiC reinforcements in aluminum (Al) matrix increased hardness and tensile strength and 20wt. % SiC reinforced AMC showed maximum hardness and tensile strength. Microstructural observation revealed clustering and non-homogeneous distribution of SiC particles in the Al matrix. Porosities were observed in microstructures and increased with increasing wt. % of SiC reinforcements in AMCs. Pin-on-disc wear test indicated that reinforcing Al matrix with SiC particles increased wear resistance.
