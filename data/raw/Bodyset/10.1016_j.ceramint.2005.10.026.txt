Wetting of SiC by molten E2O3(ss)/AlN as a function of temperature up to 2000°C was investigated under argon and nitrogen atmospheres. E2O3(ss) is a solid solution of rare earth oxides produced from xenotime by hydrometallurgy. Wetting was evaluated from contact angle measurements using the sessile drop method. Contact angle was around zero under argon atmosphere, but could not be measured under nitrogen atmosphere, due to bubble formation. The interfaces between molten E2O3(ss)/AlN and SiC were analysed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).Silicon carbide (SiC) ceramics can be produced by liquid phase sintering, which allows obtaining a microstructure suitable for structural applications Metal oxides and aluminium nitride (AlN) mixes are used to produce the liquid phase during liquid phase sintering. The most common mixes are AlN/Y Wettability, one of the most important properties in liquid phase sintering, can be measured by contact angle ( Wettability studies of ceramic systems using Y The aim of this work was to evaluate E Aluminium nitride, AlN (Hermann C. Starck, GRADE C (fine) – Germany), and E The melting temperatures were measured for E Mixes were prepared in an attrition mill for 1 In each wettability experiment, the spheres were placed on a 98.9% dense SiC plate (10.0 After cooling, the samples were cut perpendicularly to the interface and the microstructure were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Phases were formed at high temperatures were analysed by X-ray diffraction (XRD).  As can be observed, the liquid NE3 did not spread uniformly on the SiC plates under nitrogen atmosphere, because bubbles formed during the test, The behaviour of the E  From the fitted curves shown in As a function of temperature, the contact angles of NE2 and NE3 mixes exhibited an exponential decay quite different from the decay observed for NE1 mix (  The experiments revealed that the wettability of E The authors are thankful to Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP) (Grants 01/10664-6 and 01/11339-1), Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) and Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) for financial support.
