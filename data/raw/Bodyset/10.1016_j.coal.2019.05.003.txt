In this paper, we report the CO2, CH4 and N2 sorption isotherms of four dry South African bituminous coals at pressures up to 16 MPa at 55 °C. The sorption capacities of the samples with respect to the adsorbate gases decreased in the order: CO2 > CH4 ≈ N2 by weight, and CO2 > CH4 > N2 by volume. A new model, based on a hybrid Dubinin-Radushkevich and Henry law approach (DR-HH) provided substantially better fits to the sorption isotherm data than the previously used modified DR (M-DR) model. Obtained uncertainty metrics show that the DR-HH model generally returned lower error sum of squares (ESS) and root mean square (RMS) residuals, and higher quality of fit (QOF) compared to the M-DR model.

                     , of the samples for the three adsorbate gases were generally low (8.5–12.8 kJ/mol), but comparable to previous determinations of other coals, indicating that physisorption was the dominating sorption mechanism. The sorption capacities of the samples were found to be rank-dependent as they decreased with increasing vitrinite reflectance and elemental carbon content. The micropore properties of the samples as measured by both CO2 low-pressure gas adsorption (LPGA) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), impacted the sorption properties of the sample more than both the mesopore and macropore properties determined from N2 LPGA, SAXS, and mercury intrusion porosimetry. The sorption capacities of the samples were found to increase with increasing lithotypes abundance, suggesting that lithotype bandings enhances either the fluid transport processes or the micropore properties of the coal matrix. In addition, it has been demonstrated that critical properties of the adsorbate gases influenced their sorption properties.Increasing anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions emanating from the utilisation of fossil fuels for energy production and other industrial processes (cement production, metallurgical uses, etc.), has been largely blamed for global climate change ( South Africa operates a highly energy-intensive economy, with considerable dependency on fossil fuels to meet its energy needs. This, together with a relatively small population, means that South Africa is a significant contributor with respect to per capita emissions of CO Carbon capture and sequestration or storage (CCS) has been demonstrated as a viable and strategic option for climate change mitigation ( However, fundamental knowledge of the sorption properties of these coals to various adsorbate gases, especially CO It has been demonstrated experimentally and by numerical modelling (using a slit-shaped pore and bidisperse model) that selective transport of CO Reported maximum sorption capacities of dry coals of various ranks up to anthracite by weight vary in the range: 20.7–1514 kg/t, db for CO In this paper, we report the CO Four run-of-mine South African bituminous coal samples were used in this study. These samples were collected from underground coal seams within the Highveld, Witbank, and Tshipise-Pafuri coalfields ( The chemical properties of the sample of the coal samples were examined by proximate, ultimate (CHNS) and total sulphur content analyses which were conducted at the Bureau Veritas laboratory, Pretoria, following standard procedures given in The petrographic properties of the coals were studied using standard petrographic analysis methods at the laboratory of Petrographics SA, Pretoria. Sample blocks set in epoxy resin were prepared according to SANS The physical structural properties of the samples encompassing the surface area, porosity, average pore diameters were determined using different techniques including: CO The high-pressure sorption experiments were conducted on a high-pressure gravimetric sorption system (HPGSS) at CSIRO Energy, North Ryde, Australia. The sorption equipment and the analysis procedure has been described in detail elsewhere ( For the adsorption experiments, step-wise pressure increments from about 0.1 MPa up to 16 MPa were used. All the experiments were conducted at 55 °C, and both the ambient temperature and the temperature inside the HPGSS were monitored by thermocouples. All four samples were analysed simultaneously as the HPGSS can hold up to four high pressure stainless steel sample cells at a time. Each sample was exposed to the adsorbate gas in this sequence: CO The resulting data (time, instantaneous mass (mass gain), pressure, and temperature) were acquired via a data logging hardware and software connected to the facility. At each pressure step, the sample was allowed to equilibrate for about 24 h; and data were logged from the HPGSS every 2 h. Sorption equilibrium is deemed to have been reached at each pressure step by continuous record of constant mass of the sample cell over long period, usually >12 h (see The maximum sorption capacities of the samples with respect to the examined adsorbates at 55 °C up to 16 MPa pressure were evaluated using the modified Dubinin-Radushkevich (M-DR) isotherm model (Eq. The affinity constant, In the classical DR equation (Eq. To further account for observations ( The DR-HH isotherm equation has been applied in the study of sorption properties of different adsorptive gases in coal at both sub- and super-critical conditions using volumetric (  Detailed petrographic data of the samples reported on mineral matter basis (vol%, mmb) are presented in Coal microlithotype analysis results (  The results of the N Results from the SAXS analysis ( The skeletal density of the samples ranged from 1495 to 1668 kg/m The raw data from the HPGSS for CO It can be seen from Generally, the easier a gas molecule is to polarise, the stronger the interaction with the adsorbent surface, as well as neighbouring adsorptive molecules (  Two gravimetric sorption models – the M-DR and DR-HH models – were also tested for their ability to fit the experimental excess sorption isotherms of the samples as shown in 3D rendering in From The affinity constants determined for the four coals with respect to the three gases generally increased in the order: CO The net heats of sorption, From the DR-HH model, the proportionality constants,  In Most of the petrographic properties of the coal samples, especially maceral abundance and compositions, yielded a wide scatter without any systematic trend ( It is well known that coal pore and porosity properties significantly impact its utilisation processes including the use of deep-seated and economically unprofitable coal seams as a geological carbon sink as a global climate change mitigation option ( This work investigates the sorption properties of four South African bituminous dry coals from laboratory-scale experiments and further correlated some of the coal properties with the sorption characteristics of the samples. The findings from this study has shown that a benchmark extensive characterisation of the micropore properties of coal seams can give significant insight into the CO The high-pressure CO The studied coal samples can store up to: 4.1–8.7%CO The DR-HH model was found to describe the sorption processes better than the modified Dubinin-Radushkevich (M-DR) model. This shows that the difference in extent of penetration of different gases into coals must be explicitly included in the modelling of sorption. The net heats of sorption of the samples were generally in the range: CO The proportionality constants, For all three adsorptive gases, the maximum sorption capacities of the four investigated samples decreased with increasing vitrinite reflectance (rank) and elemental carbon content. The microlithotype (intermediate macerals) abundance of the samples was also found to impact on the sorption capacity of the samples. The micropore properties of the coal samples were found to significantly influence the sorption processes of the adsorptive more than the mesopore and macropore properties. This supports previous observation that the micropores are the primary fluid storage locations in coals.
