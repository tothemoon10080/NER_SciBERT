The performance of sodium carbonate–sodium sulfite (Na2CO3–Na2SO3) pretreatment on improving the enzymatic hydrolysis of rice straw was investigated. The results indicated that both Na2CO3 and Na2SO3 pretreatments are effective in improving the enzymatic digestibility of rice straw. A higher ratio of Na2SO3 in pretreatment liquor performed better at softening the rice straw through degradation of hemicellulose, delignification, and lignin sulfonation, while it was conserving more polysaccharides during the pretreatment than Na2CO3. The highest sugar recovery of pretreated rice straw, 74.5%, 82.7%, and 59.5% for total sugar, glucan, and xylan, respectively, was obtained at cellulase loading of 20FPU/g-cellulose after the pretreatment at 140°C, chemical charge of 12%, Na2CO3–Na2SO3 ratio of 0:1 (i.e., only Na2SO3 pretreatment). The corresponding delignification ratio of pretreated solid was 53.4%, and 91.4% of the polysaccharides were conserved. The sugar recovery of only Na2CO3 pretreatment at the ratio of 1:0 was 67.1%, 74.4%, and 53.7% for total sugar, glucan, and xylan, respectively, at 140°C, chemical charge of 12%, and enzyme loading of 20FPU/g-cellulose. Its corresponding delignification ratio was 40.3%, and polysaccharides conservation ratio was 88.9%.The world's energy resources are mainly based on non-renewable and depleting fossil fuels, which results in an increasing worldwide interest in exploring alternative and renewable fuels out of long-term economic, environmental and national security concerns ( A promising pretreatment, which decreases the most cost in the biological conversion, should be seriously developed to support the subsequent hydrolysis and fermentation steps ( Green liquor (mainly composed of sodium carbonate and sodium sulfide) used as a pretreatment of kraft pulping or biomass conversion showed enhanced pulp qualities and promising enzymatic digestibility ( Traditional sulfite pulping has been practiced in industry for more than a century, but it has gradually been replaced by kraft pulping for papermaking. The sulfite pulping can degrade a considerable amount of hemicellulose, reduce the degrees of polymerization of cellulose and xylan, and increase the hydrophilicity of lignin by sulfonation ( China is the largest agricultural country in the world, and produces huge quantities of agricultural residues every year. Of these under-utilized and environmental polluting residues, rice straw can be considered as a novel feedstock for bioethanol production. It contains significant amount of cellulose and hemicellulose, as well as soft carbohydrates (SCs), which are defined as readily recoverable carbohydrates via direct extraction or enzymatic hydrolysis ( Rice straw was provided by a papermaking plant in Jiangsu, China. Air dried raw materials without classification were cut to 3–5 The enzymes used for the enzymatic hydrolysis in this study were NS 50013 (cellulase, enzyme activity 84 The pretreatment was carried out in an electrically heated oil bath containing 10 bombs of 1 A laboratory KRK refiner ( Lignin and carbohydrates contents of raw and pretreated materials were analyzed using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) procedure ( Filter paper activity of cellulase was determined following the standard method recommended by the Commission Biotechnology, IUPAC ( The reduction of lignin, solubilization of glucan and xylan will happen during the pretreatment process. The pretreated solid yield (based on od materials) and spent liquor pH of rice straw pretreated with different ratio of Na The solid yield of rice straw pretreated with Na It is well known that lignin encases the cellulose in the cell walls, and that is also responsible for the useless adsorption of cellulases, and therefore, it limits the rate and extent of enzymatic hydrolysis of lingocelluloses ( When the chemical charge was 0% (auto-hydrolysis), about 10% of the lignin was removed. The increasing chemical charge led to enhanced delignification, and the Na The pretreated materials are then subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis to produce monomeric sugars, so the loss of polysaccharides should be minimized as long as the degrees of polymerization of cellulose and xylan are reduced to the proper extent during the pretreatment process ( As shown in The yield of pretreated solid, the contents of polysaccharides, lignin and ash (based on the od weight of original materials) in rice straw pretreated with different molar ratio of Na Enzymatic hydrolysis was carried out to investigate the effect of lignin and hemicellulose removal on sugar conversion and to compare the digestibility of Na As shown in The glucan and xylan recovery of pretreated rice straw, as illustrated in The relationship between the delignification ratio of Na Both Na The authors are grateful for the financial support of
