This work describes preparation and application of “homemade” chloride ISE enriched with iron oxides or zinc oxide nanoparticles. The prepared chloride ISE membrane was made of AgCl:Ag2S:PTFE = 1:1:2 and AgCl:Ag2S:PTFE = 2:1:2 enriched with mentioned nanoparticles in ratio 0.5-1.2 wt.%. Prepared membranes were used for chloride determination in perchloric acid (pH = 0-2) and acetic buffer (pH = 4 - 4.75). Due to the low method price, simplicity and a reasonably fast way of usage, it was considered as a possibility for chloride determination in high acid media. Two of prepared membranes (M1 and M4) have shown best characteristics. M1 showed linear response range for chloride between 2.0x10-6 and 1*10-1 mol L-1, with a detection limit of 2.24*10-6 mol L-1 and potential change of 44.39 mV per decade. M4 showed linear response range for chloride between 4.2*10-6 to 1*10-1 mol L-1, limit of detection of 1.39*10-6 mol L-1 with potential change of 24.79 mV per decade at pH = 0.
