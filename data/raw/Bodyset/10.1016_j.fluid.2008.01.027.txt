A recently developed mixed-solvent electrolyte (MSE) model to describe the chemistry of calcium sulphate in aqueous multi-component sulphate solutions has been extended to complex mixed chloride–sulphate solutions. The model accurately represents the solubility of calcium sulphate solid phases, namely dihydrate, hemihydrate and anhydrite, in mixed chloride–sulphate solutions containing H2SO4, Fe2(SO4)3, HCl, NaCl, Na2SO4, MgCl2, MgSO4, CaCl2, etc., over a wide range of temperatures and ionic strengths. It predicted the solubility of calcium sulphate from 20 to 95°C in simulated nickel processing solutions containing NiSO4, H2SO4, Fe2(SO4)3, Na2SO4 and LiCl. It was found that increasing Na2SO4 or LiCl concentrations in NiSO4–H2SO4 solutions do not have a significant effect on the calcium sulphate solubility. The model was shown to be a practical tool for assessing the scaling potential of calcium sulphate over a wide range of temperatures and concentrations where experimental data are not available.The formation of calcium sulphate hydrates (namely, dihydrate (DH: CaSO The purpose of the present work is to develop a chemical model to describe and predict the solubility of calcium sulphate hydrates (DH, HH, and AH) in mixed multi-component sulphate and chloride solutions containing LiCl, NiSO A review of published modeling studies shows that no previous work has been formally undertaken to study the simultaneous effect of various metal sulphate salts, as well as metal chloride salts, on the solubility of the three phases of calcium sulphate in H The speciation modelling approach was used by Adams Recently, Li and Demopoulos In order to expand the applicability of the above work and to develop a comprehensive, self-consistent model which is capable of predicting the solubility of all the CaSO In this work, the OLI default value for the dissociation constant of the bisulphate ion was used. Wang et al. Another feature of the new approach that is used in the present work is the adjustment of the standard state Gibbs free energy and entropy to determine the optimum solubility product values for the solid phases. Although these solubility product adjustments are usually very small in comparison with the established values, the improvement gained in fitting experimental multicomponent systems is remarkable. This procedure ensures that solid–liquid equilibria are correctly reproduced over wide temperature ranges together with other properties that are influenced by liquid-phase parameters such as vapour–liquid equilibria, pH or heat of dilution In this work, all available experimental data for the entire temperature and concentration range were used in the parameterization steps and the predictability of the new model was examined for the temperature range from 25 to 250 The solubility of calcium sulphate hydrates is equal to the sum of the molalities of the free calcium ion Ca By re-arranging Eqs. The solubility of calcium sulphate hydrates is equal to the sum of the molalities of the free calcium ion Ca By substituting To calculate the solubility of calcium sulphate hydrates, the solubility product ( The new model developed in this work is based on the recently developed model The application of the MSE model within the OLI software platform for hydrometallurgical processing solutions has already proven its efficiency and accuracy in predicting the properties of multicomponent solutions The MSE model was established by combining an excess Gibbs energy model for mixed-solvent electrolyte systems with a comprehensive treatment of chemical equilibria. In this framework, the excess Gibbs energy is expressed as The regression parameters in the MSE model are those of the UNIQUAC and the middle-range parameters. The UNIQUAC parameters are primarily for non-electrolyte species and the middle-range parameters are primarily for ion–ion and ion–molecule species. In this work, ions are the dominant species in the systems of interest, and as a result, MR interactions between dominant ions or between ions and molecules have been considered. The validation of the model and the evaluation of the model parameters require a large amount of experimental data of various types, such as activity coefficients in completely dissociated aqueous systems, the activity of water, the solubility of salts in water or in mixed solvent solutions and heat capacities. Model parameters are determined by the simultaneous inclusion of all the available experimental data in a data regression run, and minimization of the differences between the experimental and calculated properties. The validation of the model parameters is made by comparing the model results with experimental data obtained beyond the range of the available data used to determine the parameters. Because the model developed in this work is an extension of a previous model The solubility of calcium chloride in water and of calcium sulphate hydrates in mixed chloride–sulphate systems (shown in The OLI default MSE database was tested using the mean activity coefficient ( The ability of the OLI default database to predict the solubility of CaSO The solubility of CaSO The CaSO Similarly, the solubility of CaSO Cameron and Seidell In the previously developed model Therefore, the available experimental data for the systems mentioned above and for a new set of experimental data on the solubility of CaSO In the initial part of this paper, it was shown that the MSE activity model is effective for fitting the solubility trends of all three solid phases of CaSO Dutrizac and Kuiper In this system, gypsum was consistently the saturating solid phase in the experiments carried out using acid concentrations less than 0.2 In nickel pressure leaching processes, the associated iron is dissolved in the autoclave along with the nickel. Although most of the dissolved iron reprecipitates in the autoclave as ferric oxide, ferric oxyhydroxide or jarosite, some remains in the discharged solution. This dissolved iron is subsequently oxidized and precipitated when the solution is neutralized with lime. Thus, various iron concentrations will be encountered in different parts of the process, and for this reason, the effect of the concentration of ferric sulphate on the solubility of calcium sulphate is important. The solubility of CaSO The addition of chloride ions to a sulphate processing solution could significantly affect the solubility of calcium sulphate, in a non-predictable manner. To ascertain the influence of chloride concentration on the solubility of calcium sulphate, a systematic series of solubility measurements was carried out by Dutrizac and Kuiper The experimental solubility data for this system are shown in In nickel hydrometallurgy, sodium carbonate is sometimes used, directly or indirectly, for pH control. This practice results in the presence of sodium ions in the circulating sulphate–chloride processing solutions. The sodium ions can be considered to be present, formally, as either Na The experimental data and the model predictions are shown in The solubility of CaSO Even at high concentrations of CaCl Various experiments were carried out by Li and Demopoulos to investigate the effect of magnesium chloride concentration on the solubility of calcium sulphate dihydrate (gypsum) and anhydrite at constant concentrations of hydrochloric acid, over the temperature range from 25 to 80 The experimental solubility data for this system at 3 The solubility of calcium sulphate dihydrate as a function of the CaCl  The solubility of calcium sulphate dihydrate (gypsum) and anhydrite in mixed CaCl Despite the complex solubility trends determined, the new model is able to predict these experimental data fairly closely as is shown in The solubility of calcium sulphate dihydrate (gypsum) and anhydrite in quaternary aqueous solutions of CaSO The solubility of gypsum in aqueous solutions of CaSO It is clear from the figure that the solubility of calcium sulphate initially decreases with increasing Na The solubility of calcium sulphate dihydrate and anhydrite in aqueous solutions of CaSO The solubility of gypsum in multicomponent aqueous solutions of NaCl, MgCl The solubility of calcium sulphate dihydrate in aqueous solutions containing FeCl Then, obtained parameters were employed to predict gypsum solubility in aqueous solutions containing FeCl A recently developed mixed-solvent electrolyte model to describe the chemistry of calcium sulphate in aqueous multicomponent sulphate solutions has been extended such that it can be successfully applied to complex multicomponent chloride–sulphate solutions. In order to improve the predictability and self-consistency of the new model, interaction parameters were obtained by fitting the experimentally obtained data for binary and ternary systems, and the interaction parameters were subsequently validated in multicomponent systems. This approach is superior to that presented in other studies where interaction parameters were adjusted using only multicomponent solutions, because the latter approach does not guarantee consistent and accurate results in binary, ternary and other multicomponent systems. Another important feature of the new model is the adjustment of the standard state Gibbs free energy and entropy to obtain the optimum solubility product values for the solid phases. This approach allows a better extrapolation of the equilibrium constants to higher temperatures, compared to fitting the empirical parameters in the solubility product equation.
