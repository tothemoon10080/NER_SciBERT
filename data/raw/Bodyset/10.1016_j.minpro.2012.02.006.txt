The distribution performance of a flotation bank, consisting of a number of cells in a series is determined for different purposes such as process design, scale up, diagnosis, operation and control, and optimization. Traditionally in plant operation mass balances around the whole flotation bank is developed in order to characterize the overall recovery typically in rougher flotation. However, carrying out experiments to fit flotation rate models are seldom undertaken on industrial flotation banks due to laborious sampling, preparation and analysis. In this work, in order to investigate the effect of particle size distribution of the feed of rougher cells on metallurgical characteristics at Sungun copper plant, the kinetics of different size fractions through rougher bank was studied by using both traditional and Yianatos methods. The Yianatos method depends on collecting samples from only five locations. It is indicated that the Yianatos method can be beneficial in kinetic rate constant determination for the whole size range and the results were compared with the traditional method.The efficiency of flotation depends on the characteristics of solid particles including mineralogy and particle size; the type of instrumentation; and operation of the controlled variables such as air flow rate, pulp level and reagent dosage ( The distribution performance of a flotation bank can be correctly determined by the tanks-in-series model ( The simplest The flotation activity of an ore decreases gradually as the range of particle size becomes finer because of the increase in the number of particles per weight unit, the deteriorating conditions for bubble-particle contact, and the effects such as the increased surface oxidation of the particles. A sudden decrease in flotation activity above the optimum particle size is due to either lesser degrees of liberation of the minerals or the decreasing ability of the bubbles to lift the coarser particles ( The effect of stage addition of collector on flotation performance is shown in Yianatos proposed a short-cut method for kinetic rate modeling which depended only on the first cell of the bank together with sampling the flotation bank as a whole. Thus, samples were only collected from 5 streams: feed, concentrate and tailings of the first cell, final concentrate, and final tailings. Then, two mass balances are adjusted, one around the first cell and the other around the whole flotation bank ( Representative samples were collected from the feed, concentrates and tailings of the rougher cells at the Sungun copper plant. For flotation rate modeling using the traditional method, pulp streams 1 to 14 were sampled while in the Yianatos short-cut method, 5 samples were taken whose location are marked by an asterisk in The concentrate of each unit composed of the concentrates of the two cells of that unit, based on an assumption that the mass flow rates of the two adjacent cells in a unit are equal. The tailings of the units were sampled with a lag time of 5 The traditional and Yianatos methods were used to determine flotation rate constant for Sungun rougher flotation bank, using the kinetic model presented in The results of the recovery and the concentrate grade of the cells are shown in The cumulative recovery of the cells for different size fractions is shown in Fine and medium size particles (liberated particles) as a result of a having higher rate constant in comparison with the coarse particles are recovered from the first cells of the bank after the early stages of collector addition ( The results of fitting the kinetic model to plant data using the traditional and Yianatos (Short-cut) methods for different size fractions and for the whole size range (Cu bulk) are shown in The kinetic rate constants of different size fractions, calculated by fitting the kinetic model on the data taken from the plant, are shown in Results confirm that the short-cut method (minimum sampling and analysis effort) is a good approach to describe industrial flotation operations provided the process has a normal behavior. First, the recovery of the cells 7 to 10 of the rougher flotation bank was very low. Furthermore, for the size fractions coarser than 75 This work was supported by the
