Two anion exchange resins – strongly basic Amberlyst A 29 and weakly basic Amberlyst A 21 – were applied to the adsorption of palladium(II) complexes from HCl-NaCl solutions over a range of acid concentrations (0.1–2.0 M) in 1.0 and 2.0 M NaCl using static and dynamic methods. The breakthrough curves of Pd(II) were used to calculate the ion exchange capacity, weight and bed distribution coefficients. Kinetic studies applied the Legergren's equation, the pseudo-second order and the inter-particle diffusion kinetic models to calculate kinetic parameters. It was observed that Amberlyst A 21 is more promising for adsorbing palladium(II) chloro-complexes from acidic chloride solutions than Amberlyst A 29. Furthermore, the type 1, pseudo-second order linear kinetic model has the highest correlation coefficient and gives the best fit between the experimental and predicted data.Like platinum and gold, palladium is one of the precious and expensive metals. Palladium is characterized by some unique physical and chemical properties that are applied in industry as catalysts and corrosion resistant materials or as possible applications in anti-tumor drug production. Furthermore, alloys with gold, platinum and silver are used in jewellery and in other fields ( Ion exchange has become a valuable and sometimes irreplaceable method of metal ion separation, purification and recovery from waste materials in chemical technology. Strong and weakly basic anionic exchangers were widely applied in sorption and recovery of palladium(II) complexes from scrap materials ( The aim of this paper is to study the applicability of strongly basic Amberlyst A 29 and weakly basic Amberlyst A 21 anion exchangers for the adsorption of palladium(II) complexes from 1.0 M and 2.0 M NaCl solutions containing 0.1 An aqueous stock solution was prepared from A.R.Grade, > Amberlyst A 21 (Rohm & Haas Co., France) is a weakly basic anionic exchanger with the dimethylamine group (—N(CH Amberlyst A 29 (Rohm and Haas Co., USA) is a strongly basic anionic exchanger, type 2 with a dimethyl-hydroxyethyl- quaternary amine group (—N The adsorption of palladium(II) complexes was carried out by means of static and dynamic methods. The dynamic method was applied in order to determine the breakthrough curves of Pd(II) complexes and then the breakthrough curves were used to calculate the values of the working ion exchange capacity (C In order to calculate the weight (D The static method was used in kinetics studies of palladium(II) adsorption as well as for the determination of the amount of palladium(II) complexes adsorbed onto anion exchangers (q The palladium(II) concentration in an eluate was determined by the spectrophotometric iodide method using a spectrophotometer Specord M 42 (Carl Zeiss Jena, Germany). The working parameters of the spectrophotometer were as follows: wavelength, 407 nm; slit width, 1 mm; determination range, 0.2–10 µg/cm The iodide method is based on the derivatization reaction with potassium iodide (KI). Palladium(II) anion in the presence of excess KI forms the red-brown complex [PdI Amberlyst A 29 and Amberlyst A 21 were dried at room temperature and then 0.5 g were shaken in a conical flask with 50 cm The pseudo-first and the pseudo-second order kinetics equations and the inter-particle diffusion model were used in the kinetics study. The pseudo-first order Legergren rate expression is generally decribed using the following equation: In order to confirm the applicability of the pseudo-first order kinetics model, a plot log(q The equilibrium sorption capacity must be known, but in many cases q The sorption data was also analysed in terms of the pseudo-second order mechanism and is given by: The constant k The pseudo-second order kinetics equation can be rearranged to at least four different types I–IV ( type I type II type III type IV The inter-particle diffusion model presented below refers to the theory proposed by Weber and Morris who concluded that uptake is proportional to the square root of the contact time during the course sorption. The initial rate of the inter-particle diffusion is as follows: The rate parameter (k Palladium(II) adsorption onto anion exchangers was carried out by means of the dynamic method to determine the breakthrough curves of Pd(II). The comparison between the breakthrough curves for the two anion exchangers studied is presented in The difference between the resin parameters values is caused by different types or functional groups of the resin, different solution compositions and possibly different mechanism of Pd(II) complexes binding.. Amberlyst A 21 posseses the dimethylamine group (—N(CH Amberlyst A 29 possesses substituent functional groups that contain an additional oxygen donor atom. In the presence of N and O donor atoms, the chelating mechanism may occur: In chloride solutions, palladium(II) can form a variety of mostly anionic chloride (PdCl Thus, in the solutions containing > The amount of palladium(II) complexes adsorbed onto anion exchangers (q Due to the fact that chemical kinetics of ion exchange is satisfactorily explained by the pseudo-second order reaction, the authors concentrated only on this model (and their different types) and on inter-particle diffusion. Owing to the high number of kinetic plots, only plots for the adsorption palladium(II) onto Amberlite A 21 are presented from solutions 0.1 The kinetics of palladium(II) complexes adsorption was analyzed using the pseudo-second order kinetic models, types I, II, III and IV. The applicability of the model is confirmed if a plot of t/q The inter-particle diffusion model cannot be applied to explain the adsorption process as evidenced from the parameters for this model (  The anionic exchangers: Amberlyst A 29 and Amberlyst A 21 are very effective for the adsorption of palladium(II) complexes from acidic chloride solutions. Amberlyst A 21 is slightly more effective than Amberlyst A 29 for the pre-concentration of trace amounts of PGM metals and their recovery from scrap materials are possible.
