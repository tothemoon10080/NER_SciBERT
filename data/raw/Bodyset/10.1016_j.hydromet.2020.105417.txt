The catalytic mechanism of activated carbon-assisted bioleaching of enargite concentrate (enargite 37.4%; pyrite 47.3%) was investigated by employing microbiological, electrochemical and kinetic studies. By using moderately thermophilic microorganisms at 45 °C, the final Cu dissolution was improved from 36% to 53% at 0.2% (w/v) activated carbon. An excess activated carbon addition showed an adverse effect. The enargite mineral itself favored higher solution redox potential (E
                     h) for solubilization. However, the dissolution of co-existing pyrite, which also favors high E
                     h, immediately hindered enargite dissolution through the passivation effect. The surface of activated carbon functioned as an electron mediator to couple RISCs oxidation and Fe3+ reduction, so that elevation of the E
                     h level was controlled by offsetting microbial Fe3+ regeneration. As long as the E
                     h level was suppressed at <700 mV, the dissolution of pyrite was largely avoided, enabling a steady and continuous dissolution of the enargite mineral through the surface chemical reaction model. When the E
                     h-control by activated carbon becomes no longer sustainable and the E
                     h hits 700 mV, rapid pyrite dissolution was initiated and the surface chemical reaction of enargite dissolution came to an end. Arsenic species dissolved from enargite was constantly immobilized with an efficiency of 75–90% as amorphous ferric arsenate. However, the sudden initiation of pyrite dissolution also triggered the re-solubilization of ferric arsenate. Therefore, the sustainable E
                     h-controlling effect was shown to be critical to enable longer Cu dissolution from enargite as well as stabilization of As precipitates.Enargite (Cu High-temperature bioleaching (65–70 °C) was generally shown to be effective in several studies, achieving the final Cu dissolution ranging 52–91% ( The utility of the Ag catalyst has been recognized in the case of an another refractory primary copper sulfide mineral, chalcopyrite (CuFeS More recently, the catalytic effect of Ag was also confirmed with enargite in an electrochemical study, where the presence of Ag was suggested to promote the transformation of enargite into more amenable intermediate, chalcocite (Cu To alternate the expensive Ag catalyst, the effect of carbon has been also a focus of bioleaching as well as (electro)chemical leaching studies. In the case of chalcopyrite, the effectiveness of activated carbon in bioleaching was reported, where the Galvanic interaction between electrically nobler activated carbon and electrically poorer chalcopyrite, as well as the lowered As for the case of enargite,  Nonetheless, the catalytic effect of activated carbon is yet poorly understood in the bioleaching reaction of enargite. The fundamental difference between the two representative primary copper sulfides, chalcopyrite and enargite, is that unlike the case of chalcopyrite leaching which favors the controlled For oxidative dissolution of As-bearing enargite and other sulfide minerals in this study, the following three bacterial strains were chosen: Fe-oxidizing The enargite concentrate (P Granular activated carbon (CAS RN: 7440-44-0; Wako) of the average particle size of 5 mm was used in this study. The BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) specific surface area and average pore diameter of activated carbon were determined to be 1212 m Pre-grown cells of each of the three strains were harvested by centrifugation (9000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C) and washed twice with acidified water (pH 1.7), prior to inoculation into 200 mL HBS medium (pH 2.0; in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks) containing 2% ( Liquid samples were filtered (0.20 μm) to measure concentrations of total Cu, Fe and As by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES; Optima 8300DV; PerkinElmer), and Fe Abiotic tests: Activated carbon (0.1%) was added to 100 mL of acidophile basal salts (ABS) medium (0.5 g/L MgSO In order to investigate the microbial population structure in bioleaching cultures, purification of genomic DNA, PCR-amplification of the 16S rRNA gene (template for real-time PCR), purification of the resultant PCR products and Real-Time PCR (MiniOpticon, Bio-Rad) were conducted according to the methods described by Three mineral electrodes (1 cm The activated carbon-catalyzed bioleaching reactions were evaluated by the shrinking core model. Based on this model, the mineral particle dissolution proceeds via diffusion through liquid film [Eq. X: the fraction of dissolved Cu   Cell-free control cultures: In the absence of activated carbon, the low Bioleaching cultures: In the absence of activated carbon, microbial Fe EPMA elemental mapping of a bioleached enargite concentrate sample in Cell growth at 0.1% activated carbon was mostly equivalent to that without activated carbon. However, increasing the activated carbon dose to 0.2% caused an apparent lag in total cell growth ( In In the presence of Fe When either Fe Progressive Fe The above results indicate that activated carbon naturally possesses both Fe To explain the catalytic mechanism of activated carbon, the involvement of Galvanic interaction between activated carbon and chalcopyrite during bioleaching has been suggested by other researchers ( The overall results obtained here and previous sections suggest the following: Under the conditions where activated carbon displays the catalytic The activated carbon-catalyzed bioleaching reactions ( The results from previous sections revealed that the main catalytic role of activated carbon in enargite bioleaching was Fe Although the enargite mineral itself favors higher The activity of Fe-oxidizing microbes pushes the When activated carbon is present, however, its surface effectively functions as an electron mediator to couple RISCs (especially soluble RISCs) oxidation and Fe Since activated carbon also displays As(III) oxidation activity by coupling with Fe The combination of the above reactions was shown to contribute to the activated carbon-catalyzed bioleaching of enargite concentrate.
