 Copper-based powders are used to make self-lubricating bearings, the application of which in the PM industry dates back to the 1920s and still accounts for the major portion of PM copper and copper alloy applications. Other important uses for copper and copper-base PM materials include friction materials, electrical parts, filters, additives to iron as well as aluminum powder alloying, catalysts, paints and pigments. The copper-based PM products achieved a record 54 100 mt globally in 2000 as is shown in Copper powders above 99% purity are commercially available. The four cardinal techniques of producing copper powders are: atomization, oxide reduction, electrolysis and hydrometallurgy. Of the above methods, atomization and oxide reduction are presently applied on a large global scale. Hydrometallurgical copper powders have not been manufactured in the USA since the early 1980s, but they are produced in Europe and Japan. A large portion of electrolytic powder manufacture is in Russia, where the Uralelectromed Company, located in immediate proximity to Yekaterinburg, annually produces about 6000 tonnes, while its production facility for copper powder is estimated at a total of about 12 000 tonnes per annum. In this process, molten metal flows from a tundish through a refractory nozzle and the liquid stream is disintegrated into droplets by the impact of water or gas jets. The droplets solidify into powder particles. Inert gas atomization produces spherical particles, while the shape of water-atomized powders can be regulated from irregular to nearly spherical by controlling the interaction conditions between the water jet and the metal stream, including liquid flow rate, water pressure and atomizer design. Particle shapes of gas- and water-atomized copper powder are shown in Spherical copper powders have insufficient green strength for use in conventional PM. To give them compressibility, their particle shape and morphology may be transformed by means of mechanical processing and/or oxidation and reduction, as described below in ‘Reduction of copper oxide’.  Details of atomization, including fundamentals and atomizer design, are contained in Generally, the copper is superheated to 100–150°C above the melting point, providing flow rates of nearly 28 kg/min through one nozzle. Ordinarily, to produce powder with particle size mainly less than 150 μm (100 mesh), water pressure must be in the range from 10 to 14 MPa. The conductivity of copper depends very strongly on the impurities. The effect of impurities in solid solution on the electrical conductivity of oxygen-free copper is illustrated in The need for oxygen control at this stage of the process depends on the subsequent processing and end use of the powder. In conventional refining of copper, poling and steam-generated hydrogen keep copper oxidation within the equilibrium curves shown in If the powder is used in the as-atomized state, lower oxygen contents are generally necessary, because of the deleterious effects of oxygen in many In the reduction process, hydrogen readily diffuses through solid copper to react with oxygen and form steam. The large steam molecules, unable to diffuse through solid copper, break their way through grain boundaries, a phenomenon known as hydrogen embrittlement of copper, which reveals itself in the formation of blisters and cracks. These defects improve both compactibility and sintering rate during liquid phase sintering of copper mixed with tin. There are applications of copper powders which require apparent densities lower than those reachable with water atomization. These powders can be produced by addition of negligible quantities, up to 0.2%, of certain elements, such as magnesium, titanium, calcium and lithium, to the copper melt prior to atomization. These metal additions decrease the surface tension of copper and/or form oxide films on the particle surface during atomization. Magnesium additions are usually used to produce compacting grade copper powder such as design parts, filters and additives for iron powders. Such powders may have apparent densities as low as 2 g/cm The addition of small amounts of phosphorus (0.1–0.3 wt%) to the molten copper before atomization, allows the manufacture of a spherical powder very low in oxygen. During atomization, even by means of air, the phosphorus oxidizes and forms protective gaseous phosphorus pentoxide (P Spherical copper powders with controlled particle size are used in applications such as thermal spray coatings, metal impregnated plastics and heat exchangers. Irregular copper powders are used in compacting applications such as bronze mixes for self-lubricating bearings, friction materials, electrical brushes, electrical parts requiring high strength and electrical/thermal conductivity, additions to iron mixes, and diamond cutting wheels. Irregular copper powders are also used in brazing compounds and various chemical applications such as catalysts and in the production of copper compounds. Typical properties of commercial grades of water- and gas-atomized copper powders are given in A flow diagram of the water atomization process for copper and copper alloy powders production is shown in The first stage in the atomization process is the preparation of charge material for melting. Copper cathodes are cut by shears into pieces suitable for charging into the furnace. Charge components are weighed, The procedure is as follows. The copper is charged into the furnace and heated to 1020–1040°C. After melting, the remaining ingredients are added, the melt being covered by a layer of dry charcoal. The melt is then transferred to the holding furnace and the temperature is raised to 1197 ± 10°C and held for 10 minutes. The slag is then removed and the melt ‘poled’ with green wood and sampled for chemical analysis. The melt is superheated to approximately 1230–1280°C (147–197°C over melting point) and then poured into the tundish preheated up to 1100–1150°C, while the melt surface is covered by charcoal; liquid copper flows out through a calibrated pipe in the bottom, forming a melt stream which is atomized by water jets. Thus, a ‘free fall’ water-atomization design is used [ The copper powder pulp in weight ratio of solid to water at approximately 1 to 10 is dewatered in vacuum filters. Powder with water up to 15 wt% is accumulated on the filter surface. Wet powder is dried in a convective dryer in an upward flow of gases such as combustion products of natural gas. Coarse powder particles above commercial powder size fall to the bottom of the container connected to the drier. Part of the commercial powder also falls into this container. This settling powder is then briquetted and in the form of briquettes is returned for remelting. Dried powder is separated in primary and secondary cyclones. The former separates powder fractions approximately coarser than 50 μm, while the latter separates the fine particle fraction. Subsequent separation of coarser fractions into given size ranges is done on a sealed round vibrating screen. Moisture content in dried powder is max 0.5 wt%. To avoid moisture condensation in the duct of the drying unit, the system is preheated for about 15 minutes before setting in operation. Outside surfaces of the drying pipe, cyclones and connecting ducts are thermally insulated. Powders from storage bins in the required ratio (depend on commercial powder size distribution) are blended in double-cone or in a toroidal vibrating mixer. To prevent oxidation, the powder is covered by a passivating addition based on polymeric compounds. The powder is charged into a container ensuring uniform descent of the powder layers in a container cross-section during powder unloading, which prevents its segregation. A container with commercial powder is installed into a unit of proportioning and packing and powder is poured into polyethylene bags of capacity up to 20 kg, vacuum degassed and the bags are sealed. Commercial copper alloy powders, including brasses, bronzes and nickel silver, are manufactured in a similar way. Usually, the same integrated manufacturing facilities are used to complete the melting process, atomization, dewatering, drying, particle size separation and blending of a lot. High purity raw materials are used. To ensure continuity and homogeneity, the molten batch is transferred to a second furnace with a greater holding capacity than the primary melting furnace. Induction heating is preferred for the final melting processing to ensure continuous induced liquid metal movement required for alloy homogeneity, including uniform Atomization is achieved by maintaining a constant flow of molten stream from the secondary furnace and by controlling the pressure of the atomizing medium. Adjustment of powder properties, including particle size distribution, apparent density and green strength of compacts of each alloy is achieved by controlled variation of the atomizing process conditions comprising atomizing medium flow rate, molten metal superheating, atomizer design, etc. Subsequent reduction of oxides is not required for standard PM copper alloy grades. Air-cooled, air-atomized powder is collected and passed over a primary screen to separate oversize particles. Usually, these are remelted during the processing of each alloy. In conclusion, the screened powder may be blended with dry organic lubricants, such as zinc stearate, for use in the manufacture of PM structural components. Powder properties are maintained constant by periodically recording the atomizing parameters and evaluating the properties of representative samples from the in-process atomized product. Brasses include the larger portion of copper-base alloy powders used for PM parts fabrication. Typical copper–zinc brass powders have zinc contents ranging from 10 to 30 wt%. Lead may be added in small amounts, from 1 to 2 %, to improve the machinability of the sintered compacts. The melting temperature is lowered as zinc content increases. Thus, the melting temperatures range from 1045°C for 90Cu–10Zn to 960°C for 70Cu–30Zn. A superheat in excess of the melting point depends on heat losses within the manufacturing system and the physical property requirements of the atomized powders. Typical micrographs of water- and gas-atomized brasses are shown in For typical commercial brass the compressibility at 414 MPa is 7.6 g/cm Ordinary compositions are 90%Cu–10%Sn and 85%Cu–15%Sn, produced by the same technique as brass powder, except that high purity copper and tin are used. As base powders for parts fabrication, the use of prealloyed atomized bronze compositions is hampered because of their nodular particle form and high apparent density, both of which contribute to poor compacted green strength. Typical properties of the bronze alloy compositions are given in Fine bronze powder 80/20 (SF-BR8020) is produced by ultra-high-pressure water atomization. Such powders, manufactured by Nippon Atomised Metal Powders Co., have an irregular shape with mean diameter of 5, 10 and 15 μm for different powder grades. The tap density is 3.6 and 3.8 g/cm Compressibility for typical bronze powder, such as 90/10 composition, is 7.4g/cm Spherical 89/11 and 90/10 bronze powders are used to manufacture filters. These powders are usually made by horizontal air atomizing and dry collection and separation. The spherical shape is attained due to addition of small amounts of phosphorus in the range from 0.2 to 0.45 wt%, which is introduced into the molten bronze in the form of a Cu-15%P alloy prior to atomizing. During air atomization, the oxygen predominantly reacts with phosphorus, forming phosphorus pentoxide, which is volatile at atomizing temperature. As a result, the surface oxidation of the droplets, which would lead to irregular shape on solidification, is avoided. The spherical powders with particle size usually ranging from 45 to 850 μm are screened to produce a number of grades, each with a narrow particle size range. Thus, the commercial spherical bronze powders produced by Makin Metal Powder Ltd include 16 grades varying in size from 45/63 μm to 850/1180 μm. Each grade may contain up to 5% of particles above the upper size limit and up to 10% of particles below the lower size limit. Properties of filter materials produced by loose powder sintering of spherical powders are strongly dependent on the particle size. Characteristically, a sintered filter made from spherical powder with particle size between 180 and 125 μm with filter thickness 1.6 mm has tensile strength of 33–35 MPa, viscous permeability coefficient of 9 × 10 Several compositions, such as 70Cu–30Pb, 84Cu–8Pb–8Sn, and 80Cu–10Pb–10Sn, are manufactured by water atomization. The apparent density is in range from 3.3 to 4.0 g/cm Varied commercial bronze powders for diamond tools are produced by ultra-high-pressure water atomization. These powder grades include: CuSnAl, contains 27–29 wt% Sn, 4.5–5.5 Al; SF–CuAl(80–20), contains 19–21 wt% Al, max 0.1 wt% Sn; SF–CuAg(80–20), contains 20 wt% Ag, max 0.1 wt% Sn; SF–CuNiSn, contains 9–11 wt% Sn, 19–21 wt% Ni; and others. Nickel–silver base alloy compositions, (60–65)Cu–(17–19)Ni–(17–23)Zn, are ordinarily used in the PM industry for sintered parts. These alloys can be modified by the addition of lead to improve machinability. Melting technique is similar to that used for brasses, except the melt temperature is 1093°C for superheat in excess of the melting point. Fine nickel silver powder consisting of 64Cu–18Ni–18Zn is produced by ultra-high-pressure water atomization. Median diameter of this powder is 10 μm. Water-atomized Cu–Ni alloy powders consisting of 74–76 wt% Cu and 24–26 wt% Ni are also required for the manufacture of sintered parts. Compressibility for nickel silver powder at 414 MPa is 7.6 g/cm Nickel silvers along with brasses, next to bronze bearings, are the most widely used materials for structural PM parts. Typical applications include hardware for latch bolts and cylinders for locks; shutter components for cameras; gears, cams and actuator bars in timing assemblies and in small generator drive assemblies; and decorative trims and medallions. In many of these applications, corrosion resistance, wear resistance and artistic appearance play important roles. Currently, a number of companies manufacture premixed bronze powders in a ‘press ready’ condition and formulated to customer specific requirements (see  The oxide reduction and electrolytic deposition were the first large-scale production of copper powders. In the USA, it still remains one of the main commercial processes for copper powder manufacturing. In this process, particulate copper oxide is transformed to copper at elevated temperature in reducing gases. The sintered porous cake produced is then ground to powder. Originally, the initial charge for reduction was copper mill scale or cement copper. However, as copper powder of higher purity was required, particulate copper of high purity (chopped scrap or atomized powder) as starting material was oxidized to cuprous or cupric oxide or a mixture of both. Melting is usually carried out in either fuel-fired or induction furnaces. It is important to ensure a very low content of elements that form very stable oxides, such as Al and Si which reduce the compressibility of the powder and also make it abrasive, while tin and lead additions cause difficulties in pouring the melt due to incrustation and clogging in the furnaces and nozzles. In the case of applications of copper powder for electrical and friction parts, it is important to remove the impurities with harmful effect on electrical and thermal conductivity (see Large-scale atomization is usually run as a continuous process. Molten copper may be discharged through a tube in the side of the furnace wall and directly atomized, or through a tundish. Both air and water may be used as atomized medium, but horizontal air atomization into a rotating drum eliminates the need for dewatering and drying of the powder. Micrographs of air-atomized and water-atomized powders are shown in There are two copper oxides, the red cuprous oxide, Cu where ΔG is free energy in calories per gram per mole, where ΔH is heat in calories per gram per mole; Oxidation or roasting of copper powder in commercial conditions is usually carried out in air at temperatures above 650°C. Oxidation in fluidized beds or in rotary kilns provides higher oxidation rates as a result of increasing the contact between powder and oxidizing gas. However, due to the strongly exothermic nature of the oxidation reaction, these operations are more difficult to control than roasting in a belt conveyer furnace. Both cuprous oxide and cupric oxide powders are brittle and easy to grind to particle size below 150 μm. Furthermore, they are porous. Reducing atmospheres include hydrogen, dissociated ammonia, or other exothermic or endothermic gas mixtures. The typical reduction temperature ranges from 425 to 650°C. At temperatures of 700°C and above, sintering of the product may take place. Reduction of particulate copper oxide is generally accomplished in a continuous belt furnace with a stainless steel belt. The depth of copper oxide bed is approximately 25 mm in which reduction happens gradually from top to bottom during motion of the conveyor belt in the countercurrent of the reducing atmosphere. Exothermic reduction processes especially need a careful control of reducing atmosphere content, oxide particle size, reduction temperature and other processing parameters to optimize the reduction rate and to adjust the pore structure. Hydrogen is a more effective reducing agent than carbon monoxide, especially at low temperature. However, at higher temperatures all reduction reactions in the presence of either hydrogen or carbon monoxide go to completion. In the simultaneous presence of cations of alkali metals and 0.03–0.05 wt% Se or Te, the reduction is accelerated significantly, the process can be carried out at lower temperature, dispersivity and plasticity of powder particles increase [ The reaction of the copper oxide reduction can be written:  Regulation of the reduction process controls the particle porosity, pore size and particle size distribution of the final powder over a wide range. As with other metal oxides, low reduction temperatures usually lead to the production of particles having fine porosity and correspondingly high specific surface. High reduction temperatures lead to the production of particles containing large pores and low specific surface. High reduction temperatures generally result in more complete reduction and interparticle sintering. The reduced copper oxide appears from the reduction belt furnace as a porous cake. It is usually disintegrated in two stages. Primarily, the cake is broken into smaller pieces in a jaw crusher or similar equipment, accompanied by fine grinding in hammer mills. Then, the reduced and milled powder is screened and, if necessary, blended and generally treated by proprietary antioxidants to stabilize it against oxidation. Without this treatment, copper powders, especially when exposed to moist air, usually tarnish, with attendant detriment to green strength and other side effects. With increasing oxidation, the color of the powder changes from orange to purple to black. Oxygen content increases from a typical 0.1–0.2 wt% to several tenths of a percent, and may amount to 1 wt%. Powders with large specific surface area are more sensitive to discoloration. Complete lots of powder are subjected to a series of tests designed to ensure performance in various applications. When using copper mill scale as starting material for making oxide-reduced copper powder, additional treatment to remove impurities is required before reduction. Typical copper scale contains: 75–87 wt% Cu, 2–2.5 wt% SiO The scale is normally annealed in air at temperatures above 627°C. Then, after accomplishment of the oxidation process, the copper oxide produced in the form of porous cake is finely ground. Before reduction, it is treated with a 10–15% solution of sulfuric acid at 177 ± 5°C; at which powder yield is 60–70%, however, etching solutions appear, sulfuric acid consumption is 0.9 tonne per tonne of finished powder. During reduction of copper oxide, a copper scale-to-slag weight ratio is up to 1:1. The apparent density of reduced copper powder with size fractions below 75 μm ground in ball mills is 3.05 g/cm A copper scale treatment technique is also known [ If the feed material includes impurities, they are preliminarily eliminated by hydrochemical processes. Thus, processing of a low-grade scrap by the ammonia method – ammonium-carbonate leaching and distillation of the solution (120–160 g/L Cu, treatment with steam or at 107–127°C during 2.5–3.0 hours) -results in precipitation of alkaline copper carbonate. Depending on scrap composition, the precipitate can include nickel, cobalt, zinc, arsenic and cadmium, Typical properties of a commercial copper powder produced by the solid phase reduction of copper oxide are shown in In the electrolytic process, copper is electrodeposed to obtain a spongy powder deposit at the cathode rather than a smooth, adherent one. In this feature, it differs from the process of copper refining where a strongly adherent product is desired. Low copper ion concentration and high acid content in the electrolyte favor formation of powder deposits. High cathode current density and use of an electrolytically refined copper anode also facilitate the formation of powder. Along with these conditions, control of additional variables is necessary to produce powders that satisfy commercial requirements. These variable parameters include quantity and type of addition agent, temperature and circulation rate of the electrolyte, size and type of anode and cathode, electrode spacing and brush-down interval. A technological scheme of the electrolytic process is shown in Copper content in the electrolyte must be fairly low to prevent adherent deposits. In the desired range, current efficiency rises with increasing ion concentration, with a maximum to 92% in the range from 23 to 33 g/L copper, as shown in [ Certain additional agents to the sulfate/sulfuric acid electrolyte are used to alter powder characteristics. It was reported [ High current density accelerates the powder formation, but has a minor effect on current efficiency. An appreciable decrease in particle size takes place as current density is increased. Thus, in an electrolyte containing 25 g/L copper and 120 g/L free sulfuric acid, increasing the current density from 600 to 1000 A/m Raising the operating temperature of the cell increases the current efficiency and reduces the cell voltage. However, cell operation is hindered at temperatures higher than 60°C and powders produced at elevated temperatures are coarser than those obtained at lower temperatures. Therefore, electrolytic cells are operated at temperatures ranging from 25 to 60°C. The method used to remove the powder deposit from the cathode and the brush-down intervals have a significant effect on powder properties. Commonly, the powder is removed mechanically by means of brushing. The brush-down interval assists in control of the particle size of the deposit. As shown in [  Details of operating conditions including fundamentals of the electroprocess are contained in As has been mentioned, the production of the electrolytic copper powder, as illustrated in Generally, the anodes are electrolytically refined copper and the cathodes are antimonial lead sheet. In a typical installation, the cathodes are 610 × 860 × 9.5 mm in dimension [  In another method [ Such a technique is used at the copper-smelting plant of Uralelectromed Company. The electrolyte (copper sulfate and sulfuric acid) circulates in a closed loop system, passing through the electrolyzers, pressure tanks and heat exchanger. The dendritic copper powder deposited on the cathodes is removed once per 2–3 hours by shaking. On removal from the bath, the powder slurry is transferred to a centrifuge, where the electrolyte is removed and the powder washed. The addition of surface-active agents, such as certain fatty acid salts, during washing protects the powder from oxidation [ Grinding is another operation in which powder properties can be altered. When fine grinding is performed in high-speed hammer mills, feed rate, mill speed and discharge screen openings under the mill can be varied to obtain the powder characteristics desired. The powder leaving the hammer mills is delivered to screens where the oversize is separated and returned for additional grinding. The undersize of 150 μm powder is classified in an air classifier and the fines are transferred to the blending operation. Oversize product is returned for regrinding or is used as melting stock. The finished powders are stored in the drams to which a drying agent such as silica gel or camphor is added to prevent further oxidation. In the case of high volume finished powder that meets customer specifications, powder is selected from various batches in appropriate proportions and mixed in a blender. The lot is sampled before being removed from the blender and, if required, corrections of the particle size distribution are made before the powder is packed in shipping drums. The properties of electrolytic copper powder depends on various parameters of the operation and, therefore, can be adjusted by modification of certain process variables. Properties of typical commercial grades of electrolytic powders are shown in A feature of powder produced by the electrolytic process is high purity, with a copper content usually exceeding 99.5 wt%. A measure of the oxygen content is obtained by exposing a sample of powder to hydrogen flow at an elevated temperature as specified in ISO 4491-2, ASTM E 159, MPIF 02, and CIS GOST 29006-91 (For detailed information on this method, see the description in the section ‘Determination of oxygen content by reduction methods’ in Particle size distribution is selected to suit the application and can be varied over a wide range. Only several combinations are shown in Apparent densities of electrolytic powders are available usually from 0.65 to 3.2g/cm Generally, powders with density of less than about 1.3 g/cm The green density is a function of the compacting pressure. Depending on particle distribution of the dendritic powder blends used, the green densities amount to 6.0–6.3 g/cm The particle shape of deposited electrolytic copper is generally dendritic, as is shown in The compacting pressure is an important variable to take into account, because the pressing and sintering conditions have an appreciable influence on the properties of sintered compacts. During sintering, the gases from the atmosphere, from the products of reduction, or from the lubricant must escape, if conducting compacts are to be obtained. So, when the compacting pressure is too high, the flow through interconnected pores may be hindered and gas cannot escape. Compacting pressures not higher than 275 MPa should be used in the production of large, thick parts from electrolytic copper powder, though, higher pressures can be used for thin-walled parts [ The tensile strength and elongation of parts made from a typical powder blend in relationship to compacting pressure and sintering time are shown in Powder metallurgy techniques have long been successful in the production of parts containing highly The test data represent an example of such processing ( Compression should not be too high during the first compacting since this would hinder the escape of the lubricant from the specimen to be sintered. Even small lubricant residues spoil the electrical conductivity. Currently, electrolytic copper powder is produced in England, Germany, Italy, Russia, Japan, India and Brazil, where it is used in most copper powder applications. The production of electrolytic copper powder has recommenced in the USA where, in the early 1980s, it was stopped and replaced by oxide reduction or water atomization. Electrolytic copper powder is still the powder of choice in many electrical and electronic applications, where high electrical and thermal conductivity is required. Complex parts such as armature bearing blocks, contacts for circuit breakers, heavy-duty Electrolytic copper is still the preferred powder in the manufacture of electrical brushes due to possession of a combination of purity, high electrical conductivity, high surface area and particle dendritic shape which allow a large volume of graphite to be accommodated in a copper matrix with high conductivity and high green strength. Electrolytic copper powder is used with various non-metallic materials to produce friction parts, such as linings for clutches and brakes. Premixes of iron–copper or iron–copper–carbon are utilized in various automotive applications (gears, camps, sprockets, piston rings) and similar components. The basic hydrometallurgical processing steps consist of leaching the raw material, accompanied by the precipitation of the metal from the solution. The most significant precipitation methods are cementation, reduction generally with hydrogen at normal or elevated atmosphere pressure, and electrolysis.  The leaching of copper sulfide and copper oxide ores entails partial dissolution to cupric sulfate with sulfuric acid and iron sulfate. The presence of pyrites in many ore deposits, and its reaction with water and oxygen to form iron sulfate and sulfuric acid, creates an important source of acid. In dump leaching, the pH of the solution is maintained between 1.5 and 3.0, partly to preserve bacteria that promote and accelerate the oxidation of purity and copper sulfate minerals and also to prevent hydrolysis of iron salts. The copper content of the solution varies from less than 1 g/L to several grams per liter. Other leaching methods include ammonia leaching, which is used for certain copper oxide ores. These methods are called leach-precipitation-flotation and are applied to mixed sulfide ores. There are also leaching technique involving the precipitation of the metal from organic phases [ Copper powders can be precipitated from ammoniacal, sulfurous and organic media by reduction with hydrogen, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. The most effective reducer is hydrogen. Thermodynamic data for a number of reactions of copper precipitation under pressure are provided in where Reduction of Cu (II) ions includes the stage of Cu (I) ions formation; their equilibrium concentration under the conditions, when temperature T ranges from 40 to 200°C, liquor contains 0.1–0.8 mole/L of Cu The kinetics of copper precipitation from sulfate and ammoniacal media have special features as shown in the generalized equations given in Kinetics of Cu (I) ion formation is described by the equation:  Due to Cu (I) ion formation the accompanying ion-impurities have great importance which can lead to: the oxidation of Cu (I) ions (Fe the formation of not readily soluble compounds with Cu (I) ions which thus pollute the powder (halides, thiocyanates, TeO Accumulated acid during equimolar copper precipitation impairs the kinetics of the process and increases solution activity. One expedient is to add ammonium sulfate or sulfates of the first-group metals (Na Copper precipitation from sulfurous solutions is characterized by high selectivity towards the accompanying impurities. Co-precipitation of ions As (III), Bi (III) and Sb (III) occurs after precipitation of 90–95% Cu. Precious metals are removed quantitatively. Mechanism of Cu (II) reduction with hydrogen is heterolytic and includes the following stages: Solution of gas and saturation of the aqueous phase. Activation of hydrogen with Cu (II) and Cu (I) ions Formation and accumulation of Cu (I) ions Disproportionation of Cu (I) ions in excess of the equilibrium con centration. Process parameters accelerating copper precipitation lead to the production of powder with more fine roundish particles. At Increase in inert sulfate contents causes formation of dispersed roundish powder particles that increases its flow rate and apparent density. The particle shape depends on the sulfate type: roundish with (ammonia or Fe (II) sulfates), elongated with (zinc sulfate 0.08–0.16 mole/L NH Varying the type and surfactant consumption changes copper powder properties within the following limits: specific surface area ranges from 0.02 to 0.18 m Increase in number of densifications from 1 to 6 results in an increase of powder apparent density and flow rate 1.6 times, powder size 1.67 times, powder surface decreases 2 times; conglomerates are formed, the sedimentation rate increases and dehydration becomes easier. Powder particle precipitation rate is 6–9.6 cm/min (particles size is 72–81 μm, apparent density is 0.6–0.84g/cm  At compacting pressure By varying the parameters of the powder precipitation and its subsequent processing, the powder properties can be altered within the following limits: apparent density of 0.5–2.5 g/cm Copper as copper (I) chloride was precipitated from chloride solutions (25 g/L Cu; 20 g/L HCl) at 100°C and Organic reducing agents (sugar, glucose, starch, fructose and sawdust) precipitate copper powder at 160–170°C, density max 15–20 g/L, for 1.0–3.0 hours. However, incomplete copper precipitation, impurity of powder and recycled solution with reducer destruction substances indicate inadaptability (low technological effectiveness) of the tested agents. For hydroxide pulp processing (127–177°C, Process rate with kienetics constant Optimal content of free ammonia should provide production of copper complexes [Cu (NH Ammonia media stimulate co-reduction of nickel together with copper and powder contamination especially where the ratio of Cu Zinc is present in the powder as a result of zinc ammoniate hydrolysis (insufficient amount of total ammonia, elevated temperature); its hydroxide or alkaline carbonates are eliminated from the powder by means of weak acid solution at the washing stage. Basic solution includes 150–160 g/L copper; if the copper content is higher, it becomes unstable during storage. Leaching of metallized feed yields a part of the copper in solution as Cu (I) ammoniate. It is significant for oxygen consumption reduction but does not influence the process rate. Usually, the ratio Cu (I) to Cu (II) is approximately 1.6–2.0. If the temperature is raised from 163 to 204°C, treatment for 45 minutes is required to reduce the residual copper to 1 g/L starting with a solution containing 135 g/L. The recommended temperature is 237–247°C, hydrogen pressure must be not less than 2.1–2.5 MPa. Surfactants as derivatives of polyacrylic acid or ammonium polyacrylate added in quantity of 0.005–0.5 g/L reduce the amount of powder deposited. Densification cycles increase the cooper precipitation rate, appreciably enlarge size and density of powder. Powder particle shape is non-equiaxed. The process includes the following steps: The copper content usually exceeds 99.5%, powder particle size ranges from 5 to 40 μm. Up to 90% of copper in powder form is precipitated from ethylene-diamine copper solutions by hydrogen under pressure (120–140°C,  Processing of lean ores by heap or underground leaching yields weak solutions from which copper is extracted using organic agents to form a saturated metal-organic solution containing 2–10 g/L Cu. The solution undergoes a re-extract and then copper is precipitated from the obtained aqueous solution (30–40 g/L Cu) by electrolysis. Reduction of the saturated organic solution with hydrogen under pressure facilitates the production of copper powder without re-extract. Promising results are obtained by treatment of an organic solution (33% tertiary carbonic acid + kerosene + 530 g/L Cu) with hydrogen at 230–310°C and PH Of the copper-impregnated extracting reagents (LIX-64, LIX-65N, SME-529, Acorgap-5100), the best results were observed on precipitation with reagent LIX-65N. Treatment of the organic solution including 30% LIX-65N, 20% decanol, 50% kerosene and 9.0g/L Cu in the presence of copper powder (30–35% of total solution) at 197–227°C, During processing of ammoniacal solution by sulfur dioxide, the ammonium sulfite copper (I) salt is Copper scrap and metal-bearing precipitates are used rather than other copper-bearing materials. By leaching of copper scrap and metal precipitate (at 37–47°C and maintaining the weight ratio of NH At 27–77°C and PH Copper powder is produced by acidification of the slurry which contains Cu(NH Powder composition is as follows: 99.3–99.8 wt% Cu; 0.01–0.03 wt% S; 0.06–0.2 wt% O A process is known, where the copper salt is dissolved in acetonitrile (AN): (57°C, 50% AN solution, 0.09M SO The anhydride method uses simpler equipment, consumes less power, production costs are lower in comparison with reduction under pressure. However, it is necessary to utilize bought-in ammonium sulfate and the yield of copper directly extracted is less, thus increasing the re-circulating costs. The precipitation of a metal from solution by the addition of another less noble metal is known as cementation. The fundamental equation for copper recovery from copper-bearing liquors using zinc is: Sulfate solution contains 50 g/L of copper and 5–20 g/L of sulfuric acid. The latter hinders the hydrolysis of impurities present in the solution. An additional factor providing high purity of copper powder (97.0–98.5% Cu) is high residual content of copper in the solution (1–2 g/L). Consumption of zinc powder with particle size from 100 to 400 μm is The process is carried out at 50°C in the agitators with mechanic stirrers; the final slurry is filtered; the powder is washed with water, stabilized with 0.05% soap solution and dried. The general precipitation reaction of copper recovery from cupric sulfate by the addition of iron is: Practically, scrap iron, such as detinned and shredded cans, is used. Subsequent separation, washing, reduction and pulverizing results in the production of a copper powder that contains considerable amounts of iron and acid insolubles, such as alumina and silica. For this process, chemical analyses of cement copper from different sources [ Electrowinning is used to recover copper from leach solutions containing more than approximately 25 g/L of copper (Harlan process). The electrolytic cells are equipped with insoluble lead–antimony anodes and 99% Ni cathodes. The copper powder deposits do not stick and gravitate to the bottom of the cells. The temperature of the electrolyte is maintained at 60°C; cathode current varies from 1350 to 2700 A/m Copper may be precipitated from low content leach solutions by solvent extraction, followed by stripping with dilute sulfuric acid into an aqueous solution and electrowinning. Carboxylic acid and hydroxylamine-based compounds have been found to be selective solvents of low water solubility, to have good stability and to be compatible with inexpensive diluents. Another technique is used for obtaining copper powder with electrochemical regeneration of the reducer. Copper is reduced in the solution by titanium ions (III) in the anode space of an electrolyzer ( Copper ions go to the anode space from the soluble anodes. Powder permanently suspended in the electrolyte is recovered by filtration and the filtrate goes back into the cathode space, where the reducer, namely titanium ions (III), is regenerated on the perforated lead cathode. Anode space is separated from the cathode by a diaphragm made of chlorine fiber previously tightened by boiling it in distilled water for 20 min. The level of the catholyte is higher than the anolyte level that ensures the electrolyte flows from the cathode space to the anode. The powder separated on the filter is washed with water to remove electrolyte, stabilized with 0.05% soap solution, then washed again, dried under vacuum at 100–120°C, cooled under vacuum to room temperature and classified. Electrolyte circulated with a speed of 22 L/h contains 184.2 g/L of Ti Various characteristic methods for electrowinning copper and copper alloy powders from leach solutions can be found in  Oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) copper can be produced by several methods [ The internal oxidation method is based on the principle that a copper–aluminum solid solution is internally oxidized at elevated temperature. For effective internal oxidation, oxygen must diffuse into the matrix (copper) several orders of value rather than the solute element (aluminum). Powder metallurgy offers the advantage that powder particles can be internally rapidly oxidized and then consolidated into the required shape. The internal oxidation process involves the low aluminum addition in copper and atomizing the melt by mean of a high pressure inert gas such as nitrogen. The powder obtained is mixed with an oxidant that consists of fine copper oxide powder. Then, the mixture is heated to a high temperature at which the oxide dissociates and the oxygen produced diffuses into the particles of copper–aluminum solid solution. Because aluminum forms oxide more readily than copper, the aluminum in the alloy is preferably oxidized to aluminum oxide. After entire oxidation of the aluminum, surplus oxygen in the powder is reduced by heating the powder in hydrogen or a dissociated ammonia atmosphere. Three grades of ODS copper are commercially available, where are designated as C15715, C15725, and C15760 by the Copper Development Association. The nominal compositions of these grades are: 99.7 wt% (99.3 vol%) Cu, 0.3 wt% (0.7 vol%) Al The powder is consolidated into fully dense shapes by various techniques. Semi-products, such as rod and bar, are made by sealing the powder in a suitable metal container, usually copper, and hot extruding it to the given size. Strip is manufactured either by rolling rods of extruded rectangular bar or by directly Finished parts are made from semi-products by machining, brazing and soldering. Fusion welding is not applicable because it causes the aluminum oxide to precipitate from the liquid copper matrix, accompanied with the loss of dispersion strengthening. While flash welding, in which the liquid metal is squeezed out of the weld joint, and electron beam welding, in which a small heat-affected zone is created, have been used with success. The properties of ODS copper strongly depend on the aluminum oxide content. They can be altered to meet a wide range of design requirements by varying the aluminum oxide content and/or cold work. Typical for rod stock in the hot extruded condition, increasing aluminum oxide content from 0.45 to 2.7 vol% increases the tensile strength from 340 to 670 MPa, while elongation is decreased from 27 to 19%. The free or reducible oxygen content of the above three ODS coppers, usually about 0.02–0.05 wt%, is present in the form of dissolved oxygen and cuprous oxide. Alloys in this state are inclined to hydrogen embrittlement at high temperatures. In these low-oxygen compositions, the reducible oxygen can be converted to non-reducible oxide by adding up to 0.02 wt% boron as an oxygen getter. These grades are then resistant to hydrogen embrittlement. Physical properties of ODS copper closely resemble those of pure copper, since the former contains small amounts of aluminum oxide as discrete particles in an essentially pure copper matrix. Electrical and thermal conductivities range from 78 to 92% of those for pure copper. In combination with the high strengths of these materials, they enhance the current-carrying or heat-dissipation capabilities for a given section size and structural strength. Therefore, they enable reduction of section size for component miniaturization without damage to structural strength or current and heat-carrying capabilities. At elevated temperature, the decrease in electrical and thermal conductivities of ODS coppers does not differ from those of pure copper. ODS copper has high resistance to softening even after exposure to temperatures close to the melting point of copper because the aluminum oxide particles are stable at these temperatures and retain their original size and spacing. At typical brazing and glass-to-metal sealing temperatures (above 600°C), ODS coppers retain their strength while OF copper loses its strength. At above 600°C, the ODS coppers have tensile strength comparable to or better than some stainless steels. ODS copper has high thermal stability at elevated temperatures because the aluminum oxide particles retain their initial particle size and spacing even after prolonged heating and prevent recrystallization of the matrix. Oxide dispersion strengthened copper has received wide market acceptance in series applications [          Basic applications for copper and copper-base PM materials are summarized in An assortment of bearings and parts of sintered bronze are shown in Various configuration carbon brushes suitable for conducting electrical current in sliding contacts are pictured in Friction materials are required as linings for clutches and brakes. Typical arrangements are shown in Formation and functional effectiveness of the supporting of the metallic matrix depend decisively on metal powder used. Dendritic copper powders ensure high green strength, intensive bonding between particles and high sintering activity, especially with the addition of elementary tin and liquid phase sintering. Filters made of sintered bronze, exhibited in Generally, manufacture is by the loose powder sintering process, and sintering is done in graphite or steel dies, mostly under hydrogen or cracked ammonia. Sintering temperatures are about 785°C, sintering times approximately 60 min. Spherical bronze powder contains about 0.35% phosphorus. The latter increases the surface tension of the melt to be atomized and so ensures a good spherical particle shape. The addition of phosphorus also reduces the solidus temperature of the tin bronze to about 700°C, which in turn allows the advantages of liquid phase sintering to be accomplished.  Copper in drinking water imparts a foul taste and is related to the third, next to last class of danger and the TLV is 1.0 mg/l according to CIS State Standard 4630-88 [ Copper powder <44 μm does not inflame in an aerogel state as well as in a suspended solid one in air. Data about combustibility of copper dust and some bronze and brass compositions also on prevention of inflammability can be found in
