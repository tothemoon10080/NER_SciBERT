 Fractures of radial head and neck primarily do not pose any problem in diagnosis and in simple type fractures, i.e. fractures with three or only two fragments, treatment is very standardized. Problems arise in all fractures that are comminuted, massively displaced, head fractures that are associated with an additional neck fracture, fractures that were caused by elbow dislocation or subluxation and especially fractures that occur in complex, i.e. open fracture types.  On thorough anamnesis patients might describe a subluxed or dislocated elbow that was reduced spontaneously or by the patients themselves. Patients complain of pain, limited movement with increase of pain on attempted motion in the elbow joint. In fractures due to elbow dislocation/subluxation patients complain of a feeling of instability in the elbow joint with the fear of spontaneous re-subluxation. Swelling might be minimal to massive depending on the mechanism of injury and the amount of intra-articular bony and ligamentous, i.e. instability, damage.  Stability of the elbow joint in the frontal as well as sagittal plane has to be examined after plain X-rays. Before X-ray examination blood perfusion, sensitivity as well as motor function distal to the elbow joint has to be evaluated and, in massive trauma with dislocated elbow (especially in the child), potential development of a compartment syndrome has to be taken into account and ruled out. X-ray evaluation consists of ap- and lateral films and, in proven radial head fractures, in an additional special oblique view of the radial head. Besides obvious fracture lines, ‘pat pad signs’, i.e. swelling of the joint capsule anterior and posterior to the distal humerus, have to be taken into account, especially in children. If there is comminution of the radial head, if there are unclear additional fragments potentially originating from the Capitulum humeri, the Trochlea or the Condyles/Epicondyles, we see an indication for a CT-examination with coronal as well as sagittal reconstructions. The CT-examination will give us all the necessary information, whether we will have to address the radial head/neck fracture only or whether there will be the necessity to operatively fix additional osteochondral fragments, torn out collateral ligaments, Capitulum fractures or Milch's fractures of the Trochlea. Classification can be done either by the AO-CCF or, which to me is more operational, by the MASON Classification for the radial head and the JUDET Classification for radial neck fractures.  Indication for surgery is dependent on: Concomitant injuries to other bony as well as ligamentous/chondral structures (difficult to detect without MRI) of the elbow, pulse or sensory deficiency distal to the elbow as well as the development of a compartment syndrome of the forearm. Amount of dislocation of the radial head in radial neck fractures. (Crucial in physeal fractures in children.) Amount of dislocation of fragment/fragments in radial head fractures. Number of fracture fragments of radial head (more than 3, comminution and combined fracture of radial head and neck). Timing of surgery is dependent on: Expired time between accident and first presentation of patient. Massively displaced radial neck fractures in children are an emergency, with a similar approach in adults. (We believe that with the compromised vascularity of the radial head after a displaced neck fracture reduction and fixation should be done as soon as possible to allow for revascularisation and uneventful bone healing.) In MASON 2, JUDET 1 and 2 fractures patients undergo surgery electively.  Conservative treatment: After diagnosis, definitive classification and the decision for a conservative treatment, the latter one must be reconsidered at least once and the patient has to be thoroughly informed about potential complications of non-operative treatment, because: Conservative treatment is a perfect option in MASON 1 and some – small displacement angle – JUDET 1 fracture types, but the patient has to understand that after conservative treatment in MASON 1 as well as JUDET 1 fractures there is a tendency – after regaining FROM – of the forearm to either angulate in a slight varus or valgus position in full supination and full extension, i.e. a change of the ‘carrying angle’ (similar to the changes after insufficient treatment of supracondylar humeral fractures in children but due to another pathomechanism). This angulation might occur dependent on the position of the radial head fragment and its primary displacement. The former will not be of functional consequences to the patient but might result in a cosmetic problem, especially in skinny patients. Conservative treatment consists of a 14 up to 21 days period of immobilisation in an upper arm splint with extension/flexion exercises commencing as early as 14 days post-accident. Pro-/supination should start two to three weeks post injury with load transmission not sooner than 5 weeks after the primary diagnosis. Operative treatment: In displaced MASON 2 and 3 fractures ORIF is carried out using a minimal approach directly towards the radial head with screw fixation of the reduced fragments using 2.0 If more than three to four fragments have to be reduced, if stable fixation of the fractured radial head to the radial neck cannot be achieved, then treatment options are massively reduced. Treatment options are pre-bend 1.5 2.0 condylar blade plates, special radial neck/head plates with uncertain functional results, primary resection of the radial head, approximately 1.0 primary implantation of a cemented/uncemented radial head prosthesis (Results of the last treatment option are depending on the patient's compliance, his occupation and concomitant injuries to the elbow.) The application of an additional hinged Ex Fix for 6 weeks after the implantation of a radial head prosthesis is a further treatment option if the elbow subluxes even after prosthetic replacement of the radial head. Long-term results after primary radial head resection as well as after primary prosthetic replacement, results that are depending on the patients needs, age and physical requirements, are still insecure. As a consequence we are still unable to give solidly founded evidence based recommendations. Besides surgical treatment of the bony fracture, it is of paramount importance to reconstruct, depending on the treatment option chosen, disrupted collateral ligaments, especially on the ulnar aspect of the joint. Peri- and post-operative administration (for a minimum of 14 days post-operatively) of Indomethacin 2× 75  The decision to carry out a primary resection or a primary prosthetic replacement of the radial head depends on the amount of comminution of the radial head and on the patient's needs in occupational life and his ability to comply.
