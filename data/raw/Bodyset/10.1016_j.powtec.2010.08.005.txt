Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) was crystallized in the presence of O-carboxymethylchitosan (CMCS) by a vapor diffusion method. The CaCO3 particles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the energy dispersion spectroscopies (EDS), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and N2 adsorptionâ€“desorption methods. By varying the concentrations of CMCS, Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions, and temperature, the CaCO3 nanocrystals with different morphologies were produced. Based on the analysis of CaCO3 particles obtained under different conditions, the mechanism of the CaCO3 crystallization in the presence of CMCS was proposed.In living organisms, a variety of solid inorganic materials with interesting properties and hierarchical structures are synthesized in the presence of organic additives Calcium carbonate (CaCO A variety of biomacromolecules such as, polypeptide In organisms, the biomineralization proceeds slowly under mild conditions, therefore, it is very important to investigate the biomineralization process under vapor diffusion method CMCS of biomedical grade ( CaCl The size and morphology of CaCO When the concentration of Ca The XRD patterns ( The diffraction peaks intensity of the particles precipitated in CMCS solutions is much smaller than those in the absence of CMCS. The result is consistent with that obtained by Wada et al.  The TGA curve ( To investigate whether the CMCS molecules adsorb on the surfaces or reside in CaCO When the concentration of CMCS is fixed at 1.0 The influence of temperature on the CaCO In CMCS solutions, the morphology and polymorph of the CaCO The decomposition rate of (NH In many systems, Mg The CaCO Leeuw However, calcite aggregates composed of nanocrystals are obtained even at the highest In order to explore the mechanism of CaCO When CMCS is absent and the aging time is 4 When CMCS is present and the aging time is 2 Compared with the rhombohedral particles precipitated in solutions without CMCS, the aggregation among the CaCO Based on the investigations of CaCO CaCO Some influencing factors, such as CMCS with larger concentration, Ca Supplementary materials related to this article can be found online at The following are the supplementary materials related to this article The authors show great appreciation for the financial support from the
