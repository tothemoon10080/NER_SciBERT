Solvent extraction of iron (III) from the HCl leach liquor of low grade iron ore tailings was studied with Aliquat 336, a quaternary amine in kerosene. p-Nonyl phenol was used as the third phase modifier. The effect of different parameters such as equilibration time, HCl concentration, H+ concentration, Cl− concentration and extractant concentration on extraction of iron was studied. The effect of different diluents such as xylene, benzene, toluene, diphenyl ether, diethyl ether, cyclohexane, hexanol, cyclohexanol and butanol on extraction of iron was investigated. The effect of various salts such as NaCl, NaNO3, Na2SO4, NaOOCCH3, and Na3C6H5O7·2H2O in the feed solution within the concentrations of 0.5 to 2.5M on extraction of iron was studied. It was observed that extraction of iron increased from 51.82 to 97.52% and from 5.81 to 97.19% with increase in HCl and extractant concentrations from 1.67 to 9.7M and from 0.025 to 0.4M, respectively. From the slope analysis study, the number of moles of H+, Cl− and Aliquat 336 associated with the extracted species was determined and the extracted species was found to be R3NCH3
                     ·FeCl4. The McCabe–Thiele plot for extraction of iron with 0.2M Aliquat 336 illustrated 2-stages at 1:1 phase ratio and the loaded organic contained 0.338M (18.8496kg/m3) iron indicating 98.57% extraction. The stripping of iron from the loaded organic carried out with distilled water showed quantitative stripping in 3-stages at O:A ratio of 2:1.Usually iron is economically recovered from high grade ores through the conventional flotation and pyrometallurgical routes, but it is not easy to recover iron from low grade iron ores or low grade iron ore tailings by the conventional method. Again, the presence of iron in acidic leach liquor is a common problem in most of the hydrometallurgical processing. Removal of iron from the acidic leach liquors is usually carried out via precipitation and solvent extraction techniques. The present paper deals with the solvent extraction of iron from the hydrochloric acid leach liquors of low grade iron ore tailings with Aliquat 336 in kerosene. Literature on solvent extraction of Fe(III) with Aliquat 336 is scanty; however, a variety of other extractants such as D2EHPA, PC88A, Cyanex 272, Cyanex 301, Cyanex 302, Cyanex 923, TBP, TOPO, TOA, Alamine 336, LIX 860 and LIX 984 have been used for the purpose. In extraction of iron(III) from an acidic sulphate solution by didecylamine sulphate in benzene at 25 Extraction of iron(III) from a HCl solution was carried out with D2EHPA, PC 88A and Cyanex 272 and their mixtures in kerosene ( The extraction of iron(III) from a chloride solution bearing 1 Aliquat 336 (a mixture of tri-octyl/decyl ammonium chloride of average molecular weight 442 The low grade iron ore collected from Minerals Matrics Limited (MML), India was beneficiated at Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology (CSIR), Bhubaneswar. After beneficiation, the tailings contained 13.375% Fe, 0.8% Al All the experiments were carried out at room temperature (30 The effect of HCl concentration within the range of 1.67 to 9.77 The plot of log D vs. log [H The effect of chloride ion concentration within 4.696 to 5.596 The effect of Aliquat 336 concentration within 0.025–0.4 The plot of log D vs log [extractant] for extraction of iron as shown in Extraction of iron from the HCl medium with the quaternary amine (Aliquat 336) can be expressed as follows: The equilibrium constant, K or Taking logarithm for the Eq. From the slope analysis study obtained above, the above extraction mechanism is confirmed. The effect of different aromatic and aliphatic diluents such as benzene, toluene, xylene, diphenylether, butanol, hexanol, diethyllether, cyclohexane and cyclohexanol on extraction of Fe(III) was studied at different HCl concentrations within 1.667 to 9.768 To study the effect of various salts such as NaCl, Na To recover iron from the solution containing 0.342 The loaded organic phase containing 0.338 The effect of temperature on extraction of iron was studied in the range of 283 to 323 The Gibbs–Helmholtz equation for enthalpy and entropy change can be written as: The ln k The values of ∆H, ∆G and ∆S obtained for Fe extraction are given in The FTIR absorption spectra of Aliquat 336, metal loaded Aliquat 336 and of Aliquat 336 after stripping were recorded to know the interaction between the extractant and the metal ion. The spectra of extractants and their complexes with iron are shown in The ―C―H symmetric and asymmetric deformation vibrations and stretching vibrations for pure and Fe-bonded Aliquat 336 as shown in the The extraction of iron from the HCl leach liquor of the low grade iron ore tailings was carried out with Aliquat 336 in kerosene and the following conclusions were drawn from the study.
