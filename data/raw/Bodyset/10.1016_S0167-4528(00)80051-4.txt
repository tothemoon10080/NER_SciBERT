The problem of separation of elements from rare earth is one of the most difficult methods in inorganic chemistry. In this paper we used for yttrium separation a chemical concentrate of 83.5% rare earth with a percent content of 51% yttrium. The most useful method for lanthanides separation is liquid-liquid extraction using different types of organic extractants. We used di-(2ethylhexil)phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) and the complexing agent was diethyltriamine-penta-acetic (DTPA). We obtained the yields with high purity using a process with minimal number of operations.
