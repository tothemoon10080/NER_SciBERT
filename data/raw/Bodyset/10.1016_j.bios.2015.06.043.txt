In the present study, we manifest that traditionally used gold nanoparticles when supported on molybdenum disulfide nanoribbons matrix (MoS2 NRs–Au NPs) show synergistically enhanced intrinsic peroxidase like catalytic activity and can catalyze the oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′ tetramethyl benzidine by H2O2 to produce a highly sensitive blue shade product depending on level of free cholesterol, when tested on complex system of human serum. Further the system attests appreciable kinetics, owing to K

                     Ms−1). Additionally, the proposed system is stable for weeks with ability to perform appreciably in wide pH (3–6) and temperature range (25–60°C). Utilizing this potential, the present work proposes a cholesterol detection color wheel which is used along with cost effective cholesterol detection strips fabricated out of proposed MoS2 NRs–Au NPs system for quick and reliable detection of free cholesterol using unaided eye.Ubiquitous deaths and diseases due to hypercholesterolemia, which is a byproduct of present generation eating habits demand non-invasive, economic, quick and reliable diagnostic system in order to check the increasing levels of free cholesterol. An elevated level of free cholesterol leads to atherosclerosis which in worst cases culminates into fatal heart attacks (developing countries problem in medical facilities) ( Recently, colorimetric methods have shown promising potential in applications owing to their ability to be perceived using simple unaided eye and thus have been applied for detection of DNA ( With high surface area as one of the prime requirement, layered nanomaterials were expected entries in the colorimetric detection domain. Transition Metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) having layered structures have commendable properties and have proved their potential for applications in various domains such as semiconductor, optoelectronics, spintronics, catalysts, super capacitors, solar cells, and lithium ion batteries ( Hence realizing the potential of very recent candidate in the field of peroxidase like activity material, that is MoS Ammonium heptamolybdate tetra hydrate (AHM, (NH All the intermediate products and final product, that is MoS Stock solution of TMB (10 Cholesterol detection was done as follows: (a) 50 The cholesterol detection strips were fabricated using simple economic cellulose strips on which proposed MoS The proposed synthesis route, as shown schematically in ( The peroxidase-like activity of the MoS As the first step, the absorption study was done, as shown in However, Good catalytic activity, as confirmed above, is definitely one of the most parameter for being a potential peroxidase like material, but it is certainly not the only requirement. Appreciable enhancements have been achieved by HRP and its natural enzyme mimetics as well, but it is the stability and resistance to environmental factors that have restricted their use, making them useful only in a narrow pH range and that too below a certain temperature (60 Realizing kinetics as the next important parameter to be addressed, we investigate the kinetic mechanism of the peroxidase-like activity of the MoS Where, With significant kinetics and efficiency in detecting H Assured of the admirable peroxidase like activity of proposed MoS Furthermore, because the color changes from colorless to blue when the system detects cholesterol, which is observable by the naked eyes, this technique enables easy to realize visual detection without any instrumentation or complicated design. Although, the actual quantification of the cholesterol level requires the absorption study as discussed above, but the most acknowledgeable point here is that the shades of blue color obtained are in direct relation with the amount of cholesterol in the analytes which is evident in In conclusion, we report cost effective synthesis of MoS NRN acknowledges the financial assistance from Supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version at
