Although neural networks are universal approximators, they are black-box models and it is difficult to obtain a suitable neural structure for a special unknown nonlinear system. Since many physical systems can be modeled by mechanistic models, we use these information to modify the normal neural identifiers and propose a novel neural modeling approach in this paper. This model includes a linear model which is linearized from the mechanistic model and a multilayer neural network. By Lyapunov stability approach, we prove that this hybrid neuro is stable in present of parameter and structure uncertainties. Then we apply these theory results on rare-earth extraction process. The results of application show that this new method can be used as soft-sensor of complex nonlinear systems.
