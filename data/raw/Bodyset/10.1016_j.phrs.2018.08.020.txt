Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most common valvular disorder in the elderly, with the incidence of 3% in general population of Western countries. The initial phase of CAVD is characterized by leaflet thickening and possible spotty calcification (i.e. aortic valve sclerosis (AVSc)), while advanced stages have leaflets structure degeneration (i.e. aortic valve stenosis (AS)). The pathological cellular and molecular mechanisms, involved in CAVD, are extracellular matrix degradation, aberrant matrix deposition, fibrosis, mineralization, inflammation, lipid accumulation, and neo-angiogenesis. CAVD clinical risk shares considerable overlap with those of atherosclerosis and they include hypertension, smoking habits, and hyperlipidemia. Unfortunately, surgical aortic valve replacement and transcatheter aortic valve implantation are the only available treatments when the disease become severe and symptoms occur. Indeed, no approved pharmacological approach is available for CAVD patients. In this review, we describe the current literature evidence on possible future therapeutic targets for this debilitating and fatal disease such as PCSK9, P2Y2 receptor, cadherin 11, and DDP-4.Co-localization between Ox-LDL, T-lymphocyte accumulation, and calcium deposits in aortic valve Fibrocalcific remodeling of valvular tissue in AS OxLDL-derived LPA promotes the progression of CAVD Elevated Ox-PL increased the risk of CAVD progression in younger patients Associations of OxPL-apoB and OxPL-apo(a) with risk of developing CAVD Highly expressed in CAV, mineralization process of VICs Increased Lp-PLA2 activity associated with a faster stenosis progression in patients with mild AS Accumulates in developing lesions of aortic stenosis High Lp(a) levels are associated with AVC High Lp(a) levels are associated with an increased risk for CAVD Elevated Lp(a) levels (>90 mg/dL) predicted a 3-fold increased risk of AS and progression of CAVD (20 years follow-up study) Elevated Lp(a) increased risk of CAVD progression in younger patients LOF mutation of PCSK9 (R46 L) was associated with lower levels of LDL, lower levels of Lp(a) and with reduced risk of AS PCSK9 correlated with the presence but not with the severity of CAVD Relationship between low HDL levels and fast CAVD progression P2Y2R activates mineralization process of VICs Implication of PiT-1 in AVC processes Inhibition of DDP-4 activity blocked the osteogenic changes in human VICs Ox-LDL-derived lysophosphatidic acid promoted the progression of CAVD P2Y2R agonists promoted the membrane translocation of carbonic anhydrase XII that led to a regression of the mineralization of the aortic valve PPARγ agonists attenuated AVC progression DDP-4 inhibition reduced AVC DDP-4 inhibition caused a calcium deposits reduction in the aortic valve 5-HT2B antagonism blocked Src phosphorylation, prevented non-canonical TGF-β1 signaling activation, and inhibited VIC myofibroblastic differentiation Cadherin 11 expression were associated with the differentiation of fibroblasts and calcific nodule formation of aortic VICs Cadherin 11-blocking antibody (SYN0012) inhibit AS AVC is completely abolished in cathepsin S deficient mice Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is an active and multifactorial pathological process that starts with the alteration of leaflet cellular mechanisms, leading to matrix remodeling and subsequently to calcification with hemodynamic obstruction [ The classic triad of symptoms of severe AS are heart failure, syncope, and angina. Once these symptoms occur, surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are the only available strategies to treat the patients affected by this debilitating and fatal disease [ Recently, genetic association and predisposition to high levels of plasma lipids were shown to correlate with presence of aortic valve calcification (AVC), in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genetic Epidemiology study, and with AS, in the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study [ Parolari et al. [ Partially, the ineffectiveness of statins in these clinical trials might be explained by the advanced stage of the disease. Hence, it has been proposed that lipid-lowering therapy should be initiated in early stage of CAVD in order to prevent AS. However, in the SEAS trail, that assessed patients with mild-to-moderate AS (n = 1′873), simvastatin treatment did not reduce cardiovascular events associated with CAVD [ Otto et al. [ The relationship between circulating oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) levels and fibrocalcific remodeling of valvular tissue in AS has been previously reported [ This being said, the hypothesis to use lipid-lowering therapy such as statins at AVSc stage has been put aside since AVSc is still considered a normal echocardiography finding and too many patients will have to be treated to “only” save a small proportion of them who will develop AS and thus requiting aortic valve replacement when AS will reach the severe stage. Hence, until AVSc will not be recognized as a pathological condition and, more important, until reliable biomarkers (such as bio-humoral or imaging) that will identify AVSc patients with high-risk to develop AS, the use of lipid-lowering therapy will not be sustainable in this particular context. Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] [ Elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, independently of LDL levels [ A significant association between Lp(a) and CAVD was previously reported [ In 1995, Gotoh et al. [ Recently, in a prospective study in 454 cases of AS incidence in a 20-year follow-up, elevated Lp(a) levels (>90 mg/dL) predicted a 3-fold increased risk of AS, suggesting that Lp(a) levels are associated not only with presence but also with progression of CAVD [ In the Aortic Stenosis Progression Observation: Measuring Effects of Rosuvastatin (ASTRONOMER) trial, elevated oxidized phospholipids and Lp(a) plasma concentrations were independently associated with an increased risk of CAVD progression and this association was more evident in younger patients, providing a strong rationale to test Lp(a)-lowering and/or oxidized phospholipids lowering therapies for reducing CAVD progression [ The statins effect on Lp(a) is controversial. It has been shown that different statins (atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin/ezetimibe) could stimulate the increment of Lp(a) levels up to twenty percent [ The second generation of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that inhibit apo(a) mRNA translation [ Nicotinic acid (niacin) is known to have beneficial effects on very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), LDL, and to significantly lower plasma Lp(a) concentrations [ Recently, a large clinical trial investigated the effect of statin therapy alone or in combination with extended-release niacin (ERN) in patients with CVD but without high levels of LDL at baseline [ The pilot randomized trial Early Aortic Valve Lipoprotein (a) Lowering (EAVaLL) (NCT02109614) was designed to evaluate whether lowering Lp(a) at an early stage of CAVD could affect the disease progression ( In light of these recent trials and studies, we believe that in the future guidelines patients affected by AS should be screened for Lp(a) levels and should be treated if high Lp(a) is found. PCSK9 is a hepatic convertase that binds and internalizes LDL receptors into lysosomes and stimulates their degradation [ Inclisiran is a fully chemically stabilized duplex RNA targeting 3′ UTR of PCSK9 mRNA [ Alirocumab and evolocumab, two monoclonal antibodies that inhibit PCSK9, have been implemented for the treatment of patients with elevated LDL and who have not sufficiently responded to or cannot tolerate statins. These drugs, in addition to radically lowering LDL (up to 70%), are also able to lower plasma Lp(a) (up to 30%) [ In a cohort of Danish individuals (n = 103′083) a LOF mutation of PCSK9 (R46 L) was associated not only with lower levels of LDL but also with lower levels of Lp(a) and with reduced risk of AS and myocardial infarction. These results suggest that individuals with AS could benefit from a therapy with PCSK9 inhibitors [ Currently, on debate is in which way PCSK9 influences Lp(a) levels. It has been shown a correlation between chronic inflammatory infiltrates, osteochondrogenic metaplasia, and neovascularization of aortic valve [ Considering that bone mineralization is the result of a balance between deposit and absorption of minerals, it is reasonable to think that, during disease progression involving the mineralization (CAVD or calcified atherosclerotic plaques) it is possible to shift the balance of this process towards calcium removal [ VICs are the main cellular components involved in AVC. The role of the purinergic receptor 2Y2 (P2Y2R) in the mineralization process of VICs has been reported [ Expression of phosphate-related genes and proteins as sodium-phosphate co-transporter 1 (PiT-1), ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and oteopontin (OPN) was associated with lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) induced mineralization in VICs [ Treatment with sodium phosphonoformate hexahydrate, a PiT-1 inhibitor, effectively reduced Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ) by thiazolidinedione (TZD) mediates positive effects on metabolism regulation, inflammation, apoptosis, and cardiovascular calcification [ Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) enzyme inactivates the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). Thus, DDP-4 inhibitors, preventing GLP-1 inactivation, increase GLP-1 concentration that, in turn, improves the glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes patients [ Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) is highly expressed in calcified aortic valves, promotes the activation of VICs, and induces myofibroblastic differentiation that leads to CAVD [ Cadherin 11, a cell-cell adhesion protein, can be considered another possible target for CAVD treatment since fibroblastic differentiation, induced by TGF-β1 activation, promotes a strong upregulation of cadherin 11. Of note, rise in cadherin 11 expression has been associated with calcific nodule formation of aortic VICs, Interestingly, it was reported that VICs from In human, Notch1 haploinsufficiency resulted in early developmental defects of the aortic valve and later an increment in calcium deposition, leading to severe CAVD with 100% penetrance [ It is worth mentioning that a specific antibody against cadherin 11 is under evaluation in phase I clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis [ The pathophysiological changes in stenotic aortic valves include accumulation and degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM). Elastin, a ubiquitous ECM protein, is a crucial factor in this process, as demonstrated in elastin insufficient mice, in which progressive aortic valve malformation and subsequently valve diseases were observed [ Interestingly, Helske et al. [ The involvement of cathepsin S in CAVD was confirmed in animal models by Aikawa et al. [ These results indicate that the preservation of elastin integrity, for example with a selective inhibition of cathepsin S, may also represent a novel therapeutic strategy in the prevention of CAVD. The recent advances in omics technologies and network medicine allow a better understanding of the CAVD complexity from onset, progression, and treatment [ It is worth mentioning that angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) use in patients with AS and hypertension are extensively reported in the literature and actually, represent the first treatment of choice even if clinical studies reported contradictory results [ In conclusion, nowadays there is no effective pharmacological treatment for the patients with overt CAVD. It is worth mentioning that after symptoms manifestation, CAVD mortality occurs within 5 years without aortic valve replacement [ Thanks to the new multi-omic approach, we will be able to considerably advance our knowledge of molecular and cellular pathways involved in this multifactorial disease, allowing us to unravel new targets to be exploited in CAVD pharmacological therapies and appropriated follow up. Finally, to tackle CAVD effectively, we believe that it will be important: 1) to identify and treat patients in the early stage of the disease to halt CAVD progression; 2) to focus the attention not only on risk factors known to affect the atherosclerotic disease but also on direct pathological mechanisms involved in CAVD; and 3) to intensify the effort to design new studies focused on “direct therapy” of CAVD, such as P2Y2 receptor, cadherin 11 and DDP-4.
