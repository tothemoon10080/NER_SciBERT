The paper presents the results of a physical and mechanical characterization of a compressible and crushable volcanic ash collected during a recent eruptive event of Mount Etna. The characterization of this complex natural material required appropriate equipment, to carry out a comprehensive experimental programme, and a rigorous scientific approach to critically analyze the experimental results and put them in the theoretical framework of soil mechanics and of critical state theory. The experimental activities involved X-ray diffractometry, electron scanning microscopy (SEM) and one-dimensional compression tests carried out on both wet and dry soil specimens characterized by different initial densities. To examine the effects of loading on the evolution of the micro-structure, both the particle size distribution and the particle shape, before and after the tests, were analyzed through a dynamic image analysis using several size and shape parameters.
                  The experimental results show that grain crushing becomes evident at vertical pressures larger than 1MPa whereas it seems to be progressively inhibited for pressures larger than 10MPa. Furthermore, regardless the initial void ratio of the soil specimens, at high stresses the obtained non-linear e −logσ′v relationship converges toward a unique limiting compression curve.The eruptions of Mount Etna typically produce lava flows from the summit craters and from fissures opening on the flanks of the volcano. However, the activity of Mount Etna has always been characterized by spectacular lava fountaining events, ranging from strombolian to plinian Deposits of pyroclastic materials are therefore widely disseminated over a large area of Eastern Sicily, with different characteristics in terms of grain size distribution, relative density and mechanical properties. In August 2011 a large amount of volcanic ash was erupted by Mount Etna and fell down, blown by the wind, on the Ionian coast North of the city of Catania. This kind of material is commonly found in the areas surrounding the volcano and, hereafter, is referred to as Due to its highly crushable and compressible nature, the Etna Sand may result problematic from an engineering and construction viewpoint. In fact, even if the soil stress–strain relationships are usually described assuming an invariable grain-size distribution, in many geotechnical engineering applications, crushable soils may experience stresses high enough to break particles of even the strongest soil minerals. This is also relevant in various engineering processes, where crushing related damage and internal instability are consequential (e.g., As an example, it is well known that the large stresses typically involved in pile driving procedures lead to crushing of soil grains, thus affecting the mechanical behavior of piles (e.g., Furthermore, highly stressed soil masses adjacent to, beneath to or located within large and high earth or concrete dams may experience grain crushing and crushing-induced instability transitions could also be relevant for filters (e.g., The mechanical characterization of such a complex natural material, as well as its constitutive modelling, generally involves significant practical and theoretical difficulties and, in the Authors’ knowledge, it was never carried out for the Etna Sand, with appropriate instruments and following a comprehensive experimental programme. From a mechanical point of view, the change in the grain-size distribution may create a more drastic change in the soil internal structure than can be achieved exclusively for a particle rearrangement. Accordingly, the effect of particle crushing on the deformation response of soils should not be neglected (e.g., Based on this background, the relevance and the need of an appropriate experimental programme aimed to achieve an engineering characterization of Etna Sand are evident. It should also be stressed that for this complex natural material a rigorous scientific approach is required to critically analyze the obtained experimental results and to put them in the theoretical framework of soil mechanics and of critical state theory. Accordingly, the paper describes the results of a comprehensive physical and mechanical characterization of Etna Sand. The experimental activities included traditional hand sieving analysis and one-dimensional compression tests and also X-ray diffractometry ( The experimental results are presented and discussed focusing on the effects of particle breakage, examined on the basis of the variation of several size and shape parameters and on the non linearity of the The experimental programme required different equipment including both standard geotechnical testing machines and other devices seldom used for soil testing. In order to analyze the microstructural features and the main constituents of Etna Sand, the material collected during the eruption episode of August 2011 was examined by means of electron scanning microscopy ( SEM–EDS measurements were collected by an ESEM-FEI Inspect-S electron microscope coupled with Oxford INCA PentaFETx3 EDX spectrometer. The spectral data were acquired in ESEM (Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope) and the results were processed by INCA software Energy that uses the XPP matrix correction scheme developed by Pouchou and Pichoir The X-ray powder diffraction analyses were performed at the “Diffractometric laboratory” of Messina University. Data were obtained using a BruKer D8aDVance Diffractometer. Acquisition conditions are 40 One-dimensional compression tests were carried out using a standard oedometer, according to ASTM The oedometer tests were conducted on 38 These tests were carried out on both dry and wet soil specimens prepared at different initial void ratio, using both the original grading of the collected sand and also the damaged material obtained at the end of some tests. Using the same reduced rigid steel ring larger pressure, up to 43 The particle size analyses were carried out using both the traditional hand sieving procedure and the Hand sieving was carried out, according to the standard ASTM The The measure range depends on the dispersing unit and on the sensor. The dispersing unit creates a well dispersed flow of particles that falls through the scanning beam emitted by a pulsed laser. An exposure time of less than 1 The dispersion unit GRADIS/L, suitable for dry pluviation of particles having dimensions in the range 90–3410 The Several size parameters can be evaluated to describe the particle dimensions (  Feret diameters represent a measure of an object size along a specified direction; herein, two different Feret diameters, The results of the dynamic image analysis allow counting the number of particles in a sample and calculating particle size distributions based on either number ( The shape measures obtained through the dynamic image analysis are less subjective than the usual descriptive approach Dynamic image analysis provides also several additional shape parameters: the aspect ratio ( The term ‘sphericity’ is commonly used in the studies concerning dynamic image analysis of soil particles and, accordingly, is used also in the present study. However, it is not a measure of the actual closeness of the particle shape to the spherical shape since the sphericity S is derived from a bi-dimensional (2D) image analysis, where images are projections of the 3D particle shape. X-ray diffractometry allowed recognizing cristobalite and anaorthite as the main constituents of the material. The former is a high-temperature polymorph of silica and is characteristic of the type of eruption from which the material originated. The latter is a ubiquitous mineral in all rocks of Mount Etna.  The physical properties of Etna Sand are summarized in A value However due to the vesicular nature of the sand the specific gravity was evaluated also on fractions with different sizes obtained by sieving. An approximate attempt to evaluate the vesiculation of the material can be carried out calculating the vesiculation index introduced by Houghton and Wilson For irregular particles, as those characterizing the tested material, the measured size depends on both the measuring technique and the definition of the particle size. Thus, particle size analyses were also carried out by using the The dynamic image particle size analysis requires the evaluation of the minimum representative value of the soil mass to be analyzed. This value was calculated by repeating the analysis on specimens characterized by progressively increasing masses. To this purpose three sets of four ( As expected, for all three diameter definitions, differences between the cumulative distribution of each specimen and the mean cumulative distribution reduce with increasing the amount of the tested material; samples having mass 10  The laboratory testing programme consisted of one-dimensional compression tests carried out using the standard oedometer cell and the constant strain rate cell (CRS) equipped with the 38 mm rigid ring. Oedometer specimens were reconstituted at different initial densities, by either pluviation or tamping, and were compressed under wet or dry conditions. The dry weight of each specimen was of about 18–20 Details of the individual tests are given in The initial void ratio of each specimen was calculated from the initial dry weight and initial dimensions of the specimen. The final void ratios were derived from the initial void ratio and the measured volumetric strain. Six tests (ES_OED1-4, ES_OED1d, ES_OED3d) were carried out on specimens created with the initial grading of Etna Sand and reconstituted at different initial void ratios: four tests (ES_OED1-4), up to 16 In order to reach higher vertical stresses, a further one-dimensional compression test (ES_CRS1) was carried out on a dry specimen, characterized by the same initial grading, using the constant strain rate cell. The dry weight of this specimen was of about 15 Finally, two more tests were carried out on dry specimens prepared as loose (DES_OED5) and as dense (DES_OED6) as possible, by using the damaged material previously tested up to 9240 The initial particle size distribution of the damaged material is shown in Hereafter, the data will be provided with reference to the three diameters in order to enable a comprehensive analysis of the effect of diameter definitions on the particle size distributions at the beginning and at the end of the one-dimensional compression tests. Optical microscope images of the original and damaged material used to reconstitute samples of Etna Sand are given in Owing to both the angularity and the surface texture of the original sand grains ( Differences in the initial void ratios can be ascribed to the initial grading and to the textural characteristics of grains. In fact, owing to previous compression, the damaged specimens are less uniform ( The results in terms of void ratio In addition, in According to the qualitative stress level classification by Vesic and Clough The specimens, compressed starting from different initial void ratios, converge at high stresses (about σ′ The reduction in the inclination of the curves at the highest pressures, evident in The possible achievement of the As it is shown in the smaller diagram of Conversely, as a consequence of a lower coordination number, loose specimens (e.g., ES_OED2) experience smoothing of asperities and particle breakage since the very early stages of loading As previously noticed, also in the In The unloading response is always stiff, with a swelling index ( To evaluate the effect of one-dimensional compression on particles crushing of Etna Sand, both particle size and shape were analyzed by using the In Regardless the diameter definition, a widening in the grading curves obtained at the end of tests (final grading in All the final grading curves plotted in Finally, for the specimen DES_OED5, prepared using the damaged material previously tested up to 9240  The same conclusions may be drawn for the initial and final sphericity and convexity distributions referred to both As expected, consistently with the aspect ratio definition ( The effect of particle breakage can be also analyzed comparing the scanning electron micrographs obtained at the beginning and at the end of the one-dimensional compression tests. As an example, To further investigate the effects of crushing on Etna Sand, a series of constant strain rate tests were carried out at vertical pressures ranging in the interval 2.5–45 It can also be observed that curves rotate around a common pivot for σ′  The curves relative to The reduction in particle size implies an increase in the number of particles that is induced by the crushing process. Before testing, specimens are characterized by an average number of particles As an example, the number of particles counted at the end of the tests up to 15 Indeed, with the evolution of the crushing process the capability of the material to break, and then to produce fragments, progressively decreases as the inter-particle contact stresses are distributed over a large number of contacts and the material tends to its comminution limit. Etna Sand is a volcanic ash with grains consisting of angular particles formed by glass shards whose main constituents are cristobalite and anaorthite. It may be classified as a poorly graded sand and may results problematic from an engineering viewpoint due to its compressible and crushable nature. The physical and mechanical characterization of this complex natural material was performed through a comprehensive experimental programme which has included traditional sieving analysis, X-ray diffractometry ( In order to examine the effects of loading on the evolution of the soil micro-structure, oedometer and constant rate of strain compression tests were carried out, up to σ′ The experimental results, examined through a rigorous scientific approach, confirm that the The authors are grateful to prof.
