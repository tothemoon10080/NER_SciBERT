Biohydromet ‘12, sponsored by FLSmidth and ProMine, with media sponsorship by It was attended by 81 delegates representing 22 countries – Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, DR Congo, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Rep. Korea, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, UK and USA. Dr. Chris Bryan, of Curtin University, Australia, and one of the three MEI consultants to this conference, spoke about the history of biohydrometallurgy, from the ideology of the early 80’s, where it was going to revolutionise mining and replace pyrometallurgy completely, to the abrupt dose of reality in Corale Brierley’s Biohydrometallurgy has a poor reputation in certain circles, as a technology that is too unpredictable, but Chris highlighted that it is often used as an avenue of last resort on ores that are untreatable with other methods. It is a complex technology and there is a need for an all-encompassing approach, with fundamental understanding of microbiology, engineering, mineralogy, hydrometallurgy, etc. Personally I felt that the conference came at a time when rapid advances in our understanding of the science of microorganisms has in effect awoken biohydrometallurgy from its long slumber, and it now looks as though it might start to realise its true potential and provide real benefits to the minerals industry. Forty-three papers were presented at the conference, of which 18 have been selected for publication in this special issue. My full report can be found at The 7th symposium,
