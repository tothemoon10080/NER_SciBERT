It was demonstrated that traces of rare earth elements (REEs) can be quantitatively preconcentrated from contaminated water with pH ≥ 3 on a silica-based adsorbent with covalently immobilized amino-di(methylenephosphonic) acid (SiO2-AdPA). However, recovery of REEs from the adsorbent required utilization of a strong mineral acid. In order to reduce environmental impact and increase the reusability of the adsorbent, a ligand-exchange approach that includes treatment of the adsorbent with strong complexing ligands was used. The eluting potential of several ligands was investigated, namely EDTA, 5-sulfosalicylic acid (SSA), citric acid (CiA), aminosulfonic acid (AmSA), α-hydroxyisobutyric acid (HBA), oxalic acid (OxA) and ascorbic acid (AsA). The results were compared to those obtained by acidic treatment (HCl or HNO3). It was demonstrated that the complete desorption of all REEs can be achieved by using 10−2 mol L-1 EDTA solution with pH = 8.0, while acidic treatment requires 1.0 mol L-1 HNO3. Reusability tests demonstrated complete stability of the adsorbent for at least five consecutive adsorption/desorption cycles with no decrease in its adsorption characteristics.Even though lanthanides, scandium, and yttrium belong to the group of the rare-earth elements (REEs) they can no longer be seen as rare. Nowadays REEs are widely used in batteries, computers, cell phones, hard drives, lamps, permanent magnets, drones, aerospace aeronautics, airplanes, bullet trains, hybrid cars, communication systems, cameras and lenses, lasers, speakers, etc., have become strategically important metals [ Liquid-liquid extraction and precipitation strategies that are commonly used for industrial separation and purification in hydrometallurgy are not advantageous for recovery of REEs from e-waste and natural waters since they are not efficient for such objects and produce a large volume of undesirable waste [ Cation- and anion-exchange resins have been commonly used in the early stages of the research for the pre-concentration of REEs from technological solutions [ The drawback of the application of ion exchangers for REEs recovery is their low selectivity and high ion capacity [ Another option for the removal of REEs residuals from natural waters is the application of adsorbents. Various types of adsorbents have been recently suggested for REEs recovery. Among them are low-cost adsorbents produced from agro-waste such as cellulose [ A practical adsorbent shall rapidly adsorb and desorb REEs ions at lower pH levels and demonstrate reusability [ Chelating resins have also been studied for REEs recovery. Among them are styrene-divinylbenzene, divinylbenzene-methacrylate copolymers with immobilized alkylphosphonate [ In recent years organo-mineral composite materials have actively substituted the resins in metal adsorption because of their higher adsorption kinetics and mechanical stability, large surface area and pore volume, lower ion-exchange capacity and better reusability [ The recovery of REEs on the adsorbents very much depends on the solution pH, Eq. The pH of REEs recovery is one of the most important and predominant factors to be considered for the selection of the adsorbent [ At the same time, the ability of the adsorbent to recover REEs from acidic media requires harsh conditions for the desorption of the target ions [ The utilization of strong acids for the desorption of REEs makes chelating adsorbents less attractive for the technology of sustainable recycling. Additionally, organo-mineral adsorbents are not stable at pH < 1 due to acidic hydrolysis of immobilized ligands [ Here we present the results demonstrating the perspective of an alternative approach for desorption of REEs form chelating adsorbents, which does not require high acidity treatment and is based on the principle used in ligand-exchange chromatography [ Therefore, the selection of eluting ligands was based on the values of REEs metal complex stability constants [ Silica gel (40−63 μm particle size, 60 Å), (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (98 %), Phosphorous acid (99 %), Formaldehyde solution (37 wt.% in H A rare-earth element standard solution for ICP analysis, containing 100 mg L Silica gel with covalently immobilized fragments of amino-di(methylene-phosphonic) acid (SiO The BET surface areas of materials were analyzed on ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics Instrument Corp.).
