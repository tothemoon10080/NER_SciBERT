We report on a displaced surgical scapular neck fracture with an ipsilateral undisplaced distal clavicle fracture of the dominant shoulder in a professional athlete. Although directives for determining the treatment of choice, whether conservative or operative, can be found in the literature, confusion still exists. A 22-year-old professional cyclist hit a pole with his right shoulder, when falling with his bicycle at high speed. Conservative treatment with a sling had been initiated in another department. On presentation 3 days later, there was an infected full-thickness skin defect of approximately 30 cm With the collaboration of a plastic surgeon, the skin was thoroughly debrided on the day of admission. A split-thickness skin graft was harvested from the medial side of the opposite upper arm to cover the defect with a mesh graft. The wound healed uneventfully, allowing open reduction and internal fixation of the scapula 10 days later through an approach in the vicinity of the skin lesion. Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the prone position. Through a posterior Scapular neck fractures are rare high-energy injuries, sustained either by a fall on the outstretched arm or by a direct blow to the shoulder. With a direct blow, the force is almost always applied to the front or back of the shoulder and only occasionally to the superior surface. Classical textbooks on traumatology tend to advise conservative treatment for scapular neck fractures, ignoring potential fracture instability and minimizing the clinical implications of a persisting deformity. We advise surgical treatment of surgical neck fractures of the glenoid if a critical displacement occurs, especially in young and high-demand patients. Our method of fixation with mini-fragment instrumentation proved useful in achieving anatomic reduction and stable fixation. Of course, we are unable to define “critical,” agreeing with Egol et al
