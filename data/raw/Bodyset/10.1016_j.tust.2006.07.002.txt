Fires have always been a major problem for underground spaces. As the demand for development of new underground structures increases, safety against fire incidents becomes even more important. This paper examines the design of an emergency ventilation system, which will provide the necessary control of smoke and heated gases within an underground warehouse facility, in case a fire occurs. Due to the pattern of the underground area and the variety of products stored, numerous fire scenarios should be examined in order to secure escape routes in every case, which significantly complicates the problem. For this reason, a different approach has been adopted, matching recent developments in fire safety from tunneling projects and ventilation practices from the mining industry. The ventilation design is based on the “critical velocity” theory; however, alternative configurations of the underground space are simulated by means of mine ventilation software. These alternatives affect the direction and velocity of the airflow and, consequently, the air quantity and the fan power required, in order to secure escape routes during fire emergency. The analysis not only determines the ventilation system characteristics, but also indicates the most appropriate design of the facility, in order to come up with a solution that is both secure and economically acceptable.Subsurface utilization has proven to be a realistic solution and has been gradually gaining ground during the last decades. Literature provides the reasons leading to the development of underground space ( Statistically, underground facilities cannot be considered as major hazardous areas. However, in case of a fire accident, much more severe damage occurs compared to a fire in open air. Aggravating factors include confined space, limited number of escape roads, flashing over and loss of visibility ( fire – and collapse – resistant structures; elimination of combustible materials; detection and alarms; compartmentalization; emergency systems (rescue, escape and refuge); fire and smoke control; and maintenance of safety systems. So far, the measures related to fire fighting in underground spaces (e.g. mines, stations, storage facilities, transportation facilities, etc.) include direct attack with rock dust or water, application of foams or water mist, inertization with nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or exhaust gases from turbine engines and sealing of the affected area. Despite of the wide range of the available fire fighting techniques, it seems that in most cases of large fires the primary concern is the sealing of the fire area ( When a fire occurs, high temperatures (exceeding 1000 This paper presents the design of an emergency ventilation system, which will provide the necessary control of smoke and heated gases within an underground warehouse facility, if a fire occurs. The ventilation system will provide the conditions for emergency evacuation and rescue. The storage facility will be developed using the room-and-pillar mining method. For certain reasons (e.g. the pattern of the underground area, the variety of products stored, etc.) a different approach has been adopted in this research. Due to the large number of the potential fire scenarios involved, the major concern is to prevent “backlayering” phenomenon in order to secure escape routes. Towards this direction, recent developments, adopted by the tunneling fire safety theory, are being utilized and alternative configurations of the underground space are analyzed by means of mine ventilation software. The analysis not only determines the ventilation system characteristics, but also indicates the most appropriate design of the facility, in order to come up with a solution that is both safe and economic. During the last decades, research work and case study analyses have been conducted regarding fires in underground structures and how a proper ventilation system can assist to a safe evacuation procedure. Due to the more intense use of underground space and the changes in technology the study of fire and safety issues has been complicated. In order to deal with the difficulties involved, experiments and large-scale fire tests have been conducted (e.g. In any case, however, simulation programs have the advantage that several fire scenarios can be analysed and visualized, providing a dynamic representation of the fire progress, in terms of the spread of combustion products (e.g. CO) and temperature throughout the underground space. Especially with the increasing power of personal computers, considerable attention has been given towards this direction. Regarding the ventilation system, fire emergency planning involves simulation of the interaction of the fire and the ventilation system. Thus, the ventilation paths, along which hazardous combustion gases pass through, are determined in order to design safe escape routes and fire fighting activities. This procedure provides useful results for decision-making, in case the underground space pattern is relatively simple and potential fire hazards are limited (e.g. maintenance shops and fuel bays). Dealing, however, with underground storage facilities, i.e. warehouses, the calculation of smoke propagation under different fire scenarios becomes practically impossible, due to the complex layout of the facility and the numerous potential locations of the fire. To overcome this problem, the procedure presented utilizes the “critical velocity” theory and passive fire protection measures (e.g. fire safety departments) so as to establish the air quantity required in every single point of the underground space. Further, different layouts of the underground facility are examined to minimize fan horsepower. The design of an appropriate ventilation system for underground structures, in general, must take into consideration, mainly, two issues: The supply of the necessary air flow rate that provides adequate ventilation under normal conditions. The smoke and high temperatures management in case of a fire emergency, to establish safe evacuation conditions. According to the methodology presented, the design steps of the ventilation system, for both normal and emergency operation, are: Estimation of the required quantity of the incoming air under normal operating conditions. Determination of the critical air velocity for each branch to control smoke propagation. Air velocity lower than the critical can be considered inadequate, whereas larger than the critical velocity could result in possible increase of the fire size and contribute to its rapid spread throughout the area. Estimation of the required quantity of the total incoming air in order to attain critical velocity and avoid “backlayering”. Configuration of the facility layout alternatives, so as to minimize air quantity requirements. Re-estimation of the required air quantity for each alternative. Selection of the final scheme. All underground facilities, except from small tunnels, require the application of a ventilation system to dilute the contaminants produced by vehicle engines during normal operation, such that a complete air exchange is succeeded within a reasonable time frame ( The standard procedure consists of blowing the whole smoke towards a specific exit, while avoiding the occurrence of backlayering ( critical air velocity (m/s); average temperature of fire site gases (K); 0.606 or 0.61; grade factor; tunnel grade (%); acceleration caused by gravity (9.81 height of tunnel at the fire site (m); heat release rate (kW); average air density (1.2 specific heat of air (1.1 area perpendicular to the flow (m temperature of fresh air (K). Most recommendations for tunnel ventilation system operation concern themselves mainly with control and extraction of smoke in the event of a fire. The heat release rate (HRR) of a fire, which is generally expressed in MW, is considered to be an important factor contributing to the severity of a fire and a good measure of its size. The study under investigation involves an underground structure excavated using the room and pillar mining method. It includes one entrance and one exit. Fresh air enters the warehouse by a 50 The storage system of such a warehouse is given by In the case of underground storage facilities, air requirements are usually diminished. According to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62-2001 about ventilation for acceptable indoor quality, an air entrainment rate of 0.3 The critical air velocity and temperature in relation with the heat release rate in case of a fire in a corridor are presented in the diagrams of         In order to obtain the fire simulation and the analysis of different layout scenarios, the estimation of the heat release rate is essential. Because of the variety of the potential storing products, there are many uncertainties regarding this factor. In many similar cases the worst-case scenario is chosen, but this leads to conservative results. In the case studied, the use of probabilistic modeling using Monte-Carlo simulation is decided in order to achieve more accurate results. The definition of the statistical distribution describing a parameter behavior is used in order to proceed with the probabilistic modeling. In this case, a triangular distribution is chosen to model the heat release rate behavior, based on the analysis of the literature data. Furthermore, it is chosen because the research is at an initial stage with no specific data regarding the products which are to be stored inside the warehouse. Knowing the exact usage of the warehouse can change the selection of distribution to a more representative having in mind the heat release rate and stored quantity of each product so as to have more accurate rather than indicative results. The triangular distribution is a continuous probability distribution typically used as a subjective description of a population for which there is only limited sample data. It is based on knowledge of the minimum and maximum and an inspired guess as to what the modal value might be. The parameters for the triangular distribution are minimum, maximum, and most probable, which falls between the minimum and maximum values. Hence, a triangular shaped distribution is formed, which shows that values near the minimum and maximum are less likely to occur than those near the most probable one. Despite being a simplistic description of a population, it is a very useful distribution for modeling processes where the relationship between variables is known, but data is scarce ( The “Crystal Ball” software was used in order to apply the probabilistic modeling and values 1 The simulation results are given for the emergency scenario only, for reasons of conciseness. Simulations are carried out by means of VnetPC 2003 software, which is briefly described hereinafter. (a) VnetPC is a program of the Mine Ventilation Services Inc. that simulates mine ventilation networks. The applicability of VnetPC to subsurface ventilation system design ranges from the initial concept to the system operation phase of a project. Given information that describes the geometry of a ventilation network, airway resistances or dimensions, and the locations and characteristic curves of fans, the code produces listings and visual graphics of many parameters including predicted airflows, frictional pressure drops, air power losses in airways, and fan operating points, using the fundamental equations airway resistance (N pressure drop (Pa); flow rate (m friction factor (kg/m length of airway (m); equivalent length of shock loss (m); perimeter of airway (m); cross-section of airway (m A ventilation network is a graphical representation of a ventilation system and consists of a set of junctions and interconnecting lines (branches), which denote major or significant airflow routes. The model of the examined area consists of 30 branches and 21 junctions with one fun. Values of friction factor and equivalent lengths are selected by tables given in the literature ( (b) The primary requirements for the emergency ventilation systems are derived from smoke control considerations, i.e. the smoke can always be driven in the required direction without any significant backlayering ( According to the first scenario, the area was left as it was excavated with the room and pillar pattern, without any modification. Fresh air entering the area is distributed to the three longitudinal corridors ( The second scenario is based on the tunnel cross-passages theory ( According to the third scenario, stoppings are installed to all the cross-cuts in order to split the area into three independent airways ( More specific, this scenario is based on the controlled split of the entrained airflow to the three longitudinal airways, so as to achieve air supply rates of 135 During the last years, there has been a lot of research regarding fires in underground areas and emergency ventilation systems. These cases refer mainly to transportation tunnels, where the critical velocity theory is applied, and fire events in mines, where the problem is examined through the arrangement of the airflow direction. So far, there is a gap in the literature concerning subsurface storage facilities. The paper examines a special case of an underground warehouse center, which is constructed using a classic mining method, namely room-and-pillar. The analysis tries to bridge this gap by developing ideas adopted from cases met in both tunnel and mine-fire events. In general, the installation of a proper ventilation system in combination with the existence of an evacuation plan could be sufficient in order to safely evacuate an underground area in case of a fire, leaving certain airways free of smoke. Towards this direction, fire simulation software has been proven to be a quite useful tool for fire and safety officials. Fire scenarios can be analyzed and personnel can be trained to contend such an emergency. In the case studied, due to the large number of the potential fire scenarios involved, the analysis follows a different approach, dealing not only with the influence of the ventilation system, but also the outline of the underground space. In addition, Monte-Carlo modeling simulation was used to address the uncertainty of the products stored in the warehouse, covering a number of different situations (heat release rates). The requirement for critical airflow in every airway of the area is proved to be not attainable, since enormous air quantities would be required. Towards this direction, alternative configurations of the underground space are analyzed by means of mine ventilation software. The compartmentalization of the area, by installing stoppings and the partition of the warehouse into three parallel corridors, seems to be the most efficient solution. In addition, the installation of regulators is necessary in order to optimize the ventilation system performance. The analysis proved that the control of smoke flow is achieved at any area of the underground structure and safe evacuation is obtained. Hence, the results not only indicate the proper ventilation system characteristics, but also provide the most suitable design of the facility. The approach presented is less complicated and can be easily applied compared to CFD simulations. Due to the pattern of the underground area and the variety of products stored, numerous fire scenarios should be examined in order to secure escape routes in every case, a fact that would significantly have complicated the analysis. Of course, in some cases (e.g. very large underground facilities) the approach proposed may be unfeasible, due to the high investment costs required for achieving critical airflow velocities in each corridor. According to the analysis, the requirements for air supply during normal operation are minimal. This demand could be covered via natural ventilation or the temporary operation of a fan. Nevertheless, the design of the emergency ventilation system is crucial, as fresh air requirements are significant. For this reason, emergency ventilation system should be a part of the overall study of the project, as it interacts with the number and the form of the access works as well as the internal layout of the underground facility.
