Coals that are produced in excess of demand have to be deposited in stockpiles. Spontaneous combustion phenomenon can take place in these stockpiles when convenient conditions are available. In this work, some of the parameters that are effective on the temperature of the stockpiles were measured. Additionally, the size of the coal piles formed on an industrial scale and the equipment used to take temperature measurements are given in detail. Finally, a model developed by the utilization of the statistical analysis technique for Tuncbilek coals was introduced. This model offers an estimation of temperature change behaviour for the coals in stockyards to a high level of accuracy.Although many studies in the laboratory have been carried out on Tuncbilek coals, a direct detailed study on stockpiles has not yet been made. The laboratory studies are carried out on coals in gram degrees and the effect of limited parameters on the event can be examined only in the available conditions of experiment. For that reason the experimental studies in laboratories for coals spontaneously combusting is very difficult to be examined as a whole and extrapolating the results into practice is also difficult. An industrial sized study including the most of the effective parameters on spontaneous combustion is important especially to determine the general behaviour of coal while spontaneously combusting. However, the number of these studies undertaken is very few because the tests are lengthy and are also enormously expensive. Similar works from the literature are small in number The coal stockpile in which the experiments were undertaken was at coal stockyard of Western Lignite Corporation (WLC) in Tuncbilek ( The size of the stockyard pile was about 10 A computer system was used to record the heat data received from 22 sensors (Pt100) and the information saved on to a data base. The schematic presentations of these sensors are seen in The program used to receive the data measured automatically was written in Delphi 3.0 The measured raw data were filtered by Excel program using the method of moving average filter A regression analysis was undertaken on the filtered timing values obtained from the application area. In the first level of this study, a regression analysis was carried out to determine the five parameters affecting the sensors in the stockpile. Using the regression analysis, linear, exponential and logarithmic functions were analyzed and it was found that the values of the correlation coefficient were very low. However, with polynomial functions, it was shown that the values of correlation coefficient were high. Therefore, it was decided to use the polynomial function in this study. A search for a statistical model to cover all the parameters for the stockpile was made. Thus, the statistic software called SPSS 9.0 The temperature measurements received from the pile were directly proportional with the time. The temperature measurements received from the pile were directly proportional with the air temperature. An inverse proportion was observed between the air temperature and the air moisture. An inverse proportion was observed between the air temperature and the atmospheric pressure. It was also observed that the statistical model formed according to these determinations gave the most acceptable values. The statistical model obtained is presented below:        Coefficients=( The graph for In the multi-regression equations, there is only one constant and more than one slope. Therefore, when trying to determine the correlation coefficient for multi-regression equations, it is possible to calculate more than one correlation coefficient. However, it is difficult to decide how much the regression equations with more correlation coefficients explain the observed values. For this reason, the certainty coefficient is used to understand whether the multiple regression equation can explain the observed values. If the value of certainty coefficient is greater than 0.5, it is said that there is a meaningful relationship Coals produced in excess of demand have to be stored in the stockyards at collieries. During this period, coals lose both their economical values and cause environmental problems. In this work, some parameters thought to be effective on the stockpiles of coals have been examined. A total of 459.171 data of temperature were received from the stockyard pile used in the experimental work. Then these raw data were filtered and the frequency interval of measurements was increased to hourly interval. By the assistance of the parameters effective on the stockpiles, multi-regression analysis was undertaken and the relation given in Eq. It was also observed that an accumulation of heat did not occur in the stockpile used in the test work. This was due to the heat finding a way out of the pile. By utilising this model, an estimation of temperature changes for the coals kept in stockyards can be made to an acceptable level of accuracy which is thought to be useful for the mine management.
