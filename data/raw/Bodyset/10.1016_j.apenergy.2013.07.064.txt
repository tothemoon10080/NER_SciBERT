Mineral carbonation technologies aim at permanently storing CO2 into materials rich in metal oxides. A multi-step mineralization process employing Ca-rich waste streams to precipitate calcium carbonate is investigated in this paper. Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), phosphorus slag (PS) and steel slag (SS) were employed as feeding materials for the process. Solid to liquid ratio (S/L) is an important factor which affects mineral carbonation and this study examines its effect on the carbonation efficiencies. The main phases present in the carbonated residues were identified using XRF, XRD and SEM–EDS analytical techniques. For the three materials investigated, the carbonation efficiency increased when the S/L ratio decreased (from 50g/L to 25g/L and then 15g/L) because of the dilution effect. In a previous study, where an analog process was employed, efficiency using serpentine was found lower than that calculated here for GGBS and SS, and slightly above PS. This confirms that, in general, waste materials require less energy-intensive carbonation conditions, in comparison to mineral rocks. Finally, the structure of the carbonated particles is also discussed.Nowadays fossil fuels account for 80–85% of the total of world energy use and they cause the release of about 30 Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is a portfolio of technologies aiming to capture the CO At ambient conditions, the gas–solid mineralization reaction takes place on geological time-scales and, therefore, research has focused on developing different technologies to speed up the process This paper focuses on using a process similar to that previously developed for magnesium-rich serpentine minerals by Wang and Maroto-Valer The overall process utilizes ammonium bisulfate (NH Furthermore, solid-to-liquid (S/L) ratio is an important parameter which has been shown to affect significantly the efficiency of mineralization of serpentines The three feedstock materials, namely, SS, GGBS and PS employed for this study were obtained from production plants of steel, iron and phosphorus respectively where a representative amount of 5 SS, GGBS and PS were characterized employing different techniques to assess the parameters important for mineral carbonation. The loss on ignition (LOI) was determined gravimetrically by taking ∼1 Characterization of the crystalline mineral phases present in SS, PS and GGBS was achieved using a Hiltonbrooks X-ray Diffractometer (XRD) using a 3 This paper focuses on the dissolution, adjustment of pH and carbonation steps of the overall close-loop mineralization process ( Following the procedure developed by Wang and Maroto-Valer The solutions employed were prepared with stochiometric NH The carbonation step was also carried out employing stoichiometric (NH After each of the mineral carbonation experiments, the solution was filtered and the solid residues dried in an oven at 105 The efficiency of carbonation was calculated as: Because the waste streams suitable for mineral carbonation and studied in this paper are rich in CaO, the efficiency of carbonation has been calculated considering only the conversion of CaO into CaCO The oxide composition of solid residues for each product was determined using XRF and XRD following the methodology described in Section XRF studies were conducted on the parent samples to determine the major oxides present and the results are reported in The LOI value for the SS sample is higher than that of the GGBS and PS samples. This can be attributed to the decomposition of CaCO  TGA tests were carried out on the carbonated solid residues obtained after the experiments on SS, PS and GGBS samples using three different S/L ratios (15–25–50 Mineralization of waste materials, in general, requires less energy-intensive carbonation conditions, in comparison to mineral rocks Results from XRF analyses obtained from the carbonated residues are presented in The solid residues from the carbonation step were analyzed by XRD and SEM–EDS studies of the final solid residues obtained after experiments at 15 Representative images obtained from the PS carbonated residue at 15 Following the characterization studies conducted using SEM–EDS, supported by XRD and XRF, the structure of the carbonated particles is discussed here. As the mineralization process consists of several consecutive steps (dissolution, pH adjustment and carbonation, The mineralization process developed by Wang and Maroto-Valer using serpentine reported that the rate limiting step of the dissolution reaction was the formation of a product layer of silica during the extraction of magnesium from serpentine In this paper, a multi-step mineralization process was studied using three different waste materials (SS, PS and GGBS). The three samples have a high content of CaO (38%, 47% and 39% for SS, PS and GGBS, respectively) and, therefore, they have a good predisposition for mineral carbonation. XRD analyses showed that the mineral phases present in the parent materials were crystalline phases containing CaO for SS and PS while GGBS was mainly amorphous. The multi-step mineral carbonation process was investigated using three different S/L ratio (15–25–50 The structure of the carbonated particles was also discussed. Silica from the raw samples did not dissolve and formed the particle core.
