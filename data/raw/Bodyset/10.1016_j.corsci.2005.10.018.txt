Chromium passivation and lacquering are typically used to improve the corrosion resistance of tinplate in packed food. In this work, the nature of the chromium passivation layer formed during dip or CDC passivation treatments, as a function of operational parameters, and its influence on lacquer adhesion, was investigated using electrochemical polarisation, XPS, Auger and lacquer peel-off tests. It was found that dip passivated tinplate provide the best lacquer adhesion, and that the adhesion on CDC treated tinplate could be improved by buffering or lowering the pH of the chromium (VI) solution.The relatively active tin surface produced by electroplating and flow melting of tinplate is typically passivated in a dilute sodium dichromate solution by means of either a dip process yielding 1–3 It is generally accepted In the present work, the nature of the surface species formed during passivation treatments was investigated using electrochemical polarisation tests and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), while the strength of adhesion of an epoxy phenolic lacquer to the passivated tinplate surface was evaluated using modified T-peel tests. Passivation of tin surfaces were performed on production as well as laboratory prepared samples. To ensure repeatability of the test results, the production samples were sourced from the same production runs for the dip and CDC treatments, respectively. Both the dip and CDC passivation treatments were done using an electrolyte containing 25 The effect of pH and buffering of the sodium dichromate solution on the passivation treatment were investigated by adjusting the pH of the solution to 1.4 with chromic acid and to 6.4 using caustic soda, and by the addition of a solution containing 80 parts acetic acid to 20 parts sodium acetate, to obtain concentrations of 0.2 and 0.5 Potentiodynamic polarisation tests were performed with the aid of a Solartron electrochemical interface, model 1286, using a conventional three electrode set-up with an external Ag/AgCl reference electrode connected to the cell through a luggin tube filled with saturated KCl, and a platinum counter electrode. A phosphate solution buffered at pH 7.4, containing 1.6 The X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) used was a Physical Electronics model 5400 equipped with both an Al/Mg dual X-ray source and an Al monochromator. The instrument was operated at a base pressure of less than 4 A Perkin–Elmer PHI 600 auger electron spectrometer (AES) instrument, equipped with a lanthanum hexaboride (LaB An epoxy phenolic lacquer (Valspar, MBCN 5445), typically used for lacquering the inside of three-piece cans, was used. The lacquer was applied by means of a bar coater to a coating mass of 30–60 The relative adhesion of the lacquer to differentially treated tinplate samples was evaluated by gluing the two specimens together, using Henkel Macroplast The potentiodynamic polarisation diagrams for the dip and CDC treated tinplate surfaces are shown in Exploration of this shift in breakdown potential was done by investigating the solubility of the different chromium species in caustic solutions. Previous research The XPS survey results for the dip and CDC passivated tinplate, shown in Angle resolved XPS analyses of the Sn 3d and Cr 2p peaks on CDC passivated tinplate, shown in Multiplex analyses of the Sn 3d peaks for dip and CDC passivated tinplate, respectively, shown in The multiplex analyses of the Cr 2p peaks for the dip and CDC passivated tinplate, shown in The polarisation diagrams obtained for laboratory samples, CDC passivated with dichromate solutions of different pH values, are shown in The results for the buffered solutions, shown in The main difference between surface species for dip and CDC treated tinplate is the additional SnO and Cr(OH) The location of the failure of the lacquer on the tinplate was further investigated using AES analyses. The presence of chromium on the surface of a CDC treated tinplate sample is indicated by the peaks at 531 and 572 The nature of the chromium species deposited on tinplate during passivation treatments is dependent on the surface pH, with more highly hydrated chromium (III) oxide forming at higher pH values, such as those generated during cathodic polarisation of the tinplate surface. The presence of more hydrated chromium species on tinplate, cause weaker bonding of stoved lacquer to the tinplate surface. The negative effect of the hydrated chromium species, formed during CDC passivation treatments, can be countered by decreasing the pH and by buffering the chromium passivation solution used for the passivation treatment. The use of a dip passivation treatment improves the stoved lacquer adhesion, but is not protective enough for use with more corrosive food.
