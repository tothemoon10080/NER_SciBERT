The authors appreciate the Discussion comments by Dr. Göktan and his interest in the new ISRM Suggested Method. As is known, the Shore Hardness (SH), as one of the physical properties of rocks, is widely employed to describe the hardness of rocks and the testing procedure requires that at least 20 measurements should be implemented at different points on the testing surface of the sample. Rocks are composed of a matrix with grains of the kind or of different minerals and a bonding material. Therefore, SH measurements even on the same surface of a rock sample may give different results if the rock consists of different minerals. This plays a significant role, as stated by Dr. Göktan, in the determination of the SH values. In addition, mineral grain size, degree of cementing, rock density, porosity, etc. also influence SH measurements. However, the objective of the study conducted by Altindag and Güney Dr. Göktan has stated in his Discussion that the rocks tested in The variations in SH values with sample volume are illustrated in In conclusion, results of this supplemantary study support the ISRM Suggested Method prepared by Altindag and Güney so that the critical (minimum) sample volume for consistent SH values of rocks is valid at 80
