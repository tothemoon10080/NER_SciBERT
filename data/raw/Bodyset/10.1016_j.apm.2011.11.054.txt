The 3D approach was employed for investigations of the symmetric local stability loss of the circular hollow cylinder made from the viscoelastic composite materials. This approach is based on investigations of the development of the initial rotationally symmetric infinitesimal local imperfections of the circular hollow cylinder within the scope of 3D geometrically nonlinear field equations of the theory of viscoelasticity for anisotropic bodies. The numerical results of the critical force and critical time are presented and discussed. For comparison and estimation of the accuracy of the results given by the 3D approach, the same problem is also solved by using various approximate shell theories. The viscoelasticity properties of the plate material are described by the fractional–exponential operator. The numerical results and their discussion are presented for the case where the cylinder is made of a uni-directional fibrous viscoelastic composite material. In particular, it is established that the difference between the critical times obtained by employing 3D and third order refined shell theories becomes more non-negligible if the values of the external compressive force are close to the critical compressive force which is obtained at t
                     =∞ (t denotes a time).Investigations into stability loss problems of the elements of construction from composite materials in many cases require the application of the Three-Dimensional Linearized Theory of Stability (TDLTS), the equations and relations of which are obtained from the exact non-linear equations of the deformable solid body mechanics by employing the linearization procedure similarly used in papers Note that from the historical aspect, the equations of TDLTS were first obtained in a paper The very reliable and frequently used approach for the investigation of the stability loss of the elements of constructions made from time dependent materials is the approach proposed in An extension of the foregoing three-dimensional (3D) approach for investigation of the stability loss problems of the elements of constructions made from linear viscoelastic composite materials was the subject of the papers The foregoing completes a brief review of all investigations carried out up to now within the scope of the TDLTS and related to the elements of constructions made from viscoelastic composite materials. It should be noted that in the papers mentioned above the corresponding results obtained by the approximate plate theories based on the Kirchhoff–Love and Kromm However, as follows from the foregoing discussion, all the studies noted above relate to 3D stability loss of the viscoelastic composite plate. Consequently, there is no investigation related to the three-dimensional stability loss problem of the viscoelastic cylinder which is also used in a lot of elements of constructions. In the present paper, the first attempt in this field is undertaken and the approach proposed in the paper We consider a hollow cylinder which has an initial rotationally symmetric infinitesimal imperfection in the natural state and determine the position of the points of this cylinder with the Lagrange coordinates in the cylindrical We assume that the thickness of the cylinder’s wall is constant along the cylinder and is equal to This investigation is made within the scope of the following field equations: The constitutive relations for the cylinder material in the cylindrical system of coordinates are given as follows: Denoting the inner and outer surface of the hollow cylinder by Moreover, we assume that at the ends of the cylinder the conditions written below are satisfied: Thus, the formulation of the considered problem has been exhausted and it follows that the evolution of the infinitesimal initial imperfection of the fiber with time for the fixed value of the external compressed force Now we consider the method of solution for the problem formulated in the previous section. Note that the method employed below can be briefly summarized as follows. By employing the boundary-form perturbation techniques, the considered boundary value problem for the non-linear integro-differential Eqs. According to the procedure summarized above and the problem statement, first we derive the equation for the inner and outer lateral surfaces According to the procedures of the boundary perturbation technique, as in the works Now we consider determination of the values related to the first approximation. Taking the expression Substituting these solutions into relations Thus, with the foregoing, we determine completely the Laplace transforms of the values related to the first approximation. The Laplace transform of the values of the second and subsequent approximations in The original of the south values is determined by employing the method by Schapery For the case under consideration, the approximate stability loss equations for the hollow cylinder-shell can be derived from equations Eqs. If we replace the term Now we turn to the solution of the Eq. Employing the Schapery method In the general case, i.e. in the case where the cylinder material is viscoelastic transversal isotropic, the values of the critical parameters, according to As for the third order refined shell theory, we use the same modification of the theory by Kromm As in the previous subsection, multiplying the first equation in We assume that the cylinder is made from viscoelastic unidirectional fibrous composite material and its fibers lie along the We introduce the dimensionless rheological parameter We assume that According to We compare the results obtained within the scope of the TDLTS with the corresponding ones obtained within the scope of the Kirchhoff–Love shell theory and within the scope of the third order refined shell theory. Through Thus, for the problem under consideration we have the dimensionless parameters Note that the parameter It follows from the foregoing numerical results that the relations: Now we consider the case where the cylinder material is viscoelastic and analyze the critical time. To compare the values of the critical time given by TDLTS with those given by approximate shell theories we must select the values of For a clearer illustration of the difference between the Recall that the results illustrated in Now we consider the question of how the rheological parameter Compare the values of Thus, in the present paper within the scope of the three-dimensional geometrically non-linear field equations of the theory for viscoelastic transversal isotropic bodies, an approach has been developed for the 3D symmetric stability loss analyses of the hollow cylinder made from viscoelastic composite material. It is supposed that the cylinder has an initial infinitesimal symmetry with respect to the axis of the cylinder imperfection and, as the critical time for viscoelastic problems, a time for which this infinitesimal imperfection starts to increase and grow indefinitely is taken. To study the corresponding non-linear boundary value problem, the boundary-form disturbance method and small parameter method are employed simultaneously. As a result of these applications, the solution to the mentioned non-linear problem is reduced to the solution of the corresponding series linear problems. By direct verification it is proven that the equations and relations related to the first and subsequent approximations coincide with the equations and relations of the well known TDLTS. Based on the previous work of the first author it is noted that for investigation of the stability loss problem it is enough to use only the zeroth and first approximations. By the average-integrating procedure the corresponding approximate stability loss equations within the scope of the Kirchhoff–Love and third order refined shell theories are derived from the equations and relations of the mentioned first approximations. Final numerical results are obtained by employing Laplace transform and variation separation methods for the case where the cylinder is made from a viscoelastic composite consisting of the viscoelastic matrix and unidirectional elastic fibers lying along the cylinder. At first, the numerical results related to the pure elastic stability loss of the cylinder at
