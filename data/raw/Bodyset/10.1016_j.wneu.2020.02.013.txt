Objective
                  To determine whether Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score (TLICS) and the Thoracolumbar AOSpine Injury Score (TL AOSIS) have any superiority to each other in terms of the reliability of their recommendations for guiding the treatment strategy of thoracolumbar spine injuries.
               
                  Methods
                  A total of 110 consecutive patients with thoracolumbar injuries hospitalized from January to September 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. The TLICS and the TL AOSIS systems were compared based on patients' therapeutic decisions suggested by each system.
               
                  Results
                  A total of 110 patients were studied. The TL AOSIS matched treatment decision-making in 108 patients (98.18%), and the TLICS matched 96 patients (87.27%). Of the patients without neurologic deficit, according to TL AOSIS system, 12 of 62 received >5 points, 12 received 4 or 5 points, and 38 received <4 points. According to TLICS system, 12 of 62 received ≥5 points, 50 received ≤3 points, and none received 4 points. The TL AOSIS matched 60 patients (96.77%), and the TLICS matched 48 patients (77.42%). Of the patients with neurologic deficits, according to TL AOSIS system, 36 of 48 received >5 points, and 12 received 4 or 5 points. According to TLICS system, 22 received >4 points, and 26 received 4 points, and the systems achieved agreement.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Recommendations of TL AOSIS might be more reliable than those of TLICS particularly for guiding the surgical management of complete burst fractures.Thoracolumbar fracture is the most common type of spinal injuries in clinic. The first AO classification of thoracolumbar injuries was reported by Magerl et al. The TLICS published by Vaccaro et al. At present, there are no clear data in the literature regarding the superiority of the classification systems for thoracolumbar fractures. For this reason, we compared the TLICS and TL AOSIS systems, and intended to determine whether TLICS and TL AOSIS have any superiority to each other in terms of the reliability of their recommendations for guiding the treatment strategy of thoracolumbar spine injuries. A total of 110 consecutive patients with thoracolumbar injuries hospitalized from January to September 2019 with complete preoperative imaging data were retrospectively analyzed, including 68 men and 42 women, aged 21–68 years (37.5 ± 5.7 years). The complete preoperative imaging data included x-ray, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracolumbar spine. Anterior and lateral x-ray, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging were analyzed to identify the morphology of the injured vertebrae. According to the references, T1-weighted, T2-weighted, T1-weighted fat suppression, T2-weighted fat suppression, and short-time inversion recovery image were analyzed to evaluate the PLC injury. To make sure the classification of the included cases was accurate, patient injuries were classified by 5 experienced surgeons. The TL AOSIS includes 3 major variables: fracture pattern, neurologic status, and patient-specific modifiers, with a full score of 10. Injuries with a TL AOSIS of ≤3 should undergo a trail of conservative treatment, and injuries with a TL AOSIS of >5 would carry a recommendation for surgical intervention. Both operative or nonoperative treatment is appropriate for injuries with a TL AOSIS of 4 or 5 ( Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software version 20.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York, USA). The χ A total of 110 patients were studied. According to the TL AOSIS system, 38 patients received <4 points, 48 patients received >4 points, and 24 patients received 4 or 5 points. Of the patients without neurologic deficit, 12 of 62 received >5 points, 12 received 4 or 5 points, and 38 received <4 points. Of the patients with neurologic deficits, 36 of 48 received >5 points, 12 received 4 or 5 points, and none received <4 points. The TLICS score was <4 points in 50 patients, 4 points in 26 patients, and >4 points in 34 patients. Of the 62 patients without neurologic deficit, 12 received >4 points, and 50 received <4 points ( In our series, of the 110 patients, 74 underwent surgical treatment and 36 underwent conservative treatment. All A4 type fractures and 2 severe A3 fractures were treated surgically because of concerns regarding fracture comminution and the possibility of progressive kyphosis deformity. The TL AOSIS matched treatment decision-making in 108 patients (98.18%), and the TLICS matched 96 patients (87.27%). Subgroup analysis was conducted according to the preoperative neurologic status of patients. In the neurologically intact group, TL AOSIS matched 60 patients (96.77%), and TLICS matched 48 patients (77.42%). In the neurologic deficit group, all patients were treated surgically, and the 2 systems achieved agreement ( Various spinal injury classification and scoring systems have been proposed to help surgeons make reliable therapeutic decisions. The TLICS system was the first surgical strategy guiding scoring system described by Vaccaro et al., Our study shows that 2 classification systems have achieved agreement in treatment recommendations for most patients with thoracolumbar injuries. However, it should be noted that in the group without neurologic deficit, 12 patients received 4–5 points of the TL AOSIS, whereas those patients all received <4 points of the TLICS, and a trial of conservative treatment was recommended by the TLICS ( However, in the neurologic deficit group, 36 patients received >5 points of the TL AOSIS and would undergo a surgical treatment according to the TL AOSIS suggestion, whereas only 22 patients received surgical advice according to the TLICS system ( Compared with the TLICS, the TL AOSIS recommendation matched treatment decision-making in more patients (108 vs. 96, 98.18% vs. 87.27%; Recommendations of the TL AOSIS might be more reliable than those of the TLICS particularly for guiding the surgical management of complete burst fractures. However, it is still difficult to reach definite conclusions regarding the superiority of the TL AOSIS because the debate regarding the ideal classification system is ongoing. Furthermore, the efficacy of the classification systems need to be proved with further multicenter prospective studies.
