The presence of Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat meat products is cause of concern to the food industry as well as to health authorities. Studies were conducted to evaluate the presence of L. monocytogenes in mortadellas acquired at retail stores and to evaluate the fate of two levels of a L. monocytogenes pool spiked in two different formulations of the product, cooked under commercial conditions and stored at refrigeration (7°C) and room temperature (25°C). Among the samples collected at different retail stores, 26.7% harboured L. monocytogenes. Regarding to the fate of L. monocytogenes in mortadella, periodically, samples were taken and the surviving L. monocytogenes cells in the spiked products were counted by the MPN procedure. Populations of <0.35 MPN/g of L. monocytogenes were found in these samples. It could be concluded that the heat treatment was effective to reduce 3-log of L. monocytogenes independent of formulation or storage conditions. According to Ready-to-eat meat products have been implicated as a cause of listeriosis in different countries ( The incidence of Several hypotheses can be formulated to explain this contamination, such as survival of There have been a number of reports on the fate of Thirty samples of mortadella belonging to five brands were acquired at five different retail stores in Sao Paulo, S.P., Brazil. Each sample weighed 300 g. They were analysed for Analytical units of 25 g of mortadella were homogenized with 225 ml of Five different strains of Two formulations of mortadella were prepared: 1-POP: 12% beef; 8.5% pork trimmings; 5% pork fat; 10% by-product meat; 20% mechanically separated chicken meat; 16% lard cubes; 10% textured soy protein; 5% starch; curing agents [2.6% sodium chloride (w/w); 200 mg/kg sodium nitrite], spices (mixture of black pepper, nutmeg and cummin); and 2-TOP: 35% beef; 30% pork trimmings; 3.4% pork fat, 16% lard cubes; 2% starch; curing agents [2.6% NaCl (w/w); 200 mg/kg NaNO Samples for analysis were taken immediately after stuffing (initial), after cooking ( Immediately after stuffing the cases, three raw mortadellas of each type (TOP+high inoculum; TOP+low inoculum; POP+high inoculum; POP+low inoculum) were collected and used to enumerate initial At each sampling day ( To determine Water activity ( Analysis of variance and Tukey Test were used to determine statistical differences between average of measurements of water activity and most probable number of The statistical analyses were done using STATISTICA for Windows Release 5.0A (Statsoft Inc. Tulsa, OK, USA). The first part of this study showed a high frequency of This frequency is higher than those found by others ( The second part of this study was conducted under commercial manufacturing conditions using a pool of five Two levels of contamination were used, one low (10  As can be seen, no Several authors have reported the influence of fat and/or curing salts on the heat resistance of Since low numbers (<0.3 MPN/g) of It can be concluded that the 3 log reduction in The authors would like to thank FAPESP for Bersot's fellowship and Dr. J. Farber for supplying some strains of
