Modern techniques allow for high rates of union in the treatment of diaphyseal forearm fractures. In the case of nonunion, addressing the biology and stability of the fracture will similarly yield high union rates, but slightly decreased functional outcomes. Malunion of forearm fractures typically results in loss of range of motion and grip strength. Restoration of the anatomical relationships of the forearm yields functional results. Understanding and recreating the anatomy of the forearm is the key to obtaining good functional outcomes.
