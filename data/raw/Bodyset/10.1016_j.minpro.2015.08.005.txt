The aim of this investigation was to establish the optimal processing parameters of the comminuted phosphate grain mixture mechanical treatment by monitoring and evaluating the activated product characteristics. An ultra-centrifugal mill with a peripheral comminuting path was used as activator in the experiment. A mathematical model based on the theoretical principles of the grain mixture mechanical processing was applied in order to characterize the phosphate activation procedure. As the energy conversion that takes place by the interaction mill–material during activation is recorded on the processed phosphate grains, the increase in potential energy of the activated grains was measured by means of an automatic grain counter. Following the operating hypothesis of the automatic grain counter, the energy conversion and the properties of phosphate grains induced by mechanical force were monitored and expressed in the form of the grain inertia change. The phosphate ore grain mixture used in the experiment was thoroughly analyzed, particularly in its activated state. Analytically obtained results were supported by X-ray diffraction analysis for identification of crystalline phases and change in crystallinity, and SEM microphotography of initial and activated phosphate grains. Diverse comparison analyses disclosed that the optimal set of activation process parameters could reduce the negative effect of phosphate sample immanent properties on the final score and furthermore enhance the material reactivity.Phosphate minerals, which are obtained from the phosphate rocks via various refining procedures, represent an essential basic material for different applications: industry of ceramic materials and anti-corrosion agents, as well as metallurgy ( Phosphate rocks are mineralogically complex as they usually contain one or more phosphate minerals. The mineral which is the most suitable for commercial utilization is fluorapatite (3Ca The mechanical activation technology is grounded on the action of mechanical energy on solid substance in a high-energy mill ( The mechanical activation by an ultra centrifugal mill was applied as an additional grain mixture treatment in this study, because phosphate ore treated via mechanical comminution (i.e. crushing and grinding) inherently contains a high level of impurities that decreases the quality of a final product. The phosphate grain energy conversion and properties that are induced by mechanical force were monitored and expressed in form of the grain inertia change through the proposed operating hypothesis of an automatic grain counter. The main goal of the study was to highlight the optimal set of activation parameters that can reduce the negative effect of phosphate immanent properties on the final score and to enhance the material reactivity which can be efficiently used in rationalization of processing of a target material. The phosphate ore was acquired from the “Lisina” deposit in Serbia. The investigated ore is classified as an intermediate grade sedimentary phosphate rock. A representative ore sample of 300 A standard dry sieve analysis was applied to assess the grain-size distribution of the initial ore sample (ASTM C136/C136M-14). The analyses were performed on five samples obtained by the cone & quartering method from a 10 The grain mixtures from 10 The investigated phosphate grain mixture was mechanically activated by means of a Retsch ZM-1 ultra-centrifugal mill with a peripheral comminution path (Gemini BV, Netherlands). The working principle of the ultra-centrifugal mill can be mathematically explained by the following equation ( where: The rotor power (provided by manufacturer Retsch) is Circumferential rate of the rotor can be calculated as follows ( where: The conducted experiment of phosphate grain mixture dry mechanical activation is based on a grinding kinetic model ( An automatic grain counter — Coulter Counter (Coulter/Beckman) that is able to measure the grain size of a powdery solid material by registering differences in electrical resistivity produced by analyzed particles was applied in this study where: The response/resistance of the electrolyte segment without grain is given in The change of the element/segment resistance caused by the grain presence (δ(Δ The external resistance of the observed system is high enough to annul the minor change of the segment resistance caused by the presence of a grain (Δ A physical value usually represents the change of another value; therefore the generated voltage, as an AGC instrument response, can represent the change of the grain inertia. Namely, the part of the electric voltage dimension (l The inertia of a spherical grain in its gravity center is: where: The radius of a hypothetical spherical grain can be expressed as the radius of the mean grain ( The specific surface area (SSA) of a powdery material can be expressed as: Finally the change of the grain inertia measured by AGC is represented by following equation ( Qualitative mineralogical analysis was performed on the ore samples via a polarized microscope with passing through light “JENAPOL-U” (Carl Zeiss-Jena). The analysis was conducted according to the immersion method (immersion ksilol). The magnification of objective lens was 3.2–50 times (Leitz Wetzlar binocular magnifier accompanied with a system for microphotography “STUDIO PCTV”, Pinnacle Systems). Mineralogical changes in the initial and activated samples were analyzed by an X-ray powder diffraction technique (XRD). The XRD patterns were obtained on a Philips PW-1710 automated diffractometer using a Cu tube operated at 40 Prior to the mechanical activation treatment, an identification of the present minerals in the investigated phosphate ore was carried out by means of a polarized microscope accompanied with the microphotography system according to the procedure described in Section After mechanical pre-treatment (i.e. crushing and grinding) according to the procedure described in the Section where: A double logarithmic Multiplication of The theoretical value of the specific surface area can be obtained from the following equation if the mean diameter is known ( where: The initial period of mechanical activation of the prepared phosphate ore mixture was set at 15  It can be noted that the share of finer fractions is significantly higher in the activated sample in comparison with the input sample, i.e. the fraction frequency ( The phosphate samples were further activated for 30, 45, 60, 120 and 180 The specific surface area (SSA) increased for approximately 40% from the starting 6.25 The SSA was rapidly increasing for activation sequences that lasted 30, 45 and 60 As it can be seen from According to the chemical analysis ( The initial non-activated phosphate sample (S The major identified crystalline mineral phases present in the non-activated ( The reduction of peak intensities of most of the present minerals, disappearance of certain peaks and appearance of new diffraction lines are indicated in XRD diffractograms, presented in A general conclusion, regarding results obtained via XRD analysis, is that the activation promoted evident variations in the crystallinity of the detected mineral phases. The changes in the intensity of phase lines depended on the treatment duration. The most distinctive decrease in the crystallinity was observed in the XRD diffractogram ( The scanning electron microscopy was employed to monitor the changes that occurred in the microstructure of phosphate grains during grinding in the ultra-centrifugal mill ( The previous identifications of minerals present in the non-activated phosphate sample via a polarized microscope ( The investigation was conducted with an aim to monitor the energy conversion in the phosphate ore grains during mechanical activation via an ultra-centrifugal mill and to evaluate the optimal duration of the applied treatment. The change in the grain size related parameters, which is ascribed to the strain increase due to the applied mechanical force, influenced the energy state, crystallinity and microstructural properties of the phosphate. The phosphate ore grain size underwent a significant decrease during 180 This investigation is supported by the Serbian
