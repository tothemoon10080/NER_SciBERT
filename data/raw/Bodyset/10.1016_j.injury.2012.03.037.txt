Arash Moghaddam's article, “Cigarette smoking influences the clinical and occupational outcome of patients with tibial shaft fractures”, of volume 42, issue 12, December 2011, provided inadequate evidence in its effort to show whether cigarette smoking is a real adverse risk in fracture healing. Although the two groups of patients had homogeneous demographic characteristics, there were differences in the severity of injuries. The proportion of injuries due to high energy trauma were higher in the smokers’ group (28%) compared to the non-smokers’ group (7.7%). All the Gustilo Type II injuries were sustained in the smokers’ group. All the 42C (AO classification) injuries occurred in the smokers’ group with the exception of one patient. The risk of delayed union or non-union is known to be higher with these higher energy injuries. In addition, there was no homogeneity in the type of fixation. Intramedullary nailing was the choice of preference in both groups but the number of patients in smokers’ group who had plate osteosynthesis was higher (10 versus 5). Does this reflect the comminution fracture site or it was the surgeon preference? Periosteal vascularity may have been compromised. In the article there was no reference to the postoperative weight bearing protocol. Were all the patients allowed to bear weight in the same postoperative interval? If not, does this reflect the degree of rigidity of the fixation? The effect on bone healing of a number of confounding factors has not been fully explored. Based on the above I do not agree with the authors’ view that smoking is the only independent factor that influenced fracture healing in their study. I, Dimitra Leivadiotou, author of the ‘Letter to the Editor’ manuscript hereby declare that I don’t have any conflicts of interest to disclose.
