 When an excavation is made in a rock mass, there may be a need to The term There can be some overlap between the two terms. In the case of a thick layer of shotcrete, for example, the shotcrete acts as a reinforcement in the sense that it inhibits rock block rotation and weathering, but it can also act as a structural element containing tangential stresses ( Thus, the need to reinforce and support the rock mass surrounding an excavation and the method by which this can be achieved successfully depend on two key factors: the The questions in this chapter examine basic aspects of the rock stabilization concept. There are questions on rock reinforcement, rock support and an intermediate case. The questions in this chapter do not cover specific rock engineering design (these are in    Rating these configurations in order from best to worst according to the criterion ‘tension with little shear force applied’ gives: b, a and c, d, f, e.   The limiting condition of the block/plane interface having reached peak strength gives where Rearranging gives the required answer of To find the minimal rockbolt tension, we set the partial derivative of Rearranging gives tan Thus, the rockbolt tension is minimized when the rockbolt is installed at an angle to the slope which is the same as the angle of friction between the rock block and the slope. For a plane with a very low angle of friction, i.e.,        where The free body diagram of the block, with the various forces acting on it resolved parallel and normal to the interface, is as shown to the right. From this we obtain and If we consider that the component   leading to for the factor of safety. (b) For the case of a factor of safety of 1, these expressions rearrange to which are identical. With (c) Evaluating the two expressions for factor of safety over a range of values for the tension gives the results shown in the table below. These results are plotted in the following diagram. For those circumstances when we require a factor of safety greater than one, we should use the expression for a positive restraining component, as this gives the lower — and therefore most conservative — factor of safety. (d) When two rock surfaces shear past one another, their geometric roughness means that dilation will tend to take place. If the pieces of rock on either side of the shearing surface are connected together with a rock bolt, then the bolt will tend to prevent the dilation. However, in doing this, a tensile force will be generated in the bolt. This indicates that untensioned bolts only act as stabilizing elements once some rock block shear displacement has occurred. No tensile force exists before this, (e) On the basis of the definition of factor of safety we gave earlier, a factor of safety of 3 means that we are providing three times more strength to the interface than is required. This implies that we are preventing any movement occurring, and hence we must use tensioned bolts. The bolt force required to develop a factor of safety of 3, is then    To provide some comparison with this value, a car tyre pressure is typically about 170 kPa, which is about nine times larger. Note that this calculation is only for the loosened blocks in the roof; blocks in other parts of the EDZ would be partially supported by the blocks beneath them, and so would require a lower support pressure.      To find the area of roof each rock bolt will support, we equate the rockbolt load, 150 kN from A16.4, to the support pressure times the roof area required, The 2.8       When a force is applied to an interface, slip can occur if the force, In the excavation peripheral rock, one principal stress is perpendicular to the excavation surface with a value of zero, and the other is parallel to the excavation surface. This enables the construction below to be used in which the regions susceptible to interlayer slip can be readily identified — as those where the angle between the tangent to the excavation surface and the normal to the layers is greater than the angle of interlayer friction,  We encourage you to become adept at using this construction by mentally constructing sketches such as those shown here: it is a powerful technique to use when observing problems in underground excavations. Note that the solutions for several fracture sets can be superimposed.     The      Recalling that stress is a tensor quantity with six independent components, in the general case it is not possible to re-establish the (b) For either ground response curve, A or B, although it is not possible to re-establish the However, attempting to insist on zero rock displacement at the excavation periphery is unnecessary. In the case of curve A, the rock unloads to a stable position at zero support pressure, so no support is necessary. If support is installed after some displacement has occurred, as represented by the dashed line in the sketch, the rock displacement will be stopped at point S In the case of curve B, assuming that the rock is not unloading to a stable position, the installation of support is necessary. If the same support represented by the dashed line in the sketch is used, the rock displacement will be stopped at point S     To find the ground characteristic we need to identify the two end points of the line: one is the where However, as we have not been given a value for the shear modulus, let us assume a value of 2 If we assume that the lining behaves as a thick-walled cylinder subject to radial loading, then the equation for the lining characteristic is where where To use Eq. The operating point can now be found: (b) If the lining is installed after a radial displacement of 1       Because the pillar is very long in the and then substituting this in the first equation leads to  where the spring stiffness, Combining these last two equations gives which, upon rearranging, gives The case of zero horizontal strain of the pillar is represented in this equation by an infinite spring stiffness. This condition reduces the above equation to from which we see that the ratio of vertical stress to support pressure is (1 (b) The Hoek–Brown criterion can be written as which, upon substitution of the numerical values given here and assuming Rearranging this to give a quadratic in from which we find If we rearrange the equation for the pillar stiffness, we can obtain and hence by substitution find To determine the area of steel bars required to provide this stiffness, we examine the force compatibility for a unit area of pillar face. The relation between strain and stress in the support is  To improve the efficiency of the reinforcement, it would be appropriate to apply a tension to the bars during installation. This would generate the required support pressure directly, without requiring the pillar to deform elastically. This is known as The book by Hoek et al. (1995) There is specific reference material available on rock reinforcement. For example, the Schlumberger Lecture Award paper by Windsor (1997) Areas of intact rock Rock Areas of asperities Internal fixture Areas of infill Element Areas of planar friction External fixture A publication by Villaescusa et al. (1999) Our main emphasis in this book is on rock mechanics applied to civil and mining engineering, but the mechanical principles apply to all rock engineering. In petroleum engineering, the occurrence of unstable boreholes is a major problem — not only in inclined and sub-horizontal wells but also in vertical wells. The mechanical understanding of borehole in The most elegant stabilization option is, if possible, to develop an excavation geometry such that no stabilization is necessary. In terms of rock fractures, an excavation can be oriented such that minimal rock block instability occurs, and, in terms of stress concentration (the amount by which an applied stress component is concentrated by the excavation), tunnels oriented parallel to the maximal principal stress experience the least stress concentrations on their boundaries. In an isotropic stress field, a circular tunnel cross-section reduces the maximal stress concentration to a factor of 2. In an anisotropic stress field, with the horizontal to vertical stress ratio being Deviatoric stresses (i.e. the difference between the major and minor principal stresses) produce shear stresses which in turn cause failure. When the excavation is made, the stress normal to the excavation surface is reduced to zero, creating high shear stresses in the rock adjacent to the opening. Another stabilization option considered in the early days of rock mechanics was to move these shear stresses further back into the rock using a rock slotting technique (
