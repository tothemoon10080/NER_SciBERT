Recent studies on the oral processing of hard and soft foods are presented with consideration for the underlying physics involved during the transformation of food to a semifluid bolus for swallowing. Significant insights are being realised about the temporal aspects of the dominant processes of comminution, agglomeration, hydration and dilution, and connections to the dominant textural properties are emerging. The field is still challenged by inter-individual differences in oral physiology, but in vitro approaches to characterise the evolution of the food bolus have the potential to provide structure–property–oral processing relationships. Integrated approaches and development of techniques to measure the in-use physics of oral processing are critical for advanced food structure design.

The physics associated with the dynamic alteration of food during oral processing is challenging to understand and measure Quantitative description analysis (QDA) has been used to describe the sensory perception of food and many attempts, of varying success, have been made relating this to food structure Attempts are made to mechanistically understand the dynamics of sensory perception during oral processing in relation to the pressures applied on food by the oral physiology using Of increasing recent interest, and a major challenge in oral processing research, is consideration for saliva's multifaceted dynamic roles A recent review of the bolus formation process, involving structural degradation and mixing in saliva, is provided by Bornhorst Recent studies show how the fracture properties of biscuits The influence of intact food hardness, deformability and stickiness of cheese and caramel These studies show that the energy of comminution is dependent on the food's mechanical properties and microstructure. This is broadly in line with studies and modelling on the physics of comminution for hard rock-like materials that are well studied in the engineering literature The mechanical properties of emulsion filled gels affect chew down, firmness, creaminess and grittiness The textures arising from mastication of peanuts varying in their physical form The main procedures used to prepare comminuted food, grinding or shredding using house-hold appliances, are problematic as they do not necessarily replicate the oral-comminution process. To combat this issue, several groups have produced mechanical devices to simulate the oral-comminution process, producing particles with similar size distributions to Attempts are underway to model oral processing of foods using smoothed particle hydrodynamics in order to simulate the action of the major oral surfaces upon manipulating fluids, brittle foods, elastoplastic foods and elastobrittle foods The physics of bolus formation is a dynamic process changing from dry comminuted particles which behave as a flowing powder To examine the influence on mastication from the initial moisture content of dutch cake (22% moisture content) and white bread (44% moisture content), Motoi A significant complication to the study of bolus formation Physiological differences in chewing, mastication strength, age and salivary flow rate are factors affecting bolus properties, oral processing time and sensory percepts including texture To avoid inter-individual and intra-individual differences in chewing behaviour and saliva-secretion, Boehm  In recent years, great strides are being made in developing mechanistic insights into the mastication process. We provide a schematic in Many challenges exist in studying the physics of oral processing. A key observation from the recent literature is that the middle stages of oral processing are still not well understood beyond observations of agglomeration, moisture increases and a sensation of dryness/hydration Advances in TDS and its utilisation provides the potential to link the dynamic textural changes occurring during oral processing to structural and physical properties of the food and food-bolus.
