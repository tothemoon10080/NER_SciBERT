The selection of the blast damage zone thickness T for the Hoek-Brown (HB) criterion is significant in open pit slope design and stability analysis. Traditional slope stability analysis adopts a single value of blast damage factor D for the entire rock mass, leading to the underestimation of slope stability. In this research, the parallel layer model (PLM), in which the rock mass is divided into a number of layers parallel to the slope face with a decreasing value of D applied to each layer, is used with the limit equilibrium method to investigate the effects of T on the stability of rock slopes. Based on extensive parametric studies, a blast damage zone thickness weighting factor f
                     T is proposed to quantify the influence of T on the evaluation of the factor of safety (FOS) of given slopes. Results show that the selection of T in the slope model plays an important role in the calculation of FOS, especially, when the ratio of T to slope height H is <1.0. Based on f
                     T and existing stability charts, a stability model is proposed for the estimation of the FOS of slopes with different slope geometries and rock mass properties. The reliability of the proposed stability model is tested against numerical solutions. The results show that FOS estimated from the proposed stability model exhibits only 5.6% average relative discrepancy compared with numerical solutions based on 1254 sets of data. The proposed stability model is simple and effective, and can be used for the preliminary assessment of rock slope stability, considering the effects of different degree of blast damagesPractical experience in the design of rock slope projects has demonstrated that the estimated rock mass strength of a given slope is affected by the blast damage in slope excavations ( The value of The value of Engineering experience in the design of large open pit slopes has demonstrated that it is not easy to estimate the accurate value of The thickness of blast damage zone depends on blast design factors (explosive type, charge, drill hole diameter and burden) and rock mass mechanical properties.  The determination of the rate of reduction of These guidelines for the selection of Currently, there are three models available for the slope stability analysis considering the effects of blasting damage on the calculation of factor of safety (FOS) of given slopes, as shown in Based on the literature review, it is found that the traditional slope model ( Rock slope stability assessment is critical in open pit mines, and the HB criterion has been successfully used for the estimation of rock mass strength in rock engineering for the past decades ( As input parameters of the HB criterion can be obtained directly from assessment of uniaxial and triaxial compressive testing of intact rocks, measurement of discontinuity characteristics of rock masses and evaluation of blast conditions, many stability charts were developed to estimate the FOS directly from the HB input parameters for the past ten years using different analysis methods, such as limit analysis method ( However, these stability charts are based on the traditional blast damage model (see In this research, the parallel layer model (PLM) is used with the limit equilibrium method (LEM) to investigate the effects of blast damage zone thickness In this research, the parallel layer model, which assigns a linearly decreasing It should be noted that the number of layers of blast damage zone could influence the FOS in LEM, as shown in  It is not a simple task to determine the exact blast damage zone thickness Here, based on the parallel layer model, limit equilibrium analyses were carried out to investigate the effects of The strength ratio (SR) in Here, we proposed a blast damage zone thickness weighting factor  Based on the statistical analysis of Based on the weighting factor The use of the proposed stability model to calculate the FOS of a given slope is simple. An example with The prediction performance of the stability model was then tested using 1254 sets of data which cover a wide range of rock properties and slope geometries, as shown in The results show that 53.7% of cases have the discrepancy less than Â±5%; the absolute average relative error percentage (AAREP) is only 5.6%, and the maximum discrepancy ( The Cadia Hill open pit slope with complex slope geometries and rock mass properties ( In order to calculate the FOS of this slope using the proposed stability model, it is suggested to carry out stability analyses to identify the lower and upper values of FOS. For this case, the values of rock mass properties of domain 10 and domain 4S were used to calculate the lower and upper bound values of FOS. The calculation steps are as follows: (1) From In this research, the parallel layer model (PLM), which adopts a linearly decreasing Based on comprehensive slope stability analyses, a blast damage zone thickness weighting factor A guideline was proposed as a starting point for estimating the Finally, a real open pit slope case with complex slope geometries and rock mass properties was used to illustrate the use of the proposed stability model. The results demonstrated a close agreement between the proposed stability model and the This research has been funded by the
