The effect of fabrication method on the properties of hierarchical 3D TiO2 nanostructures was investigated by employing and developing both hydrothermal method and calcination method to synthesize hierarchical 3D TiO2 nanorod spheres in this study. A comprehensive comparison in terms of morphologies, crystallization, specific surface areas, light absorption capabilities, and photoluminescence spectrum was conducted between 3D TiO2 nanorod spheres synthesized via hydrothermal method and that synthesized via calcination method. A better photocatalytic activity was demonstrated over the TiO2 nanorod spheres synthesized through calcination method. This was ascribed to the better crystallization and monodispersion of the hierarchical 3D TiO2 nanorod spheres resulted from the calcination method; thus rendering it with more superior characteristics such as larger specific surface area, enhanced light absorption capability and faster transfer of electrons which suppress the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. This study is thus significant not only in promoting the development of hierarchical 3D TiO2 nanorod spheres via different methods, but also in revealing the effect of fabrication method on the photocatalytic activity of hierarchical 3D TiO2 nanorod spheres. The calcination method is proposed to be a facile and promising method for scale-up production of the hierarchical 3D TiO2 nanorod spheres with high photocatalytic activity for efficient pollutants degradation.Owing to its unique properties such as environmental benign, low cost, chemical stability and high photocatalytic activity, TiO Wet-chemistry based hydrothermal method is popularly used for the synthesis of TiO Unlike the widely studied hydrothermal method, high temperature calcination could provide a better route to synthesize well crystallized TiO Dye wastewater generated from textile industries has become a growing environmental concern in line with rapid industrialization. More attentions have been given to purify the dye wastewater Unlike previous reports After naturally cooled down, the autoclave was opened gently with a pungent smell emitted. The white precipitates at the bottom of the autoclave were sufficiently washed with DI water for further characterization and test. The TiO Instead of the conventionally used hydrothermal method, a facile high temperature calcination method was developed to scale-up fabrication of the 3D TiO The structure and the crystal phase of the samples were analyzed by powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker AXS D8 advance) with monochromated high-intensity Cu Kα radiation ( As a common organic dye in wastewater, acid orange (AO 7) (C Similar to the photodegradation of AO 7, rhodamine B (RhB) (C In the previous experimental section, the detailed processes for the synthesis of TiO Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was employed to observe the morphologies of the TiO The crystal phases of the TiO The UV–vis spectrum of TiO Where Where The inset in The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectrum is commonly used to evaluate the extent of transfer and separation of photogenerated electrons and holes on the surface of photocatalysts upon excitation The porous structures of the TiO The photocatalytic activities of TiO Similarly, for the photodegradation of RhB, prior to the photocatalytic reaction the concentration change of RhB in the mixed solution was monitored at different interval to determine the adsorption of RhB by TiO The reason for the higher photocatalytic activity of TiO In this study, we have synthesized 3D hierarchical TiO
