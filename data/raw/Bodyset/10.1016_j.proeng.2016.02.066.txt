In the phosphates mines, the modes of extraction and treatment used were adapted to protect the quality of the various phosphate levels, avoid the deterioration of the extracted qualities, separate the rejections as soon as possible in the production line and use the most adapted techniques for the phosphate beneficiation within the framework of sustainable development
                  To improve the quality of products, we developed new wash and flotation processes of sedimentary phosphates with carbonate or silico-carbonate gangue. Their enrichment knows a big development and arouses a particular interest, which is motivated by the increasing product's demand and by the need to handle the enrichment of phosphate levels that cannot be done by the conventional treatment processes.
                  The use of these processes in an industrial scale and its integration in the installations and the factories realized within the framework of the OCP industrial program allowed to rationalize the phosphate deposits exploitation and to increase their durations, to value all the phosphate series layer, to improve the productivity, to extend the deposits life expectancy in exploitation, to produce marketable and diverted qualities of phosphate and to ensure the integration of the various phosphate deposits layers exploitation in the OCP strategic development project based on the sustainable development.
                  The valorization of phosphates, during all the value chain follow an integrated industrial process since the extraction of the rock, beneficiation, and transportation with the pipeline until the industrial Valorization.
                  The results obtained on the industrial scale are conclusive viable and confirmed the results obtained in laboratories and pilots scale; Using these new processes lead to:
