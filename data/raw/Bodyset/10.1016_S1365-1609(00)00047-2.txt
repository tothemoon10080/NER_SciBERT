Natural and induced stress states around man-made openings in rock generally have different magnitudes along the principal axes. Accordingly, appropriate stability analyses should be based on expressions that take into account the full stress tensor. Based on the main features of compressive and tensile failure of isotropic media, the authors propose a general multiaxial criterion for describing the short-term failure (STF) strength as well as the damage initiation threshold (DIT) of rocks and rock masses. Time and size effects are explicitly included in the formulation. The influence of time is described by an extension of the subcritical crack growth theory in which the DIT is introduced. This damage initiation threshold represents the stress state below which there is virtually no crack growth, and hence corresponds to the long-term rock strength. Size effects, on the other hand, are treated using a generalized version of existing power-law expressions in which limiting values have been imposed for the relative size of representative elements. Application of the criterion to rock masses is done using simultaneously the size effect function for the case where no new types of defects are introduced, and a function of the RMR geomechanical classification to take into account the influence of new types of discontinuities such as joint sets. Sample applications of the criterion, using simplified calculations for rock structures, are shown and briefly discussed.slope of the linear portion of the MSDP material parameters used to describe the time to failure difference between the applied stress and the DIT difference between the short-term failure (STF) strength and the applied stress frictional angle basic friction angle residual friction angle Poisson's ratio Lode angle net stress major, intermediate and minor principal stresses, respectively applied stress uniaxial compressive strength parameter (= uniaxial compressive damage initiation threshold uniaxial compressive strength of the rock at size uniaxial compressive strength of rock mass  uniaxial compressive strength of the rock at size Cauchy stress tensor minimum asymptotic strength of the material at large-scale (for ≥ nominal strength of sample with nominal size maximum strength for a homogeneous representative volume element of isotropic material (corresponding to uniaxial tensile strength parameter (=| damage initiation threshold under uniaxial tension uniaxial tensile strength of the rock at size uniaxial tensile strength of rock mass uniaxial tensile strength of the rock at size shear and normal stress components, respectively continuity parameter ( material parameters included in MSDP material parameters taking into account the continuity parameter uniaxial compressive strength (also constants damage variable (scalar) damage variable (tensor) mean grain size large-scale reference size of material nominal size of sample maximum strength size of material representative volume element elastic modulus of intact (“undamaged”) rock elastic modulus of damaged rock media elastic modulus of rock mass function defining the shape of MSDP function controlling the shape of the criterion in the π(octahedral) plane first invariant of stress tensor second invariant of deviatoric stress tensor crack initiation threshold critical stress concentration factor stress concentration factor Hoek–Brown criterion parameters porosity of material exponent used to describe the influence of continuity parameter exponent used to relate the modulus and uniaxial strength ratio deviatoric stress tensor uniaxial tensile strength (negative value) (=− time to failure crack tip velocity material parameters used to describe size effects MacCauley brackets (〈 A polyaxial stress state exists around underground openings and must be taken into account for properly assessing the stability of man-made excavations. Over the years, a number of criteria have been proposed to evaluate the possible occurrence of rock failure. Many of these have been included in synthesis presentations e.g. However, for detailed studies required by some of the most challenging rock engineering projects, such as large-scale caverns, transportation tunnels in difficult ground conditions, underground storage reservoirs, and toxic waste disposal facilities, it is usually recognized that more elaborate models are required In this paper, the authors present a general function that has been formulated in a unified and modular manner, so it can be adapted to a variety of rock media conditions and structural calculations. The proposed MSDP The proposed multiaxial criterion, identified hereafter as MSDP  In the above equations, parameters This continuity parameter can be seen as an equivalent damage parameter The effect of initial porosity is also reflected by the last term on the right-hand side of This new criterion for rock media, given by As will be shown below, the equations proposed here allow the criterion to properly describe a very wide range of conditions. The application of the MSDP Among the attributes and key features of the MSDP Failure under a multiaxial tensile load can occur at a smaller absolute value of the minor principal stress Biaxial compressive strength is higher than the uniaxial compressive strength (i.e., In a multiaxial test, application of a small confining compressive stress may increase the tensile strength (i.e., | The apparent friction angle associated with the slope of the criterion in the The material strength depends on the loading geometry (and thus on the full triaxial stress state); in the All rocks may show a mechanical response that is time (or rate) dependent The proposed MSDP The MSDP Between the short- and long-term failure surfaces, the strength of rock samples submitted to deviatoric loading is expected to decrease over time. For a given stress state, one can estimate the time to failure using an extension of Charles It was shown by Charles For a given stress state, Charles law can be used to estimate the time to failure: By introducing the threshold Using the similitude principle by which one can estimate the macroscopic response (with a scaling law) using the same expression as for the microscopic conditions, one can then write  The strength of brittle and semi-brittle materials is influenced by scale, as the observed peak stress usually decreases with sample size. This phenomenon, which is well known in rock mechanics With brittle rocks, it has been observed experimentally that the uniaxial compressive strength decreases when specimen size increases Rock strength diminishes until the specimen size becomes equal to that of the large-scale reference size Many size effect functions exist. For that purpose, various researchers (e.g. It is important to recall here that size effects are related to the presence and influence of defects (at various scales) on material behavior. Because increasing the confining pressure may reduce the influence of existing flaws, it can also reduce size effect. This phenomenon has been illustrated, for instance, by the results from Gerogiannopoulos and Brown To treat this aspect with MSDP The size effect theoretically disappears only when a fully plastic behavior is encountered (often at very high mean stress), but for practical calculations with low porosity rocks, it can be considered, as a first estimate, that it becomes almost negligible when the shear strength of a closed microcrack surface becomes equal to the cohesion of the surrounding rock material. Using the Coulomb criterion for the shear strength of the rock and rock surface, this condition can be approximated by the following expression: In the previous section, it was assumed that The continuous scale effect described above applies when there are no new type of flaws introduced in the media. However, going from intact rock to in situ rock mass implies not only the usual statistical and energy release size effects, but also the addition of other types of larger scale defects such as joint sets. Thus, the relationship used for scaling up properties may become more or less discontinuous The problem can be further complicated when adding only one or two defect families or few individual members, as the material may then intrinsically behave anisotropically. In this case, one must either use an anisotropic criterion Rock masses with more than two distinct joint sets usually behave almost isotropically on a large-scale. It is thus often considered that an isotropic criterion is appropriate for such cases In the presence of defects within the internal structure of the rock mass, the continuity is reduced, or the damage state is increased. With MSDP For porous materials, such as high porosity rocks and highly weathered or disturbed rock masses, it can be expected that some inelastic yielding may occur under a high mean stress, even with little or no deviatoric stress It is worth mentioning here that the shape of this closed surface is very similar to functions developed for yielding of other types of porous media Applications of MSDP From the onset, it was the authors’ intent to formulate a general criterion that could be applied not only to the behavior of hard and soft rocks with a low porosity, but also to yielding and failure of porous, fractured, or weathered media, either at the laboratory scale or at a larger scale corresponding to in situ rock mass conditions. Admittedly, this was (and remains) quite a challenge. One of the difficulties in that regard stems from the fact that it is usually difficult to perform appropriate tests to obtain adequate in situ rock mass properties (strength and deformability) at a scale corresponding to engineering structures. Consequently, the usual approach in rock mechanics has been to rely on laboratory properties “corrected” for scale and discontinuity conditions. For that purpose, several techniques have been proposed The basic approach to estimate rock mass strength and/or deformability is to combine the behavior of intact rock and of discontinuities, using analytical or numerical models Alternately, one can make use of an equivalent media approach. In that regard, the continuum damage mechanics (CDM) approach The definition of the damage variable For strength and stability calculations, the continuity parameter From a damage mechanics point of view, parameter  For this application of the MSDP The value of parameter  At this point, it must be recalled that the quantity and quality of information pertaining to actual in situ rock mass properties are limited, so that it is still quite a challenge to put forward meaningful correlations between laboratory and in situ properties (see discussions by Hoek The MSDP The analysis of simple structures is based on the usual assumption that failure occurs when the local value of the safety factor becomes critical. In these sample applications, the safety factor is defined simply as   Such analyses illustrate, in a very simplified manner, how the criterion can be used for stability calculations. Using basically the same procedure, it has also been shown recently that the MSDP The results shown above for laboratory tests illustrate only partially how the criterion applies to actual in situ underground openings. To further demonstrate that the various components of the proposed general criterion can actually be applied to large-scale problems, a simplified analysis is made on the progressive local failure zone observed around a large-scale tunnel at the AECL underground facilities. The parameters used for the rock media properties, given in The general criterion proposed above is simple to use, and can be applied for a wide variety of rock media characteristics and loading conditions. Like any other criterion, it also has some limitations. The authors nevertheless believe that the sound physical basis from which it has been formulated, its unified and modular nature, and its adaptability to treat hard and soft materials with little ( It is nevertheless useful to point out some of its actual limitations: Finally, this presentation has not taken into account the intrinsic variability of rock media properties. As with any other criteria, this aspect should be treated adequately with MSDP In this paper, the authors have presented a general multiaxial criterion named MSDP Part of this work has been financed through grants from NSERC (OGP 0089749) and IRSST; these contributions are gratefully acknowledged. The authors would also like to thank Professor Hani Mitri, from McGill University, for his comments on the manuscript. To recall the origin of the proposed criterion, the authors present in this appendix a brief review of the MSDP For low-porosity rocks, the failure surface is defined by a continuous function opened on the compressive side and closed on the tensile side. On this curve, some points represent specific stress states. Point A is the uniaxial compressive strength ( The MSDP failure criterion was developed based on the previously stated considerations. Like most existing criteria, it is essentially phenomenological, but it also satisfies basic physical principles.
