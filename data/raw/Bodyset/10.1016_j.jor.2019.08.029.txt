Treatment of proximal humerus fractures in the elderly has long been a topic of controversial discussion amongst trauma surgeons. Until RSA became available most surgeons favored conservative treatment even in, or especially in, severely comminuted fractures of the elderly because anatomic reduction and fixation is almost impossible to achieve in osteoporotic bone. Slight differences in functional outcome were reported by some but the overall impression gained from thorough literature research was largely in line with the results published by Hanson. Since proximal humerus fractures of the elderly bear some comparable features with proximal femur fractures i.e. increased risk of head necrosis with higher grades of comminution, a joint replacing approach is most appealing but less successful. Further evaluations have shown that the outcome after RSA depends partially on patient perspective and assessment methods so we used physical tests as well as self-reporting evaluations. Twenty three patients at the age of 52–90 years who were operated due to proximal humerus fractures from September 2011 to February 2017 were included in this retrospective study. All patients were provided with a DELTA XTEND prosthesis (DePuy Synthes). Indications for RSA were an extended rotator cuff defect and fracture displacement. An extended rotator cuff defect was defined as tears ≥5 cm or defects with two or more tendons involved. Patients with severe neurologic, cardiac or pulmonal comorbidities were excluded. All patients gave written informed consent to participate in the study. Ethics approval was obtained from the local ethics committee (No. D463/16). The DELTA XTEND prosthesis is a total semi-constrained shoulder arthroplasty. The scapula-humeral joint center of rotation is moved medially and inferiorly, which increases the deltoid lever arm and deltoid tension. Therefore the deltoid muscle can compensate for impaired rotator cuff strength. The surgical technique utilized the Delta Split/McKenzie approach. The prosthesis is composed of a humeral component and a glenoid baseplate component secured with the use of a central peg available in three sizes along with two variable angle locking and two compression screws. The humeral component consists of a cementless modular titanium hydroxyapatite (HA)-coated or Monobloc cobalt-chromium (Co–Cr) cemented stem. The humeral articulation offers various polyethylene (PE) cup thicknesses. The metaglene has a curved back to help with bone preservation and is placed at the inferior margin. The metaglene is smaller with a curved back to help with bone preservation and placed at the inferior edge of the glenoid with the intent to reduce scapular notching. All operation were performed by 4 surgeons. Pre- and postoperative X-rays were analyzed and fractures were classified according to Neer by CTscan. The Neer classification is probably the most frequently used along with the AO classification of proximal humerus fractures. The two major parts of the classification are number of fragments and displacement. All patients underwent an orthopedic examination of the upper limbs. Flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, internal rotation and external rotation as well as internal and external rotation in 90° abduction range of motion were measured in degrees using a goniometer. Internal and external rotations were also measured with the humerus abducted in the frontal plane to 90° and the elbow flexed to 90°. The unoperated side of every patient served as control. Power was measured by a weight gage (Kern, Switzerland) in Kilograms (kg). The weight gage was attached to the floor and patients arm, 1 cm proximal of Processus styloideus radii and ulnae. Static power was measured in exact position. The unoperated side of every patient served as control. The Constant Score is a 100-points scale composed of a number of individual parameters It measures Pain (15 points), Activities of Daily Life (ADL) (20 points), Range of Motion (40 points) and Power (25 points). The range of motion is divided in forward elevation, external rotation, abduction and internal rotation. Subjective findings (severity of pain, activities of daily living and working in different positions) sum up to 35 points and objective measurements (range of motion and strength) refer to 65 points. Of all patients a Constant Score and an EQ5D3L questionnaire were obtained. Postoperative data of the operated shoulder were compared with the non-operated side. The EQ5D3L questionnaire measures general health parameters. The outcome is differentiated into “descriptive” measures and a visual scale for health. The descriptive system comprises the following 5 subdivisions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each subdivision has the following levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate the health state by placing a cross in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 subgroups. The visual scale shows the patient's self-rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale. The endpoints are marked as ‘Best imaginable health state’ and ‘Worst imaginable health state’. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as ranked by the individual patient. Correlation was tested between results of Constant Score and EQ5D3L, abduction and strength in 45° abduction, abduction and strength in 90° abduction, age and results of Constant Score, time period postoperative and results of Constant Score. Statistics were calculated using SPSS 14.0 for Windows. We performed a descriptive analysis. Results are displayed as mean with standard deviation (SD). Differences were tested for significance using the Student-t-test. Associations between variables were quantified by means of Pearson's correlation coefficient. Significance was assumed, when p ≤ 0.05. In our evaluation 20 patients (87.0%) were female and 3 patients (13.0%) were male. The mean age was 86.0 ± 1.0 years in male patients and 78.85 ± 10.40 years in female patients. Concerning primary surgical treatment the mean age is 82.41 ± 6.36 years and concerning secondary treatment a mean value of 72.3 ± 14.79 years. In terms of fracture classification we included 14 patients (61.0%) with a type Neer 4 fracture and 9 patients (39.0%) with a type Neer 3 fracture. 17 patients (74%) were primary operated with a RSA and 6 patients (26%) were secondary treated surgically after fracture displacement. 3 of these 6 patients were initially treated conservatively with a Gilchrist splint. Initially one patient received a targon nail one an anatomic shoulder prosthesis and one was stabilized with an angular stable locking plate (PHILOS) plate. The time period (data not shown) between initial surgery and insertion of a RSA took in average 263.33 ± 202.86 days. In case of conservative treatment the time period took in average 92.33 ± 108.86 days until operation. The mean operating time was 95.5 ± 28.21 min. For primary prosthesis it took 86.23 ± 16.23 min and for secondary prosthesis it took 121.83 ± 39.11 min. Follow-up examination was performed after 28.40 ± 10.47 months. X-ray analysis were performed after operation, 6 weeks after operation, 3 months and 6 months after operation. During follow-up examination another X-ray was performed. Imaging did not show any complications like raised height of prosthesis or loosening signs. The range of motion was significantly reduced compared to the un-operated (control-) shoulder. For abduction values were 111° ± 31.6° (Surgery) and 141.7° ± 22.18° (control) ( The average range of motion for internal rotation (operated shoulder: 81.95° ± 21.04°, un-operated shoulder 89.78° ± 4.64°; p > 0.05) and external rotation (operated shoulder 12.2° ± 10.3°, un-operated shoulder 38.3° ± 11.2°; p < 0.01) showed also different results, whereat only the difference in external rotation was significant ( A significant difference could also be seen for external rotation in 90° abduction (surgery 25,87° ± 19,11°, control 55,22° ± 12,01°, p=<0,01), but not for internal rotation in 90° abduction (surgery 38,04° ± 16,22°, control 52,39° ± 12,14°, p=<0,01) ( Strength was measured with a custom made device and recorded for abduction in 90° and in 45°. The values were 1.87 ± 1.33 kg on the operated side versus 3.10 ± 1.0 kg on the counter-side (n = 23, p < 0.01) in 90° abduction. In 45° abduction the mean was 3.5 ± 1.55 vs. 4.65 ± 1.68 kg on the operated vs the counter-side respectively (n = 23, p < 0.01). We further differentiated between primary and secondarily implanted shoulder prostheses. A range of motion of 114.71° ± 25.59° for abduction was shown after primary RSA compared to 103.33° ± 46.76° after secondary arthroplasty. Adduction of 22.06° ± 9.67° could be detected for primary surgery and adduction of 20.83° ± 12.42° after secondary surgery. Minor differences were also detected for anteversion (primary surgery: 116.47° ± 19.75°; secondary surgery 109.17° ± 44.99°) and retroversion (primary surgery: 35.59° ± 7.26°; secondary surgery: 31.67° ± 16.93°). External rotation was almost similar in both groups (primary surgery: 12.06° ± 10.62°; secondary surgery: 12.5° ± 10.37°). A higher variation was shown for internal rotation (primary surgery: 84.41° ± 12.73°; secondary surgery 75° ± 36.74°). Values for external rotation in 90° abduction were similar after primary surgery (26.47° ± 18.61°) compared to secondary surgery (24.17° ± 22.23°). Major difference could be detected for internal rotation in 90° abduction (primary surgery: 41.18° ± 14.74°; secondary surgery: 29.17° ± 18.28°), but difference was not significant. There was no significant difference in strength between primary and secondary operation. The values were 3.62 ± 1.59 kg after primary surgery vs. 3.1 ± 1.51 kg after secondary surgery in 45° abduction and 1.89 kg ± 1.38 after primary operation vs. 1.78 ± 1.31 kg in 90°. The mean Constant score was 55 ± 13 for all operated patients (n = 23). The ADL scores for work, sport and sleep and hands movement were 2.5 ± 0.7, 2.2 ± 0.6, 1.95 ± 0.21, 7.7 ± 1.8, respectively. The range of motion scores for flexion, abduction, external rotation and internal rotation were 6.3 ± 1.74; 6.1 ± 1.76; 6.5 ± 3.58; 3.8 ± 2.08 (n = 23). The total mean strength score was 3.9 ± 3.02. The mean Constant Score for patients with primary RSA comprised 57 ± 12 (n = 17) and 52 ± 18 (n = 6) for patients with secondary arthroplasty ( A mean range of motion score for flexion, abduction, external rotation and internal rotation of 6.5 ± 1.5, 6.4 ± 1.46; 6.8 ± 3.6; 4 ± 2.24 (n = 17) could be generated for patients after primary RSA. After secondary done arthroplasty the scores were 5.7 ± 2.33 (flexion), 5.3 ± 2.42 (abduction), 5.7 ± 3.67 (external rotation), 3.3 ± 1.63 (n = 6). The strength score represented 4.2 ± 2.98 (n = 17) after primary performed RSA and 3.3 ± 3.33 (n = 6) after secondary performed shoulder arthroplasty. The pain was also measured through the Constant Score. 15 patients (65.0%) stated that they had no pain after surgery. 4 patients (17%) choose scale 1. Scale 3 was listed once (4%), scale 4 twice (9%) and scale 5 once (4%). The mean value of the descriptive part of EQ5D3L achieved 6.6 ± 1.67 points for all operated patients. Primary operated patients got a mean value of 6.53 ± 1.37 points and secondary operated patients had a mean value of 6.83 ± 2.48 points ( The visual part of EQ5D3L showed a result of 75.65% (difference value 24.35%), whereat the group of primary surgery had 75.31% (difference value 25.94%) and the group of secondary surgery had 79.28% (difference value 20.71%). Pearson correlation coefficient was analyzed for results of Constant Score and descriptive part of EQ5D3L r = 0,889 and for results of Constant Score and results of visual analogue scale EQ5D3L r = 0,791 ( We determined also a Pearson correlation between strength in 90° abduction and abduction (r = 0,807) and strength in 45° abduction and abduction r = 0,665 ( Proximal humerus fractures are the third most common fragility fracture and they are associated with a substantial limitation in mobility and impaired quality of daily life. While these fractures predominantly affect older patients and the older population continues to rise, the registered number of fractures is also increasing. Type of fracture, degree of fragment displacement and fracture stability affect fracture treatment essentially. Especially in complex and displaced fractures the optimum treatment becomes less clear. The field of shoulder endoprothetics has undergone a rapid development in the last years. Displaced proximal humerus fractures, poor rotator cuff status and non-union of the tubercles in elderly patients have caused RSA growing popularity and showed promising results, even in comparison to angular stable plate fixation. In our study we focused on reversed shoulder arthroplasty and analyzed potential differences compared to the unoperated shoulder. The majority of patients were female as the incidence for proximal humerus fractures is precisely higher in the female population in general. The range of motion differed significantly between the operated shoulder and the unoperated side in our evaluation. Simply no significant difference was shown for internal rotation. Irrespective of chosen technique after complex humerus fracture the range of motion is generally reduced compared to unoperated side. Some evaluations highlight better results after RSA compared to ORIF in elderly patients, which might also be explained by poor and degenerative rotator cuff status of elder patients. Overall compared to current evaluations the postoperative range of motion was similar We evaluated 17 patients with primary operated RSA and 6 patients with secondary provided indication for reversed arthroplasty. Indication for secondary arthroplasty were fracture dislocation, implantat failure or osteonecrosis. Secondary arthroplasty correlates with lower tuberosity healing rate and reduced external rotation compared to primary operation There were also slight differences in range of motion after primary and secondary RSA, but differences were not significant. Our results come along with previous findings, while acute and secondary RSA can yield successful outcome and acute RSA. We also focused on Constant Score, which is one of the most applicable scoring systems in the follow-up of shoulder injuries. It was compared to different other objective outcome scores and showed the strongest correlation with function of the shoulder. In our evaluation the mean Constant Score was 55 ± 13 for all operated patients. Results of different postoperative evaluations showed high discrepancy. Roy et al. differed in a deficiency of 40% or less compared to age-matched normative data, which were considered as a good functional outcome. Hartel et al. found a Constant Score of 31.1 ± 18.7, the mean follow-up was obtained after 41 ± 31 months (range: 10–113) at a mean age of 69 ± 10 years (range: 46–83), Complication rate can also affect results of Constant Score and complication rates following RSA have been shown to be close to 25%. Generally patient-reported outcome measures allow comparison of health-related quality of life across populations and pathologies. This might be caused by higher dissatisfaction, pain and limited mobility caused by complications before secondary operation. Irrespective of condition before fracture, patient dissatisfaction before secondary operation was higher compared to primary operation. Some authors declare, that satisfaction of patients with their care rating is a poor indicator of shoulder function. We also found a positive correlation between Constant Score and patient age, which has been shown for rotator cuff before. As we focused on the age group over 65 years, there were no large variation to Constant Score in this group, but a slight positive correlation. Rotator cuff problems are frequent in this age group, while daily life activities and range of motion is reduced compared to younger patients. Constant Score and months postoperative showed also a slight positive correlation, as postoperative results are stable after 2 years. It is known that conclusions on the success of RSA depend on the particular outcome modality chosen. Patients showed significant better results in range of motion, strength and Constant Score after primary operation compared to secondary operated group. Only results of EQ5D3L were significant better in the secondary operated group. We found a positive correlation between Constant Score and EQ5D3L, strength and abduction, age and Constant Score and time period postoperative and Constant Score. Different outcome measures showed consensus in terms of functional outcome after primary and secondary operation. Despite concerns about self-report measures, we found high correlation between independent expert global assessment and self-reported evaluation. The combination of Constant Score and EQ5D3L seems to be a good supplementation for follow-up evaluation after RSA.
