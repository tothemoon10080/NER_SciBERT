Earthworms could affect soil C and N cycling process to balance their energy and nutrients requirements, and they could also regulate soil microbial community structure and microbial acquisition for C and N. However, the connection between faunal and microbial stoichiometry in the coupling soil C and N cycling remains poorly understood. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we amended soil with five litters differing in litter chemistry (clover, maize stover, wheat straw, Rumex and bagasse fiber) including a no litter control and treated them without or with earthworms (Metaphire guillelmi). After 90 d incubation, we examined changes in earthworm tissue and microbial stoichiometry and different soil C and N fractions. Earthworm tissue C content was rather stable compared with the fluctuation in tissue N, implying that C is under stronger control and associated with higher demand than N. The presence of earthworm significantly enhanced CO2 emissions and decreased particulate organic carbon (POC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) contents in the low lignin litter species clover, maize stover and wheat straw. Meanwhile, earthworm presence increased N2O cumulative emissions but exerted negligible effects on particulate organic nitrogen (PON) and soil total nitrogen (TN) contents irrespective of litter species. Correspondingly, earthworm regulated microbial C and N acquisition as C to N-degrading enzyme activity ratio were nearly doubled in the low lignin litter species clover, maize stover and wheat straw, while it was decreased in the high lignin litter species Rumex and bagasse fiber. However, the structural equation modeling indicated C loss induced by earthworms was mainly attributed to their effects on soil fungi and bacteria abundance, while much less related to C-degrading enzyme activities. In conclusion, litter species controlled earthworm effects on soil C and N loss and associated microbial acquisition for C and N, highlighting the pivotal role of resource chemistry in the regulation of soil fauna impact on soil functioning and ecosystem services.Litter is an important resource providing one of the main sources of energy and nutrients for the soil food web ( It is well-known that burrowing, feeding and casting activities of earthworms affect C and N cycling by regulating soil microbial and biochemical process ( Soil microbes produce extracellular enzymes to break down complex organic matter compounds and acquire bioavailable C and N ( To explore whether faunal and microbial stoichiometry help to explain the mechanisms of earthworm-driven soil C and N turnover, we performed a factorial experiment with different litter species combined with or without earthworms. Different C and N fractions as well as the CO The endogeic earthworm This experiment was set up with a two-way factorial design (earthworm × litters), with five litters including residues of clover ( The microcosms were incubated in a climate chamber at 25/15 °C day/nighttime and 12/12 h light/dark periods. The microcosms were composed of a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pot (15 cm height, 15 cm diameter), holding 2.0 kg dry equivalent soil which was adjusted to 60% water-holding capacity, and watered weekly to constant weight with distilled water to compensate for evaporation losses. The pots were covered with nylon mesh (1 mm) to keep the earthworms in the microcosms ( To calculate the survival rates and biomass changes relative to initial values, earthworms were washed in distilled water and again kept on wet filter paper for 48 h to void their guts. Earthworms of each microcosm were freeze-dried and ground into powder ( Nitrate (NO CO Soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) were determined by the fumigation-extraction method. Briefly, soil samples were divided into two subsamples, of which one subsample was extracted with 0.5M K Microbial community structure was determined by analysis of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) based on the method described by Potential extracellular enzyme activities related to total C- and N-cycling were quantified by high throughput fluorometric assay in 96-well microtiter plates ( All statistical analyses were carried out in R Version 3.3.0 ( All earthworms survived after 90 d and their biomass increased from 101.3% to 148.1% with litter amendment compared to their initial weight, but only remained 70.6% of their initial weight in the no litter treatment ( The presence of earthworms increased cumulative CO The MBC:MBN ratio varied two-fold between the no litter treatment and the bagasse fiber treatment in absence of earthworms ( Earthworms changed microbial community structure by influencing the relative abundance of gram positive bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi ( The ﬁnal model adequately ﬁt the data on soil respiration (χ This study focused on how litter chemistry modify earthworm effects on soil C and N turnover as well as associated microbial process. The presence of earthworms translated into higher C-degrading enzyme activity, greater C mineralization and C loss, except in the two low soluble compound and high lignin litter species ( Litter chemistry is a primary controller of earthworm utilization, with litter characterized by low N and high lignin content generally described as recalcitrant. Our study confirmed the significant role of litter chemistry in driving earthworm biomass, as indicated by earlier studies ( Stoichiometric homeostasis of organisms refers to a relatively stable elemental composition regardless of environmental imbalances in nutrient availability ( The changes of different soil C and N fractions revealed clear patterns of the earthworms in acquiring necessary C and/or N under different litter species. Earthworm presence increased N So far, there is still uncertainty regarding to earthworm impacts on soil C pools. Earthworms might concomitantly enhance C stabilization as well as mineralization process ( Earthworms changed the soil C- and N-degrading enzyme activities and microbial community structure, but microbial biomass remained relatively constant in the presence and absence of earthworms. Several studies have shown significant enhancement of microbial biomass by earthworms, while others have found the opposite effect ( It is generally acknowledged that earthworm stimulates the relatively inactive microbial communities (as expressed in soil enzymatic activity) and accelerates soil C and N cycling ( In our study, earthworm showed negligible effects on soil N, while litter chemistry modified earthworm effects on soil C as earthworms reduced POC and SOC under high soluble compounds litter species but no significant effects under high lignin litter species. The result of earthworm tissue stoichiometry also supported the idea that C was under stronger control and associated with higher demand than N. The SEM indicated that earthworm effects on C loss was mainly attributed to earthworm-induced soil fungi abundance decrease, while much less related to C-degrading enzyme activity. However, earthworm controlled microbial C:N acquisition effort as C to N-degrading enzyme activity ratio was significantly increased by earthworms in the low lignin litter species (clover, maize stover and wheat straw), while such effect was reversed in the high lignin litter species ( This work was supported by the The following is the supplementary data related to this article: Supplementary data related to this article can be found at
