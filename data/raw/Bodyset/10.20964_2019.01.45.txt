In this work, the worn-out lead pastes of the seriously softened positive lead plates of a lead acid battery are, for the first time, successfully recovered to be lead powder using a facile method of carbon black-present calcination. Namely, the mixtures containing the worn-out lead pastes and carbon black are calcined at 400 °C for 5 h, and the resultant samples with a carbon black content ( mass ratio ) of 0.3%, 0.6%, 1.2% and 3.1% in the starting materials are labeled as sample a, b, c and d, respectively. The results of XRD patterns reveal that the main component of the worn-out lead pastes is β-PbO2, and after the calcination treatment, Pb-based oxides with relatively lower Pb chemical valence are demonstrated to be the major ingredients of all prepared samples. SEM images strongly indicate that the content of carbon black in the starting materials is a main factor which can greatly influence the morphologies of the resultant samples, and more smaller and rod-shaped particles are displayed in sample b. More importantly, the discharge capacity of sample b is maintained as high as 458 mAh, being very close to that of the fresh industrial lead powder (468 mAh).
