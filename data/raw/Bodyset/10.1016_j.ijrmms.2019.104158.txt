Automated mineralogy combined with environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) was used to determine minerals and mineral-to-mineral contacts in oven-dried and furnace-heated calcite-cemented sandstone. The crack density in oven-dried and furnace-heated calcite-cemented sandstone samples was measured using a MATLAB code written for ESEM image processing. The results showed significantly increased microcrack densities in furnace-heated samples compared with oven-dried samples. Additionally, nanoindentation tests were performed to determine the E

High temperature treatments can cause various physical and mineralogical changes within rocks. Many studies have been conducted to understand the effects of high temperature treatments on the mesoscale mechanical behavior of rocks; however, few studies have been reported at the nanoscale level. Nanoindentation constitutes a very powerful method that investigates the mechanical properties of different materials Even though several investigations have been conducted to understand the effects of high temperature treatment on the mesoscale mechanical behavior of rocks, as far as we know, no data is available at the nanoscale, especially for individual minerals and mineral-to-mineral contacts. To fill this knowledge gap, in this paper, nanoindentation tests were conducted on major minerals and mineral-to-mineral contacts in calcite-cemented sandstone subjected to high temperature treatment. The objective of this research is to link nanoscale mechanical properties to mineralogical observations using a combination of experimental techniques. Variations in mechanical properties of minerals and mineral-to-mineral contacts were correlated with changes in rock microstructure by combining nanoindentation test results with automated mineralogy analysis and environmental scanning electron microscopy. Finally, our findings suggest positive correlations between nanoscale mechanical properties and mesoscale mechanical properties of calcite-cemented sandstone. This study significantly advances our understandings of rock mechanics and fracture behavior. Samples for nanoindentation were prepared from calcite-cemented sandstone rock cores quarried from Monroe County, Indiana. Automated mineralogy analysis was conducted on oven-dried and furnace-heated samples to assess the different minerals and mineral-to-mineral contacts, mineral abundance, mineral association, grain size, and pore percentage in the calcite-cemented sandstone rock. The automated mineralogy analysis was conducted using an FEI QUANTA 650FEG scanning electron microscope equipped with control program SEM control software (xTm version 6). The data were acquired using two Bruker XFlash 6|30 energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometers using a beam stepping interval of 2.1 μm, an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and a beam current of 10 nA. Automated data acquisition and interactive data analysis were performed using iMeasure and iDiscover software, respectively. The polished surfaces of the samples were observed using an FEI QUANTA 600I environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) to identify microcracks, minerals and mineral-to-mineral contacts. ESEM images were taken under a high vacuum chamber pressure of 0.9 Torr after coating each specimen with a thin gold film layer. Ten ESEM images each with an area of 800 μm × 800 μm were selected from oven-dried and furnace-heated samples. These ESEM images were then overlaid on a quantitative evaluation of minerals by scanning electron microscopy (QEMSCAN) color-enhanced particle map for automated mineralogy analysis to identify different minerals and mineral-to-mineral contacts. Observed microcracks were divided into two categories: intragranular (IA) and intergranular (IE). IA microcracks are relatively shorter than the grain diameter and completely lie within the grain The aim of the nanoindentation test is to obtain the nanoscale mechanical properties such as modulus (reduced modulus, Hertz (1881) proposed a contact scenario between a rigid spherical indenter and a flat surface and introduced the concept of reduced modulus, Reduced modulus, Since the geometry of the indenter is known, the area of contact can be determined indirectly using the shape function and the depth of penetration. To determine the area function, a series of indents at various contact depths or normal loads are performed in a sample of known elastic modulus (fused quartz). The contact area, A plot of the calculated area as a function of contact depth is created using TriboScan software that fits the area of contact, The constants from The nanoindentation test was performed using a Hysitron TI950 Triboindenter with a Berkovich diamond tip indenter and a 2-dimensional transducer ( The nanoindentation test was designed to cover different minerals and mineral-to-mineral contacts in rock specimens as shown in The results from the automated mineralogy analysis, including grain size, mass, and area of minerals and phyllosilicates (clays), in oven-dried and furnace-heated specimens are given in The nanoindentation tests were conducted to understand nanoscale mechanical properties ( The load-depth hysteresis curves of oven-dried and furnace-heated mineral grains were compared to identify the effects of different temperature treatments. For quartz and plagioclase minerals, the load-depth hysteresis curves in oven-dried and furnace-heated conditions showed similar trends ( The hardness of minerals and mineral-to-mineral contacts from the nanoindentation tests were calculated using maximum load and area of contact. The size of the contact area at maximum load was estimated from the depth of penetration with the known geometry of the indenter (section  The reduced moduli for minerals in the oven-dried and furnace-heated condition are shown in The reduced moduli for different mineral-to-mineral contacts in the oven-dried and furnace-heated specimens are shown in  Most of the rock forming minerals and mineral-to-mineral contacts in calcite-cemented sandstone revealed significant changes in reduced modulus and hardness due to high temperature treatments. These significant changes can be attributed to high temperature-induced microcracks ( As shown in The increase in mechanical properties of kaolinite can be due to the transformation of kaolinite to amorphous metakaolinite at high temperatures. Shvarzman and coworkers Increases in the density of IE microcracks were observed in the furnace-heated specimens when compared with the oven-dried specimens ( Decreases in mesoscale properties, such as uniaxial compressive strength (UCS), Brazilian tensile strength (BTS), tangent Young's modulus ( ESEM images of oven-dried and furnace-heated calcite minerals taken before loading tests and IA microcrack density measurements exhibited the extent of damages in the calcite minerals due to high temperature exposure ( Nanoindentation, automated mineralogy and ESEM were used to understand the effects of high temperature (500 °C) on the mechanical properties ( ESEM observations and crack density measurements showed noticeable increases in IA and IE microcrack densities in furnace-heated specimens compared with oven-dried specimens. Anisotropic thermal expansions along different crystallographic axes and thermal dissociations of certain minerals may be the primary reasons for the increased IA microcrack densities in the furnace-heated specimens. Differential thermal expansion, presence of impurities and inconsistencies in the orientation of minerals during deposition may be the major causes behind the increased IE microcrack densities in the furnace-heated specimens.
