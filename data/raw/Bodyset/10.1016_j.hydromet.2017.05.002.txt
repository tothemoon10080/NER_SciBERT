Leaching processes have been considered as viable alternatives to produce a clean copper concentrate or collective recovery of copper from chalcopyrite and enargite. Several leaching processes for enargite have been investigated such as acid leaching ( Enargite is a refractory mineral in aqueous media, especially in sulfuric acid ( chalcocite Galvanic interactions among electrical conducting minerals are well-known phenomena. When two of these minerals are in contact with each other in acid electrolyte, a galvanic couple is formed in which the mineral of lower rest potential corrodes at an enhanced rate as the anode of the couple, and the one with higher rest potential acts as the cathode. This interaction accelerates or retards the dissolution of minerals in acid media (   Manganese (IV) oxide (MnO  MnO In this study, we conducted the enargite leaching experiments using MnO Enargite ore used in this study was provided by a mine in the Taiwan. The ore was clashed and sieved to obtain − MnO Carbon black, which is produced by the continuous thermal decomposition of acetylene gas, was provides by Denki Kagaku Kogyou Co. Ltd. Leaching experiments were carried out in 300 Total As concentration was measured with the atomic absorption spectrophotometer equipped with a continuous hydride generator (Hitachi HFS-3). As(III) concentration was determined by the method developed by Solution removed from the flasks by sampling was replaced by adding equal volume of the medium. At the end of the leaching experiment the leachate was filtered, and the residue was recovered and dried at 60 A Cupric sulfate solution and As(V) solution used in this study were prepared by dissolving reagent-grade CuSO Rest potential was measured using electrodes of MnO The steady-state rest potentials of MnO  The leaching rate of As also increased by the addition of MnO Since MnO For the leaching experiments with the addition of MnO   Therefore, in the presence of MnO For The Cu/As molar ratio observed in the leaching experiment in the presence of MnO In order to investigate the adsorption of As(V) and Cu on the MnO   For the additions of 0.3 The Cu/As molar ratio observed in the leaching experiment in the presence of 0.5 Two leaching experiments were carried out using − MnO In order to investigate the effect of MnO In order to evaluate the effect of initial pH on the kinetics of enargite leaching, leaching experiments were carried out by varying initial pH from 0.6 to 1.4 at room temperature. The results in The experiments were carried out by varying stirring speed of a magnetic stirrer from 100  To study the effect of temperature on the enargite leaching, leaching experiments were conducted by maintaining the Erlenmeyer flasks in a hot water bath equipped with a magnetic stirrer at 70 The feasibility of reusing carbon black for treating subsequent charges of enargite and MnO The feasibility of galvanic leaching of enargite was examined using chemical reagent MnO
