A horizontal tubular loop bioreactor (HTLB) was used for production of biomass from natural gas. Hydrodynamic characterizations (mixing time and gas hold up) and mass transfer coefficients were considered in the HTLB (L=2.2m, H=0.4m and D=0.03m) as functions of design parameters, i.e., horizontal length to diameter ratio (L/D) and volume of gas–liquid separator (S) as well as operational parameters, i.e., superficial gas and liquid velocities (U

                     sL). In addition, flow regime in different gas and liquid flow rates was investigated. It was observed from experimental results that U

In average, the amount of oxygen consumption for metabolism is approximately 1.4 times higher than that of methane. In bubble flow regime, the HTLB was used for biomass production, too. A gas mixture of 50% methane and 50% oxygen (based on results of dry cell weight, optical density and doubling time) was the best gas mixture inlet for biomass production.

Mixing time, gas hold up and The microorganism (a A glass made HTLB with an on-line dissolved methane detector was used for the experiments. A schematic diagram of the bioreactor is illustrated in Five streams of mixed gases were used for evaluation of biomass production. Inlet gas flow rates of oxygen and methane were adjusted so that it would provide mixtures from 20 to 60 v% oxygen (five streams with 10 v% interval). When oxygen is present in a gas (such as air), the proportion of methane to oxygen is normally in the range of 5.1–61 volumes of methane to 94.9–39 volumes of oxygen to prevent forming a flammable mixture ( The dissolved methane concentration in the fermentor was determined by a tubing probe based on the concept of Phillips and Johnson ( There have been some attempts in predicting the mixing time based on Bo number (Bodenstein number) ( In addition to methane detector, one probe of dissolved oxygen (DO; with response time of four seconds for 63% saturation) was placed within the horizontal part. Overall gas hold up ( Numerous techniques exist for estimation of flow patterns in gas–liquid flow ( Mixing time ( Eq.

The characterizations of various flow regimes were investigated in the HTLB by changing the gas and liquid flow rates. The observed flow patterns are depicted in As could be seen, best mass transfer coefficient ( Gas liquid mass transfer was characterized in the HTLB for various combinations of two design parameters (  This investigation was supported by National Iranian Gas Company (NIGC).
