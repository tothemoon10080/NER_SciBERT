The process of decomposion of the bastnasite and monazite rare earth concentrates by alkali solutions was investigated. The mixed slurries of the rare earth concentrates and the alkali solutions were calcined at different temperatures in a rotary tubular electric furnace. The effects of calcination temperature on the decomposing ratio of rare earth, the oxidation ratio of cerium, the stripping of fluorine and phosphorous after calcinations, and the adaptability of the process to the mixed rare earth concentrates of different grade were studied. The results showed that the decomposition ratio of rare earth and the oxidation ratio of cerium could reach 95.8% and 93.7%, respectively, while the calcinating temperature was above 300 Â°C.
