Conventional derivative-based algorithms of fitting distribution-like data to exponential-sum functions can be easily trapped in some local minima. This paper is concerned with the development of algorithms of fitting distribution-like data to exponential sums with genetic algorithms. Both binary coding scheme and real-valued coding scheme have been investigated in this research. Experimental results have shown that real-valued coding scheme is more appropriate to the problem of fitting distribution-like data to exponential sums. Testing with real engineering data, it has been demonstrated that the fitting algorithm derived in this paper is quite promising. The fitted exponential-sum models using genetic algorithm can very well describe the measured data. However, for the data with wavy trends, pure exponential-sum functions may not be the best candidate models. More generalized exponential-sum models need to be studied.In scientific research and engineering applications, one quite often encounters a continuous distribution-like problem, which has a monotonically increasing function Fitting data to exponential sums has been studied for a long time. Kammler Conventional fitting algorithms have some fatal disadvantages. The main problem is that solutions can be easily trapped in some local minima Genetic algorithm is a kind of evolutionary approach, particularly useful in solving optimization problems. Because of its random and parallel characteristics, its solution will seldom be trapped in local minima if the algorithm is designed appropriately. This paper will show the application of genetic algorithms in fitting distribution-like data defined in Assume that given experimental data set Let us prove the following theorem first.  Because If A general algorithm fitting data to exponential sums with genetic algorithms may be outlined as below: Begin            End In order to make the whole algorithm work, a right coding scheme has to be chosen first. This will be discussed in next section. Here, assume a coding scheme is already chosen. Assume population size is fixed in the whole searching process, i.e. the number of parents is equal to the number of offspring. We initialize the population by randomly generate chromosomes. The question here is whether we need to use the solutions for exponential number We take Roulette selection scheme to choose mating couples, but we do not allow repeating selection. In other words, a better solution will have more chances to mate with another better solution, every chromosome will certainly have a chance to mate, but no chromosome can mate more than once in each generation. Because we take Roulette selection scheme in this work, RMSE cannot be directly used as a fitness function. We may define the following fitness function: Crossover and mutation strategies are related to coding schemes. They will be discussed in next section. We take Elitist selection strategy to select chromosomes to next generation. After performing crossover and mutation operation, we put parents and offspring together, sort the combined population in descending order by Fitness, and take the first half population as a new generation. This strategy will make sure that the solution of new generation will be not worse than the old generation. Stopping criteria are problem-related. If we have any knowledge about the best exponential number, we may specify one. In that case, the stopping will be just related to the generation number. In this work, for each particular exponential number, we set three stopping criteria. If all chromosomes come to the same, the searching process will stop for this particular exponential-sum model because no driving force exists for any improvement of the search. If the solution has not improved for too long generations, we also stop the search for this particular exponential-sum model because the searching process may have been trapped in some local optima. For some data, they may perfectly fit to some exponential-sum functions. In that case, best RMSE values will be zero, and the search iteration may go forever. Therefore, we need to set an error limit. The error limit represents our expectation of fitting accuracy to a particular problem. If RMSE is equal to or smaller than the error limit, our expectation has been met, and we stop the searching process. If we do not have any knowledge about the best exponential number, we have to search the optima from exponential number one and keep going until we reach the overall best solution. Besides aforesaid stopping criteria for each particular exponential number, we also need to set stopping criteria for the overall searching process. In other words, we need to know up to what exponential number, we can stop our search. One criterion is to check whether the solution is improved for a larger exponential number. If the solution is not improved for the function with more exponentials, the overall searching process should stop. Of course, if RMSE is already equal to or smaller than the error limit, we need to stop the whole searching process too. Two coding schemes are considered in this work. One is binary coding scheme, and the other is real-valued coding scheme. For binary coding scheme, chromosomes are formed by 0 Assume that exponential number is iExpNum. Because of the constrains in For binary coding scheme, uniform crossover approach is adopted for introducing considerable new diversity. Conventional bit-by-bit mutation method is employed. Binary coding scheme is a kind of traditional genetic algorithm. It has several disadvantages. Because the chromosomes consist of only 0 For real-valued coding scheme, a chromosome is composed of real values. Each value in a chromosome will be the representative of a parameter. Because of the constraints of For real-valued coding, we take local crossover approach Which coding scheme is better between above two? Some experimental work has been done in this work. For the test purpose, we take the following four-exponential sum function to generate 3000 points with step length 0.5 starting from 0: For real-valued coding scheme, the following parameter values are set first: population size 200, error limit 0.0001, generation limit for non-improvement search 100 Because all points used in the experiment are exactly on the curve expressed by eq. From the experimental results, we realize that binary coding scheme is not appropriate to the problem of fitting distribution-like data to exponential sums. Especially, if more exponentials are needed for experimental data, binary coding scheme can never be satisfactory. In opposite, real-valued coding scheme is suited to the problem we are dealing with. With such a scheme, one can reach arbitrary accuracy if it exists, and the search of optima is faster, and more reliable. As the result, we take real-valued coding scheme in this research. To this point, we have chosen real-valued coding scheme for fitting distribution-like data to exponential sums. The fitting algorithm with real-valued coding scheme has also been presented. In this section, we shall test the data of some real engineering problems with the algorithm we have developed. Two examples are taken in this test. One is structural characteristic of coal sample Pittsburgh #8 1997, which was measured for predicting liberation spectrum of pyrite and ash from coal. The concepts and measurements of the structural characteristic can be found in Ma For the structural characteristic of coal, we measured the linear intercept length distributions of pyrite, ash and coal. It is required to fit the data to some convenient function forms so that the information from the data can be further employed for the analysis of mineral liberation from coal. Here, we fit the data to exponential sums. The fitted results are shown in For smelting reduction of ilmenite with carbon in molten pig iron, we measured the conversion ratio of reducible oxygen in ilmenite feed reacting with carbon in molten pig iron. The number of data points is 180. The fitted results are  The algorithm of fitting distribution-like data to exponential-sum functions has been developed in this paper. Real-valued coding genetic algorithm has been proven better than binary coding genetic algorithm for the problem of fitting measured data to exponential sums. Testing results with real data from engineering problems have shown that the algorithm developed in this paper is quite satisfactory and promising. For the data with s-shaped trends, general exponential-sum models, instead of pure exponential-sum models, need to be studied.
