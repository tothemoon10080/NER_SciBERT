Flower-like CuO and flower-like CuO/graphene composite were prepared successfully by hydrothermal method. They were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption, temperature-programmed reduction, and thermogravimetric analysis. It is found that the flower-like CuO microspheres, which are composed of CuO nanosheets, possess an average diameter of 4.2 μm and a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 12.6 m2/g. Compared with the flower-like CuO, the obtained flower-like CuO/graphene composite shows an enhanced electrochemical performance with a higher capacity of 603 mA·h/g at 0.1 C rate and 382 mA·h/g at 1 C rate, and exhibits a better cycle stability with a high capacity retention of 95.5 % after 50 cycles even though at 1 C rate.
