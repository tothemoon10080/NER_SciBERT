This paper reports on the results of fine-scale microstructural characterization and isothermal oxidation of hot-pressed TiB2–10wt.% TiSi2 composite. The careful analysis of selected-area diffraction patterns using transmission electron microscopy confirms the presence of Ti5Si3 as a reaction product along with TiB2 and TiSi2 phases. The results of oxidation testing at 1200°C for 12h using a thermogravimetric analyzer illustrate near-parabolic oxidation scale growth characteristics. The oxidation mechanisms are discussed with reference to thermodynamically feasible oxidation reactions. In fact, for high-temperature structural applications, TiB In an earlier study, investigation revealed that TiB In order to prepare TiB The crystalline phases in the starting powders and hot-pressed sample were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Cu For oxidation experiments, 3 The TiB  The variation in weight gain per unit surface area Δ At this point, it is instructive to compare the oxidation test results with the literature data. Tampieri and Bellosi observed that the oxidation kinetics of TiB The XRD patterns of the oxidized surface of the sample reveal the presence only of crystalline rutile (TiO At 1200 In summary, the present research demonstrates that the addition of TiSi The densification of the TiB The HAADF TEM image reveals that the brighter contrasting phases (TiSi It is interesting to note that both the monolithic TiB
