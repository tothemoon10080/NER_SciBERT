The flotation circuit of the Sarcheshmeh copper mine, which processes 40,000 t/d of ore at 0.9% Cu, consists of rougher, cleaning and recleaning stages. Mechanical flotation cells are used in all stages. To investigate the amenability of flotation columns in the plant especially for cleaning and recleaning stages, a column was designed, constructed, and installed at the Sarcheshmeh pilot plant. The pilot plant, which has an identical circuit configuration compared to the plant, can process up to 2 t/h of ore. The overall rate constant of the ore along with the target recovery of 94% were used to size the column. A 26 cm by 550 cm column with two filter cloth spargers and a submerged froth washing system using perforated tubes was constructed. To detect the interface level a 180 cm conductivity probe consisting of 1.5 cm diameter ring electrodes was installed. The tailings flowrate controlled by a variable speed pump was used as the main control variable. The initial testing program revealed that the optimum superficial gas and wash water flowrate were 1.5 and 0.3 cm/s, respectively. It was observed that the cleaning stage grade when using the column could increase by 2â€“3% at constant overall copper recovery.
