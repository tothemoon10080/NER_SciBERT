Lithium iron phosphate platelets are synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method at 160 Â°C using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as structure oriented agent and surface-modified reagent. Different samples were prepared by adding 2-32 vol. % polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the precursor solutions before heating. The structural and morphological properties of the resulting samples were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The amounts of Fe3+ and Li+ were determined by spectrophotometric method and flame AAS, respectively. Results show that by increasing the PEG content from 2 to 8 vol. %, the morphology turned from rectangular platelets to single crystals with well-developed rhombohedral morphology. The electrochemical properties of samples were measured by the cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling. According to the data obtained in this study, increasing PEG content, increase the Li/Fe ratio and enhance the electrochemical performance of LiFePO4/C samples. LiFePO4/C samples, prepared from the precursor solution having 32 vol. % PEG, shows much higher initial discharge capacity in the order of 143 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C discharge rates. The latter represents phase of the ordered olivine structure with a thickness ranging from 550 nm to 2.5 pm. EIS revealed a smaller charge-transfer resistance and higher Li ion diffusivity. The increase in the initial discharge capacity should be correlated with decrease in particle size and increase in the degree of crystallization. Results of this work show that the morphologies of the lithium iron phosphate can be readily controlled by adding various amounts of PEG in the precursor solution. The approach, described in this work, may be used for further optimizing the preparation techniques and microstructures of rhombohedral LiFePO4/C composites.
