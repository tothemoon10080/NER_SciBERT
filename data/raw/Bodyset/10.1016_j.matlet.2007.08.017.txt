Pure ZnO nanopowder was unintentionally prepared by a solvothermal synthesis method in dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent, using zinc chloride, potassium hydroxide, and potassium borohydride as starting materials. The size of the powder synthesized at 180 °C for 48 h is about 35 nm. The nanopowder exhibits much better absorbance in ultraviolet band than commercial ZnO powder and shows a strong violet light emission excited by a 325-nm line. The nanopowder can be pressurelessly sintered to high density (>98% of theoretical density) at 950 °C in atmosphere.ZnO with a wide band gap of 3.37 eV is one of the most important multifunctional materials, which can be used in many fields, such as optoelectronic devices, gas sensors, solar cells and varistors In this work, we used dimethylformamide [DMF, (CH All the chemicals with analytical purity were used. Zinc chloride (12.3 mmol), KOH (12.3 mmol) and KBH XRD analyses were carried out on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with Cu K The powder was uniaxially pressed into pellets (12 mm diameter, ∼  According to redox potentials ( We have also tried to prepare ZnO nanopowder under the same conditions as described in In the following text, we only show the result for the ZnO powder synthesized using ZnCl PL spectrum of the synthesized ZnO powder is shown in The room temperature UV–vis absorption spectrum of the synthesized ZnO powder is shown in  An alternative method to ZnO nanopowder has been presented. The method is simple and convenient. The synthesized powder has good absorbance and photoluminescence property. And the nanopowder can be pressurelessly sintered to high density at relatively low temperature. This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China and Shanghai Pujiang Program.
