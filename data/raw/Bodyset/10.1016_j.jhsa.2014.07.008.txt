Purpose
                  To evaluate the clinical and radiological outcomes of distal radius fractures treated by percutaneous fixation using distal radius–ulna pinning and to assess its effectiveness especially for preventing fracture settling.
               
                  Methods
                  We retrospectively reviewed 18 distal radius fractures (15 AO type A2 and 3 AO type C1). Range of motion and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores were evaluated. We measured radiographic parameters at the final follow-up and compared them with those on immediate postoperative x-rays.
               
                  Results
                  All fractures united and average time to initial healing was 6.9 weeks (range, 6–7 wk). Average follow-up was 29 months (range, 26–43 mo). Average wrist flexion and extension were 70° and 65°, respectively. Average forearm supination and pronation were 82° and 83°, respectively. Average pain score was 1.2 and average Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score was 13. Mean difference of ulnar variance, volar tilt, and radial inclination between immediate and final follow-up x-rays was 0.7 mm, 1°, and less than 1°, respectively.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Percutaneous fixation of distal radius fractures using distal radius–ulna pinning had favorable radiologic and functional outcomes and was effective in preventing fracture settling during initial healing in unstable extra-articular fractures and some simple sagittal split intra-articular fractures.
