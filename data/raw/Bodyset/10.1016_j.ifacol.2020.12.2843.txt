A problem of parameter identification of nonlinear dynamic systems of manufacturing processes on the set of block-oriented models in the frequency domain is considered. Method of parameter identification in steady state at the input sinusoidal influences is proposed. The solution of the problem of parameter identification is reduced to the solution of the systems of algebraic equations by using the Fourier approximation. The parameters estimations are received by the least squares method. The identification method is investigated by theoretical analysis and computer modelling.
