The conversion of three differently sized (<38–165μm) SrSO4 mineral powders into SrWO4 particles with scheelite structure was investigated in highly concentrated NaOH solutions saturated with WO4
                     2− ions under hydrothermal conditions. The treatments were conducted over the range of 150–250°C for several reaction intervals (1–48h). The complete conversion of SrSO4 into SrWO4 under non-stirred conditions was found to proceed at 250°C in 48h in a 5M NaOH solution. SrWO4 synthesis occurred faster using powders with fine particle sizes, <38 and 69μm; in comparison with the 165μm powder. The SrWO4 particle morphology resembled a quasi-octahedral shaped and consisted of fine particles with bimodal particle size between 2.5 and 15μm. The ultimate conversion of SrSO4 into SrWO4 is not affected by the autoclave filling ratio, the conversion proceeding more rapidly during early reaction intervals at a low filling ratio of 22.3% but more slowly at filling ratios above 45%, due to diffusion controlled interfacial molar ratio WO4/OH, this factor varying with the amount of solvent added in the reactor. The SrWO4 particles were produced by a coupled process involving both the bulk dissolution of the SrSO4 powder and the bulk precipitation of SrWO4 in an alkaline solution (5M NaOH) saturated with WO4
                     2− ions. Kinetic analysis shows that the activation energy required for the production of the SrWO4 quasi-octahedral shaped particles was low, in the range 13.13 to 20.0kJmol−1 for those powders with fine particle sizes (<38 and 69μm). The activation energy required to transform the coarser (165μm) SrSO4 particles was of 27.20kJmol−1.Over the last decade, the alkaline earth tungstates (MWO Two main routes are currently used for the production of SrWO Hitherto, most of the related MWO A literature survey suggests that none of the numerous research studies carried out on the synthesis of SrWO Unprocessed polycrystalline celestite (SrSO The inorganic compound of Na The stoichiometric content of Na The amount of the reagent grade chemical Na X-ray powder diffraction analysis was employed to determine the crystalline phases of the reaction products.

Examples found during the synthesis of various functional inorganic compounds from mineral raw materials under hydrothermal conditions were reported by The universal kinetic process outlined by Eq. The effect of the fluid-filling ratio on the kinetics of the hydrothermal conversion of SrSO In regard to the feed particle size, the coarse SrSO Over the years several classes of kinetic models have been proposed for solid–liquid reactions occurring at low temperatures under atmospheric pressure conditions (for example see Experimental conditions for the hydrothermal production of functional inorganic compounds might be classified in terms of uniform system state variables, such feed granulometry, temperature, solvent composition and more dynamic/geometric factors such as dissolution geometry and reaction rim formation that we are unable to specify ab initio. The results of any particular experiment will depend on how these factors interact and their relative importance will determine the selection of a suitable descriptive quantitative kinetic model. In the present case, the optimum reaction rate for forming regular SrWO In general, high correlation coefficients This progressive change in the best fitting model might be explained by the observation that the SrWO With large feed particles, the progressive mechanical instability of more or less complete reaction rims subject to stress cracking and resorbtion is likely to be important whereas with fine particle feed stock ionic diffusion within the liquid accessing a shrinking core will dominate as best described by the F2 function.
