Discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations were carried out – three-dimensional (3-D) for “limited” (∼10−4) plastic strain and two-dimensional (2-D) for the experimentally imposed strain – to investigate the orientation effects on the tensile response of the CRGO steel specimens. 2-D DDD simulations were able to provide qualitative and quantitative estimates of the post-yield tensile behavior of (110) 〈001〉 and (110) 〈1

Plots of From 2-D DDD simulations, data were processed to estimate total ( Experimental observations on lattice re-orientation in the specimens are shown in Plastic deformation and associated slip need to be viewed under the complex processes of dislocation motion and interaction The selected material, the transformer steel or CRGO, appears ideal for undertaking DDD simulations. It has very large, centimeter-scale grains, which are close to ideal orientations. DDD simulations have limitations in representing grain boundaries. Grain boundaries may act as obstacles to dislocation movement and also as sinks or sources for dislocations of opposite type To date a wide body 2-D DDD simulations were carried out because they were computationally efficient as compared to the 3-D DDD calculations.

Computational limitations of 3-D DDD, however, necessitated use of 2-D DDD to experimentally imposed strains. 2-D DDD was able to mimic experimental stress–strain behaviors of both crystallographic orientations. Simulations were able to predict the post-yield hardening observed in the (1 There was good agreement between simulations and experimental observations in the evolution of the total dislocation density and the GND density for the (1 Experiments, in combination with simulations, revealed that the response in the (1 AAB acknowledges support from the Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC under Master Task Agreements No. B599687 and B602391.
