This work evidences the interest of coupling advanced oxidation process (Electro-Fenton reaction) to dynamic filtration technology, using a tubular electrochemically reactive carbon graphite membrane, acting as cathode. This original coupling would be ideally adapted to confine organic pollution while achieving the complete degradation of refractory molecules from wastewater (domestic or industrial). The investigation was carried out using Acid Orange 7 (AO7) as a model pollutant.
                  The electrochemical behavior of the membrane was firstly characterized in batch reactor in term of cathodic reactivity, for H2O2 selective production (in situ production from air supply followed by catalyzed ●OH generation). The influence of various parameters was studied to mark out the experimental domain to be investigated in a dynamic cross-flow reactor for AO7 degradation. In the latter case, a 23 full factorial design of experiments was used to screen the effect of operating conditions on two target responses: AO7 degradation efficiency (%) and kinetic constant value. Results showed that interactions effects between pH, current density and catalyst concentration influenced the AO7 degradation efficiency significantly. Moreover, better kinetic performances were obtained under dynamic filtration conditions, compared to a batch reactor. HPLC–MS analyses enabled elucidating at least six by-products formed throughout the process.Synthetic dyes are widespread environmental pollutants related to many important industries such as textile, printing and cosmetic manufacturing Membrane technologies already play a prominent role in water processing and are effective for water treatment and recycling in different industrial activity segments and ensure the delivery of high quality water in required quantities. The main limitations of membranes processes in the water treatment context are (i) the formation of fouling at the membrane surface, decreasing membranes performance and increasing process energy intensity and (ii) the production of brine streams resulting from a high concentration of pollutants in the retentate, limiting the dilution ratios allowed and affecting process sustainability and economy. Recently, Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have been extensively employed in treating persistent organic pollutants, such as Acid Orange 7 (AO7), in aqueous media To avoid drawbacks encountered during the Fenton process, mainly H Thus, hydroxyl radicals can be generated in solution by the addition of a catalytic quantity of Fe The innovative approach developed in the present work consists of coupling the membrane separation of the pollutants with their mineralization by an EF process in a single step. For this purpose, a porous graphite electrode was used which acted both (i) as a microfiltration (MF) membrane to act as a barrier and (ii) as a cathode for the EF reaction, for continuous pollutant degradation, and, as a consequence,to prevent membrane fouling. The properties of tubular MF carbon membrane were evaluated as cathode in terms of conductivity and electro-reactivity, and as a filtration medium during the degradation of the synthetic AO7 dye, to prove the feasibility of the integrated EF process. Carbon graphite tubular membranes were provided by ORELIS and manufactured by Carbon Lorraine (Belgium). These membranes are characterized by a 14.4% porosity with a bimodal pore repartition (0.16 and 2.8 The commercial dye C Potassium iodide (99%, Merck) and ammonium molybdate (99%, Fluka) were used for the hydrogen peroxide determination as detailed in Hydrogen peroxide concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry using the iodide method (detection limit of ~10 The absorption spectrum of AO7 consists four bands at HPLC––MS was performed with a Waters 2695 pump, an autosampler with 20 HPLC was performed on a Kinetex C18 column (4.6 In a first step, Electro-Fenton investigation wasp carried out in a batch reactor under galvanostatic mode using an EG&G Princeton Applied Research 273 In order to characterize the cathodic behavior of the carbon tube under EF mode, linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) was used. Voltammograms were recorded on the EG&G Model 273 The coupling EF-microfiltration process was investigated using a laboratory scale pilot ( The pilot consists of a stainless steel tank (2 The module is equipped with one stainless steel electrode placed in the axis of the tubular membrane electrically connected as counter electrode (anode). The membrane wall on the permeate side is electrically connected to get the cathodic polarization. All permeate fluxes were measured after the system reached a steady state and a permanent regime to ensure reproducible values. The current was monitored continuously throughout experiments by using a DC (30 The AO7 degradation performances of the coupling process were investigated under different operating conditions, with regard to three key factors governing the Electro-Fenton degradation of AO7: current density, catalyst concentration and pH of the solution As shown in the current density ( the catalyst concentration ( the pH ( Two responses were monitored: the AO7 degradation efficiency at a given permeate volume (60 These responses were related to the coded variables ( The statistical quality of the model is assessed from the estimation of the pure error variance ( The agreement between experimental and predicted values at the points of the cubic 2 Finally, the 2 In the EF process, the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced at the cathode is a crucial parameter and is directly dependent on the electrode characteristics (nature, electrical conductivity, porosity and electro-activity of the surface). One major concern is the optimization of both production and current efficiency involved in the Scans of N Whatever the pH and for O H Considering the batch Electro-Fenton process applied to the AO7 degradation, using the carbon membrane as cathode, it appears that the concentration of the catalyst strongly affects the AO7 degradation when it is present in excess, as evidenced by the series of experiments performed at various Fe Best results of decolorization were achieved at low Fe The Although the confidence intervals are large, it is to be noted that a slight decrease in On the other hand, the degradation rate decreased significantly with the highest concentration of Fe The high rate of AO7 degradation observed might be due to a coupled electrochemical degradation of AO7 sub-products, at the cathode and/or the anode, besides The values of The evolution of the absorption spectrum of AO7 during the Electro-Fenton batch process at different times is shown in As previously mentioned in These results are in total accordance with AO7 analyses recently published As suggested by the evolution of the band at 228 and 254 Porous carbon membranes are well adapted materials to perform efficient pollutants degradation by Electro-Fenton process even though the degradation kinetic is lower than using carbon sponge or carbon felt. In addition, the mechanical resistance of those filtration ceramic membranes makes them good candidates for the coupling of electrochemical degradation technique with baromembrane filtration. This innovative coupled process has never been described elsewhere except the very recent work At this stage of the present study, the MF membrane does not possess pore diameters small enough to act as a real pollutant and by-products barrier (no retention capacity), however the membrane performances are tested as a cathode in the coupled EF/membrane process. Microfiltration (MF) carbon membranes were initially characterized by the determination of both water and AO7 permeabilities. The steady state of the permeate flux (J From the 2 In The effects of factors are stated significant when their absolute value is higher than the calculated confidence interval ( If we compare results between experimental runs 2 ( Interaction diagrams are presented at Diagram 1, in Diagram 2, in The regression polynomial model ( From However, the precision of the model is low due to the high uncertainty of 7.3%. If we test the model validity at 5% of risk, the experimental confidence interval decreases to ±4.6% and the model validation is not guaranteed anymore. Even though our model cannot be a predictive model at this stage of the study, it has allowed us to identify and quantify the effects of the factors on the AO7 degradation performance and also to reveal existing interaction effects between factors. The major findings from this experimental design used are as follows: Increasing the pH of the solution to be treated will affect the AO7 degradation performance (runs 5–7), unless the catalyst concentration is increased together with current density applied, in order to get efficient AO7 degradation (run 8). At sufficiently low values of pH (runs 1–4), the current density is also a key parameter as a too low value applied decreases the AO7 degradation performance, but only if the catalyst concentration is also low (comparison of runs 1 and 2). Therefore, at low pH and low current density applied, the catalyst concentration will have to be increased in order to increase the degradation itself (run 3). The catalyst concentration and current density have no significant effect on AO7 degradation performance if pH of solution is low enough (comparison of runs 2 and 4, then runs 3 and 4). Interactions between current density, catalyst concentration and pH are therefore emphasized. Since the model at the center point is not valid at 5% of risk, this means that the response may be not linearly varying inside the experimental domain studied. In this case, a second-order model needs to be considered and requires the construction a new experimental design. Complementary experiments may be able to reveal the non-linear behavior of the response and will belong to a separate study. As far as the kinetic constant Nevertheless, under identical operating conditions, kinetic constant To conclude, the use of experimental design methodology revealed that several operating conditions applied could lead to efficient degradation of AO7 (runs 2–4, 9–11), provided that appropriate values of Electro-Fenton key parameters (pH, current density, catalyst concentration) are used. The positive consequences could be both economic and environmental (higher flexibility of the process, possibility to work at lower current density and/or lower catalyst concentration). Moreover, we observed that results obtained from  All peak intensities evolve much faster than in simple EF batch process ( Absorption peaks characteristics of aromatic sub-products (228, 254, 310 and 485 At the center point (runs 9–11), amongst the six by-products identified at the early stage of AO7 degradation (5 For run 2, most of these intermediate aromatic compounds were formed and, for run 7, only two predominant intermediate aromatic species could be identified (benzene sulfonic acid (C) and hydroxy-benzene sulfonic acid (D)). Despite the efficient removal of almost all aromatic species at the early stage of the Electro-Fenton treatment, COT analysis showed that a very low mineralization degree could be obtained within 40 The original coupling of electrochemical and transmembrane filtration performances of a porous carbon electrode was successfully demonstrated in this work with the objective of ensuring degradation of refractory organic matter. The AO7 commercial dye was selected as a model of persistent pollutant. The tests performed in dynamic cross-flow filtration led to significantly higher kinetic rates (almost three times) compared to batch reactor, despite a limited electrocatalytic activity of the commercial cathode used for Therefore, to reach both higher efficiency and total confinement of intermediate products, our research is currently focused (i) on the synthesis of new carbon based electrodes to enhance pore volume The presented original combined technology appears to be a very attractive process for the complete degradation of persistent organic pollutant contained in water that cannot be totally removed by conventional methods.
