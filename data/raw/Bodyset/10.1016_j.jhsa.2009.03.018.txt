Forearm instability is a complex problem resulting from traumatic disruption of the forearm stabilizers: the radial head, the interosseous membrane, and the triangular fibrocartilage complex. Dissociation of the forearm unit is often underrecognized and therefore inadequately treated, leading to poor patient outcomes. The goals of this article are to impart an understanding of the forearm anatomy and the current concepts in the diagnosis and treatment options for this complicated problem.
