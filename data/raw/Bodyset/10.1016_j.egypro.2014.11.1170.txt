This paper presents an optimal control model to improve the operation efficiency of a vertical shaft impact (VSI) crushing process. The optimal control model takes the energy cost as the performance index to be minimized by accounting for the time-of-use (TOU) tariff. The control variables in the developed model are the belt conveyor feed flow rate, the VSI crusher rotor feed rate and the bi-flow or cascade flow rate. The effectiveness of the developed model is shown through the simulation results of the crushing process in a coal-fired power plant.
