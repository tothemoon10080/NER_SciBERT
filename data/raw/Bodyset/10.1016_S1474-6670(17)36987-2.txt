The initial study to control the coal rate injected into a slag-cleaning furnace (SCF), based on a soft sensor, was developed at Caletones Smelter, Chile. The old estimation algorithms were only based on discharged cycle average information, leading to large prediction errors. In this paper an improved estimation of the current coal rate is presented, based on valve positions and operating variables. Better control of coal addition into the batch process increases copper recovery from slags and reduces the particulate material pollution. An hybrid expert and fuzzy supervisory control is proposed. Preliminary results are discussed.
