The information extracted from monitoring of rotary blasthole drills helps to optimize the overall mining operation. Rock hardness, drillability, blastability and specific energy of drilling are examples of parameters that have been estimated in the past using measurement while drilling techniques. In order to be able to properly utilize measurement while drilling techniques, it is important to properly collect, analyze and interpret extracted data. This paper deals with processing of measurement while drilling data such as rate of penetration, rotary speed, rotary torque and pulldown force collected from rotary blasthole drills. Different methods are discussed to calculate a true rate of penetration which is the most important monitored drill variable for use in rock mass characterization. Then specific energy of drilling is defined and calculated based on electrical and mechanical inputs and the results are compared. The results show that specific energy of drilling can be estimated using the drill’s primary drive systems’ electrical responses with good accuracy when compared to values based on mechanical inputs.
