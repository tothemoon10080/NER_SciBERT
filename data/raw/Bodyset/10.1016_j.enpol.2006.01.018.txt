This paper proposes a methodology to identify the most relevant productive transactions in terms of CO2 emissions in the most polluting sectors of an economy and applies this methodology to the Spanish case. Emissions can be related to the CO2 emissions intensity of sectors (CO2 intensity factor), to the size of the economy's flows (scale factor), to the input–output productive relationships within an economy (technology-production factor) and to the structure of final demand of different sectors (demand factor). A formal analysis of these factors is carried out by means of an input–output framework combined with a sensitivity analysis. By considering key sectors and relevant transactions in terms of CO2 emissions, the most effective policy measures aimed at reducing CO2 emissions can be identified.A country's CO This paper provides a methodology to identify and assess the sources of CO Applying input–output techniques allows us to trace the direct and indirect CO The developed methodology is applied to the case of Spain. By considering key sectors and relevant transactions in terms of CO Accordingly, the paper is structured as follows. A background on the methodology and the links to existing literature is considered in the next section. The aim of this paper is to propose a methodology to identify the main economic transactions leading to CO   The  We call the last two “structural factors”, since emissions are related to the productive and economic transactions between sectors and economic agents. The emissions-intensity and the technology-production factors are closely related, since both depend on the technical possibilities available in each sector. In turn, the scale factor and the demand factor depend on the behaviour of economic agents, which allocate their resources to obtain the highest welfare level.  Structural decomposition techniques analysing changes in the economic structure is an alternative approach (see Some authors have applied an input–output approach to Spanish CO The aforementioned approaches are based on an analysis of the changes in the vectors of economic flows (assuming that structural relations within the economic system are fixed) or on an analysis of the historical changes of those relations. However, from a policy relevance point of view, the potential changes in the structural relations contributing most to emissions reductions are worth analysing. This allows the identification of the structure of economic transactions more likely to lead to changes in CO The methodology to reach our aim is based on a sensitivity analysis within an input-output framework. The changes in the CO In the input–output framework, the output of an activity branch Technical coefficients can be defined as the ratio between each element of the intermediate transaction matrix and the output of the corresponding activity branch (column): The final demand aggregate The final demand coefficients can be calculated as We can define the vector If we integrate Eqs. The equation above can be rewritten in a matrix form for all sectors. If We can operate with this expression to obtain the following relationship: Let us consider sector Our aim is to identify the impact on the emissions of this key-sector induced by a change in a technical coefficient. It can be expressed as the elasticity of Obviously, the change of the coefficient will transmit its effect through the changes it induces in the Leontief matrix. If we assume a variation of If we calculate all the elasticities for non-zero coefficients in each key-sector, then we can obtain a map with those coefficients whose changes, Ceteris paribus, lead to the largest variations in the emissions of the key sectors (i.e., the most relevant coefficients from the key sectors’ emissions point of view). Hence, this analysis allows us to find those technology elements which are able to reduce the considered key-sector emissions with the smallest effort (i.e., through a small change in the current economic and technical structure). Let us consider sector Obviously, the calculation of this elasticity is immediate. Assuming the variation in As in the case above, we can calculate all the elasticities of non-zero demand coefficients in order to identify those coefficients whose changes, Ceteris paribus, lead to the highest variations in the emissions of the considered key sectors. Hence, this approach allows us to identify those demand patterns with the greatest potential to reduce the key-sector's emissions with the smallest effort. The identification of the most important technical and demand coefficients can help us to propose a mix of policies to effectively reduce the key-sectors’ emissions. These policies should induce technological improvements and behavioural changes in both the key and other related sectors. This approach is applied to the Spanish case in the following section. In this section, we identify the key sectors, the factors behind their high emissions levels and the economic–production relationships most relevant in terms of CO We use the symmetrical Spanish input–output table built by the National Statistical Office (INE) for 1995 (TSIO-95) and the 1995 CO Concerning the final demand matrix, the following economic aggregates per activity branch have been considered: final consumption expenditures by households (FCEH), final consumption expenditures by non-profit organisations serving households (FCENPOSH), final consumption expenditures by government (FCEG), gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), changes in inventories and valuables (CIV), exports to the EU (UEEXP) and exports to other countries (OCEXP). First, those sectors whose contribution to overall CO For each key-sector, we identify whether emissions have a predominantly technological or an output (scale) origin, by analysing the so-called intensive and extensive indicators. We can understand the nature of both indicators by considering Eq. The intensive indicator is based on the  In this context, measures aimed at technological change would be particularly effective in the electricity sector. Measures aimed at improving the intensive indicator in some industry sectors (non-mineral metallic, metallurgy and oil refining) would be limited, since their emissions are mostly related to combustion activities, where the sectors have already made a significant effort in recent years for normal business practice reasons (i.e., to reduce energy consumption and the associated energy expenses)(see The other strategy is to reduce emissions by changing the extensive indicator. In this equation, that fact is pointed out. Finally, an alternative to the change in the key-sector emissions would be to modify the intersectoral structure of relations underlying GDP. In other words, the idea would be to promote a structural change that reduces the weight of the transactions of the key-sectors with either high intensive or extensive indicators, without limiting GDP growth rates. Although identifying these structural relationships is useful to have a more complete picture of the whole anatomy of CO These structural relations leading to the highest reductions in the emissions of key sectors might be technological or behavioural. The former are related to the structure of purchases from productive sectors which are needed to meet the input needs of their productive processes (i.e., the set of In the following subsection, the sensitivity analysis has been used to identify those coefficients whose changes lead to the greatest reductions in the key-sectors’ emissions. By identifying the relative changes in the coefficients leading to the greatest changes in emissions of key sectors, (considering both direct and indirect production linkages), our approach allows an analysis of those changes in the productive relationships within an economic system which lead to significant variations in emissions. An analysis of those elasticities is undertaken in this section. Following the discussion in the previous subsection, key sectors can be distinguished according to whether their high emissions levels are related to high emission intensities (measured by the intensive indicator), to their high output contributions to satisfy the sectoral demand (technical product factor) or to the final demand factor (measured by the extensive indicator). For these key sectors, the most relevant elasticities of each (technical and final demand) coefficient have been identified, by applying Eqs. Care should be taken when interpreting these elasticities. They should be interpreted as the changes in emissions induced by a change in the respective coefficient. For example, the 0.3117 elasticity for the sales of the electricity sector to private consumption (FCEH) means that a reduction of 1% in the share of expenditures that households spend on electricity reduces the emissions from electricity by 0.3%. A double distinction should be made when interpreting the results. First, emissions can be induced by direct or indirect transactions. Secondly, those transactions may have either a technology-productive or a behavioural origin (i.e., technological or final demand coefficients, respectively). When analysing the emissions from key sectors, those changes in the emissions of the respective key sector linked to a change in either transactions of this key sector with another sector or with its final demand components (mainly final household consumption, final consumption by governments, exports and gross fixed capital formation) are considered to be “direct effects”. In contrast, “indirect emissions” are changes in a key sector's emissions induced by changes in either transactions between two other sectors or in the final demand components of other sectors. The greatest emission-coefficient elasticities are those related to transactions between construction and other non-metallic mineral products and gross fixed capital formation related to the construction sector, transactions between the agriculture and the food industry and final consumption in the commercial sector. In general, direct transactions have greater associated elasticities than indirect transactions, but the latter are also very significant. The first result could be expected, but the emissions caused by indirect transactions would be less easy to identify a priori, since they are related to (non-visible) productive linkages between sectors. Our approach allows the identification of these links and the resulting impact on emission changes. Concerning direct emissions, the most important intersectoral transactions leading to the highest elasticities are non-metallic mineral products sold to construction, agricultural products sold to food industry, sales of food industry to hotel business, sales of fishing industry to food industry and sales of paper industry to publishing industry. In turn, the most relevant direct effects linked to a change in its final demand components are final consumption related to the food industry, final consumption in the commercial sector, gross capital formation in the construction industry, final consumption related to electricity, oil and terrestrial transport and exports related to sea transport. Therefore, the results confirm the relevance of the impact of intersectoral and final demand transactions on the CO The most important indirect transactions leading to the highest elasticities are gross fixed capital formation in the construction industry (whose coefficient change induces substantial changes in the emissions of the “other mineral products” sector), final household consumption related to the food industry (causing changes in agricultural emissions) and final household consumption linked to the hotel business (which generates changes in the food and fishing industries). Therefore, transactions leading to indirect emissions also induce changes in direct emissions and confirm the significant role of the construction and food industries. Both are key sectors in the Spanish economy, with complex backward and forward linkages with other sectors. The housing boom experienced in the construction industry is deemed to be one of the factors behind the substantial GDP growth rate in Spain in the last decade (and is expected to continue in the medium term). The food and drinking industry and manufactured tobacco also shows significant forward and backward linkages. By being mostly intermediate products, a change in the final demand of other sectors (hotel business, agriculture and the food industry itself) substantially changes the emissions of this sector. In turn, a change of its final demand affects those sectors which provide intermediate products to the food and drinking industry. Concerning the relevance of transaction with a technology-productive nature versus those with a final demand origin, a common pattern cannot be inferred from the results, i.e., both seem to have the same degree of importance. The following figure summarises the most relevant transactions in terms of CO The aforementioned discussion has shown that a systemic perspective on intersectoral linkages regarding CO On the contrary, certain technoeconomic characteristics of the sectors (availability of mitigating technologies, costs of different technological options, product features, characteristics of the product markets, etc.) make it more technically feasible to reduce in one sector than in another. In this section, a brief complementary analysis of the limitations of each sector to reduce emissions is undertaken focusing on those sectors covered by the EU ETS. Several sources of information have been consulted to identify the real-world limitations of sectors to reduce emissions: interviews with sector experts, written documentation and web-sites (specialised literature, declarations of position by the sectors, etc.). Marginal abatement cost is, of course, a major variable concerning the possibility to reduce emissions. If they are too high, then the sector is unlikely to reduce. Unfortunately, sectoral marginal abatement cost curves are not available in Spain.               Some conclusions can be inferred from this table: In many sectors, the extensive indicator (EI) outweighs the intensive indicator (II), leading to an increase in total emissions (particularly in the “diffused sectors”). Emissions reduction opportunities are available in virtually all sectors. Policy measures should aim at improving the II by stimulating cleaner technology innovation and diffusion by firms (including energy efficiency measures) and the EI by encouraging behavioural change by final consumers. The different challenges, sectors and actors involved in emissions reduction call for a mitigation strategy combining different instruments which tackle different sectors: regulatory (i.e., energy efficiency and solar thermal integration in buildings), voluntary and negotiated agreements (transport sector), information and education (reduction of electricity consumption, increased use of private transport and of energy efficiency appliances), economic instruments (all sectors), etc. These results confirm to a certain extent the results of the quantitative study. They do so except for the transport sector. The reason is related to the impressive growth in the last decade in transport activity and transport emissions, which is only partially reflected when using 1995 data (as in the quantitative study). This is also the case in the residential and commercial sectors. The increase in the standard of living of the Spanish populace in the last decade has led to an increase in emissions linked to certain activities (increasing use of electric appliances and air conditioning, building of malls, etc.). Taking into account the results of the qualitative and the quantitative studies, what can public policy do to effectively tackle these emissions?. Fist, it should also be acknowledged that, while public policy may try to change the behavioural relationships to a certain extent and can also encourage the adoption of cleaner technologies, changing the intersectoral productive relationships to reduce CO Considering this limitation, and the aforementioned results of the quantitative and qualitative studies, the following can be done to mitigate emissions. Policy measures should be predominantly sector-specific, taking into account the technoeconomic particularities of each sector and their contribution to emissions, although economic instruments should also be applied at the multisector level in order to encourage emissions reductions where it is more cost-effective. Therefore, the different sectors and actors involved in emissions reduction as well as their interrelationships call for a mitigation strategy which tackles different sectors and combines different instruments: regulatory (i.e., energy efficiency and solar thermal integration in buildings), voluntary and negotiated agreements (transport sector), information and education (reduction of electricity consumption, increased use of public transport and of energy efficiency appliances), economic instruments (all sectors) etc. Taking into account that the structural relationships are relatively rigid, policy measures should mainly try to improve the intensive indicator in some sectors by stimulating cleaner technology innovation and diffusion (including energy efficiency measures and cleaner fuels) and the extensive indicator by encouraging behavioural change by final consumers. More specifically, the following policies and measures are worth considering in the most relevant key sectors.    On the one hand, although electricity consumption in Spain is below the EU average, it shows convergence towards this average. This is due to several factors: the increase in the number of households, This suggests the relevance of reducing electricity demand through DSM measures aimed at energy efficiency in the residential and commercial sectors. Information and awareness raising campaigns should be implemented, although some of the factors behind the emissions increase are difficult to tackle to reduce emissions. Public policy can also take effective measures to reduce the emissions on the supply side, for instance by promoting changes in the electricity generation mix. A drastic reduction in the use of coal is expected in the next years (−3.66% average annual up to 2012). There will also be a small increase in oil (by 2.34%, below the increase in energy consumption), a high increase natural gas (by 9%) and renewable energy and a small increase in electricity generation from nuclear sources (   In general, measures tackling emissions from this sector should aim at improving the intermodality of transport means (more use of public versus private transport, more use of railroads instead of road transport) and promotion of the use of cleaner fuels. Biofuel production is a clear option as a development alternative for rural places with difficulties in finding alternative development options and in a country with a relatively high share of agriculture. The improvement in the technological energy efficiency of vehicles is beyond the national competencies (ACEA agreement between the European Commission and vehicle manufacturers). Something should also be done to reduce the increasing scale of overall transport activity, which is mostly related to leisure activities, for example through fiscal measures. Care should be taken when doing so, however, given the “hinge” role that transport plays in the economy. All in all, the measures to be proposed should consider the different transport situations (for example, urban transport versus intercity transport). The traditional input–output approach has limitations when tackling the issues considered in this paper. It is based on fixed proportions between inputs and outputs, which disregards substitution possibilities and focus on the analysis of the changes in the flows of economic variables. In contrast, the variable coefficient approach developed in this paper identifies and analyses the implications on emissions caused by a change in the production structure underlying those flows. Our approach also has limitations, however, suggesting directions for further research: Some limitations are related to the data used. First, final demand and technical coefficients have been calculated according to “internal” transactions, disregarding imports. We believe this provides a better reflection of the Spanish economic structure but caution should be taken when interpreting the results. A reduction of a coefficient might be a consequence of import substitution and not of a lower CO Second, 1995 data was used to achieve coherence between data on the Spanish productive structure and on CO Finally, emissions of other GHG apart from CO The policy relevance of this analysis is limited, since no estimate of the costs of emission reductions is available. The variation in costs linked to changes in the coefficients should be considered. Cost-effectiveness is crucial for deciding which sectors to tackle and what mitigation measures to take. Further research should try to integrate the most emissions-intensive production routes with their associated abatement costs. The different coefficients have been treated separately. No overlaps between coefficients have been considered but this possibility cannot be excluded. It could be argued that, by analysing the changes in the coefficients leading to a significant change in the emissions of the sector, our approach fails to consider absolute emissions, i.e., it neglects which changes in the coefficients lead to the greatest variations in overall emissions. However, the problem has been circumvented by choosing those sectors with the largest shares in total emissions (i.e., the key sectors). The choice of these sectors was made considering their contribution to total emissions and, thus, the later are indirectly taken into account because the greatest sector elasticities are also the ones likely to be more significant from the point of view of overall emissions. Finally, the use of CO This paper proposes a methodology combining input–output tables and a sensitivity analysis of the intersectoral production structure to identify the systemic sources of CO This approach has several advantages with respect to other methodologies. It extends the analysis to the final demand matrix and it allows the identification and analysis of the implications on emissions caused by a change in the production structure underlying the flows of economic variables, in contrast to other approaches based on fixed proportions between inputs and outputs, which disregard substitution possibilities. However, ours is not an alternative but rather a complement to other approaches. The empirical study shows the relevance of certain “key” sectors to analyse changes in the Spanish CO The basic quantitative approach has been complemented with a qualitative analysis on the feasibility of carrying out effective mitigation actions in different sectors.
