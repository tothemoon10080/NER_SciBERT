The mechanism of decomposition of calcium inosilicate (CaSiO3) synthesized through chemical deposition method using analytical reagent NaSiO3?9H2O and CaCl2 during the alkali fusion process using NaOH was investigated by Raman spectroscopy in situ, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). The results show that the tetrahedral silica chains within CaSiO3 are gradually disrupted and transformed into nesosilicate with the isolated SiO4 tetrahedra at the beginning of the alkali fusion process. The three intermediates including Ca2SiO4, Na2CaSiO4 and Na2SiO3 appear simultaneously in the decomposition of CaSiO3, while the final products are Ca(OH)2 and Na4SiO4. It can be concluded that there exist two reaction pathways in the alkali fusion process of CaSiO3: one is ion exchange, the other is in the main form of the framework structure change of silicate. The reaction pathway is led by silicate structure transformation in the alkali fusion process.
