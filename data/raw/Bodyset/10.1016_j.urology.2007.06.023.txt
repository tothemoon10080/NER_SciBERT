COM stones are often resistant to breakage using shock wave (SW) lithotripsy. It would be useful to identify by computed tomography (CT) those COM stones that are susceptible to SW’s. COM stones (4-10 mm diameter) were scanned with micro CT (voxel size 18-34 micron) to verify composition (98±4% pure COM, mean±s.d.) and also for assessment of heterogeneity (presence of voids or apatite) by blinded observers. Stones were also scanned using helical CT (Phillips Brilliance 64, 0.67 mm slice width, with reconstruction at 0.33 mm intervals). As with micro CT, heterogeneity was assessed by blinded observers, using high-bone viewing windows. Then stones were broken in a lithotripter (Dornier Doli-50) over 2 mm mesh, and SW’s counted. Observer agreement was assessed using the kappa statistic. For SW number and other data, correlation was assessed using least squares regression, and groups were compared by Classification of stones using micro CT was highly repeatable among observers (kappa=0.81), and also predictive of stone fragility. Stones graded as homogeneous (n=16) required 1874±821 SW/g for comminution, while stones with visible structure (n=25) required half as many SW/g, 912±678 ( COM stones of homogeneous structure require almost twice as many SW’s to comminute than stones of similar mineral composition that exhibit internal structural features that are visible by CT. This suggests that stone fragility in patients could be predicted using pre-treatment CT imaging (which has been shown to disclose remarkable structural detail of stones in the patient). The findings also show that Hounsfield unit values of COM stones did not correlate with stone fragility. Thus, it is stone morphology, rather than x-ray attenuation, which correlates with fragility to SW’s in this common stone type. (Supported by NIH R01 DK59933 and P01 DK43881.)
