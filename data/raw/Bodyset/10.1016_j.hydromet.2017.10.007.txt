Brine from natural salt lakes (salt brine) is an important source of lithium; consequently the recovery of lithium from brine eluates prepared through Li+ adsorption-desorption is economically important. The present paper describes a study on the direct crystallization of Li2SO4·H2O from synthetic and real salt-brine eluates.
                  Thermal evaporation of a sulfate-type synthetic eluate (1400mM Li+, 61mM Na+, 6.7mM K+, 16.7mM Mg2+, and 10.0mM Mn2+), to a degree of concentration (D
                     con) in excess of 13, produced high purity (97%) Li2SO4·H2O crystals in 54% yield. The addition of ethanol to the eluate resulted in an increased yield of Li2SO4·H2O crystals, but these crystals were of lower purity due to the co-precipitation of other metal sulfates.
                  Two types of eluate were prepared by the batchwise adsorption of Li+ from brine followed by desorption with 2M sulfuric acid. Evaporation of an eluate with a Li+ concentration of 1370mM to a D
                     con of 8.6 at 323K produced high-purity (97%) Li2SO4·H2O crystals in 43% yield after the CaSO4·2H2O had been removed at a D
                     con of around 3. The evaporation of the eluate to dryness at 323K followed by rinsing with water afforded Li2SO4·H2O crystals in 83% yield and in 84% purity. This simple evaporation method can be applied to lithium extraction from salt lakes in arid areas.The fabrication of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles is expected to increase the demand for lithium in the coming years. Lithium is obtained from different sources, such as lithium ores (spodumene and petalite) and brine from salt lakes (salt brine) with high lithium concentrations. It is also recovered industrially from brine as lithium carbonate by solar evaporation after the removal of magnesium and sulfate ions. However, the solar method is not favorable for brines that contain large amounts of magnesium and sulfate ions as they co-precipitate with lithium during solar concentration. Several methods, such as adsorption, solvent extraction, have been proposed for the recovery of lithium from such brines; these techniques are summarized in the literature ( Lithium recovery using the adsorption method involves three steps: Li In an actual recovery system, however, H The present study proposes the direct crystallization of Li Fundamental crystallization studies were conducted using synthetic eluates prepared by dissolving different metal sulfates in water; these are referred to as “m1” to “m7” and are detailed in Two eluates, designated as “b1” and “b2”, were obtained from salt brine by the batch adsorption-desorption method; the brine used for Li The chemical compositions of b1 and b2 are detailed in Fundamental crystallization studies were carried out using two methods, namely evaporation and ethanol addition. In the evaporation method, the synthetic eluates were first heated on a hot plate at 373 After evaporation for a determined time, the crystals were collected by filtration, dried at 313 For crystallization by ethanol addition, a known volume of ethanol was added to the synthetic eluates (m5–m7 in Crystallizations from the salt-brine eluates were studied by thermal evaporation at 323 Metal ion concentrations in solution were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) using a Shimadzu E-9000 spectrometer. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were conducted using a Rigaku type RINT-2000 X-ray diffractometer at 40 The densities of the supernatant solutions during thermal evaporation as functions of The weights and metal ion concentrations of the crystals formed are provided in XRD patterns of the crystals are shown in Crystallization was also carried out by the addition of ethanol to the eluates, the results of which are summarized in In the case of synthetic eluate m6, which is a three-fold concentrated solution of m5, the Na The XRD patterns and SEM images of the m6-p1, m6-p2, and m6-p3 crystals, obtained from synthetic eluate m6, are shown in The ethanol-addition method has a disadvantage: it is difficult to obtain high-purity crystals, although higher Li Crystallization from eluates derived from salt brine was carried out at 323 Two Li The results from these crystallization studies are summarized in All peaks in the XRD patterns of b1-p1, b1-p2, and b2-p can be indexed to Li These results indicate that Li On the basis of preceding studies ( The present Li The disadvantage of the present method is the lower yield of recovered Li Further research is required in order to decrease the residual acid levels in the eluates, which will be advantageous for Li Lithium was effectively separated from brine at 323 The authors thank the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) for providing the salt brine.
