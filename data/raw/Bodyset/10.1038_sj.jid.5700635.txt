The classic pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) phenotype derives from mutations in ABCC6. PXE-like phenotypes have been observed in a number of disorders, with no evidence of mutations in ABCC6. Vanakker et al. report PXE-like skin findings in patients with mutations in GGCX critical for Î³-carboxylation of gla-proteins. This report expands the clinical spectrum of PXE-like conditions and also provides potential insights into the ectopic mineralization process.Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), a mendelian autosomal recessive disorder, is characterized by ectopic mineralization of connective tissues in a variety of organs, including the skin, the eyes, and the cardiovascular system, with considerable morbidity and mortality ( Two hypotheses have been advanced to explain the consequences of The PXE cell hypothesis postulates that inactivation of In support of the suggestion that compromised MRP6 activity in resident cells in affected tissues may alter the activity of such cells is the observation that low levels of the protein and mRNA have been detected by immunofluorescence staining, by highly sensitive RNase protection assays, and by multi-round, nested RT-PCR approaches ( The classic PXE is clearly caused by mutations in the Vanakker So, is the condition reported by Vanakker Is the syndrome described by Vanakker  A PXE-like phenotype is reported in patients with pronounced deficiency of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. In summary, although classic PXE was clearly shown to result from mutations in the Jouni Uitto and Qiujie Jiang have been supported in their studies by National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases grants from the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Dr. Uitto is a member of the Medical and Scientific Advisory Board of PXE International, the global nonprofit advocacy organization.
