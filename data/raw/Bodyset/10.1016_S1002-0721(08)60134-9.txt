Separation of rare earth elements by solvent extraction has actually been widely used in various fields from analytical chemistry to hydrometallurgy. A representative ore sample obtained from Kadabora Batholiths-Eastern Desert of Egypt, containing the multiple oxides rare earth minerals: Samarskite, Fergusonite, Betafite, and Pyrochlore, was subjected to sulfuric acid leaching. Different sets of equilibrium loading experiments were carried out on a bench scale for the extraction of rare earths (cerium and yttrium) from the sulfate leach liquor using 8,9-dihydro[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]quinazolin-6(7H)-one {TQ} dissolved in methylene chloride. Stripping was carried out by 20% sodium hydroxide. A rare earth cake was produced by oxalic acid precipitation. Its purity reached 87.3%.
