Radial head and neck fractures are one of the most common elbow fractures, comprising 2% to 5% of all fractures, and 30% of elbow fractures. Although uncomplicated Mason type I fractures can be managed nonsurgically, Mason type II–IV fractures require additional intervention. Mason type II–III fractures with 3 or fewer fragments are typically treated with open reduction and internal fixation using 2 to 3 lag screws. Transverse radial neck involvement or axial instability with screw-only fixation has historically required the additional use of a mini fragment T-plate or locking proximal radius plate. More recently, less invasive techniques such as the cross-screw and tripod techniques have been proposed. The purpose of this paper is to detail and demonstrate the proper implementation of the tripod technique using headless compression screws.
