Mesoporous bioactive glass/hydroxyapatite (MBG/HA) composites with controllable drug/protein delivery have been successfully developed by the mineralization of MBG materials in simulated body fluid (SBF). Using dexamethasone (DEX) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the model chemotherapeutic drug and protein, both DEX and BSA could be loaded in the MBG/HA composites with high loading capacities. Most importantly, the MBG/HA composites exhibited a simultaneously sustained DEX/BSA release behavior, and the DEX/BSA release rates were controlled by changing the mineralization period. It indicated that the mineralization of MBG materials to form the MBG/HA composites offered a simple and effective approach to realize the controllable co-delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs and proteins for bone regeneration.Recently, the use of mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) has received much interest in bone regeneration Studies demonstrated that local co-delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs and proteins, such as osteogenic drugs and growth factors, from the biomaterials could synergistically promote bone regeneration In this study, a simple and effective strategy was developed to prepare MBG/HA composites with controllable chemotherapeutic drug and protein delivery by the mineralization of MBG materials in SBF. Using DEX and BSA as the model chemotherapeutic drug and protein, both DEX and BSA were introduced into the MBG/HA composites in the mineralization process, and their release behaviors were investigated.     N To evaluate the drug/protein delivery, DEX and BSA were used as the model drug and protein to introduce into the MBG/HA composites. The results in In this study, more and more apatite particles were deposited on the surface of MBG particles along with longer soaking time in SBF, and the ion release from the MBG matrix could have damaged the Si–O–Si network, which caused a little decrease of the ordered degree and surface area ( In this study, DEX and BSA as the model chemotherapeutic drugs and proteins were simultaneously and effectively loaded into the MBG/HA composites through the mineralization of MBG materials in SBF containing DEX and BSA. The DEX/BSA-loaded MBG/HA composites exhibited a simultaneously sustained release behavior, and the DEX/BSA release rates decreased with increasing the mineralization period. Therefore, the mineralization of MBG materials to form the MBG/HA composites is a promising strategy to control co-delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs and proteins for bone regeneration.
