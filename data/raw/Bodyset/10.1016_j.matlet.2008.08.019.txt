Investigations on the microstructure of brazed Ti and Cu when using a Zr41.2Ti13.8Ni10.0Cu12.5Be22.5 alloy revealed that mainly Ti-rich compounds were formed at the brazed joint after brazing at 790 °C for 10 min. However, detailed microstructural investigations revealed that the interfacial areas close to the Cu consisted of orthorhombic Cu4Ti, orthorhombic Cu3Ti, hexagonal Cu2TiZr and tetragonal CuTi compounds. The formation of a Cu2TiZr Laves phase at the interfacial areas close to the Cu possibly suppresses a diffusion of Cu into the central areas of the brazed joint due to its characteristics of a high solubility and high melting temperature.Brazing is one of the most promising industrial processes to bond the materials due to its several engineering advantages Recently, it has been pointed out that it is necessary to investigate the microstructure of a brazed joint between dissimilar materials to expand this brazing technique for use in other engineering applications. As a first step, dissimilar specimens Ti and Cu have been selected as a model material when using a Zr High purity Ti and Cu plates with dimensions of 15 mm   In order to investigate the detailed chemical and microstructural analysis results of the interfacial areas as shown in The microstructure of the brazed Ti and Cu when using a melt-spun Zr This research was supported by a grant from the “Development of solid-state joining technology of dissimilar metals using amorphous metastable alloy powders” project funded by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy (MOCIE), Republic of Korea.
