Chemical vapor transport (CVT) process is a simple and efficient method for synthesizing nano-SnO products, and previous references reveal that the CVT process is characterized as high temperature and long synthesis time. Our previous studies indicated that SnO2 was easily reduced to solid-state SnO and then volatilized as gaseous SnO under certain CO-CO2 atmosphere, so that a novel CVT process under CO-CO2 atmosphere was proposed in the present work. The nano-SnOs synthesized by the CVT under 15vol% CO/(CO+CO2) atmosphere were characterized using XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, etc. The results showed that tetragonal structure nano-SnO diskette and sphere with uniform granularity of 50–100nm were obtained with high purity. During the CVT process, CO-CO2 mixed gases could reduce SnO2 to SnO and act as a CVT medium to take away the newly formed gaseous SnO, resulting in the decrease of the partial pressure of SnO. In addition, the nano-SnOs could enhance the SCR deNOx activity of activated carbon (AC), and both the reaction temperature window of AC and the NO conversion were increased if the AC was coated by nano-SnOs.There are a variety of tin oxides in the Sn-O binary system (SnO A chemical vapor transport (CVT) method is commonly used for preparing high quality single crystals which are difficult or even impossible to obtain by other methods Our previous researches indicated that the reactions of SnO SnO is known as a typical p-type semiconducting material with wide energy band gap of 2.7–4.2 In this investigation, a novel CVT process for synthesizing nano-SnOs was conducted at 950 The CVT process was conducted in a horizontal-tube furnace, and the schematic diagram of experimental equipment was shown in The phase constituents of the roasted samples were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max 2550PC, Japan Rigaku Co., Ltd) with the steps of 0.02° at 10° X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experimentation was performed with a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi using an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 The morphological changes of the samples were detected using a scanning electron microscope (ESEM; FEI QUANTA 200; FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) and field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM, FEI Tecnai F30). Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of DeNOx with nano-SnO/AC: nano-SnO/AC was prepared by the CVT process in the equipment of As described in  The generated gaseous SnO was volatilized with the CO-CO SnO can exist stably either as gaseous phase at higher temperature (higher than 900 In order to further investigate the morphology of the CVT products, the SEM and TEM images of Sample B, C and D are conducted and shown in  The morphology of Sample C is shown in  In order to further study the formation mechanism of nano-SnO products by a CVT process, the residues of SnO  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to check the chemical state of the Sample E and Sample F.

Based on Eq. The results in The formation mechanism of nano-SnO was summarized and plotted in Based on the above discussion, Sample D had smaller particle size and lager specific surface area. Hence, Sample D was selected for the SCR deNOx test in this section.
