Level in a thickener can be estimated from the conductance profile (conductance vs depth). Using a conductivity probe the original 0–1 level scale has been calibrated to read “true” level as defined by local practice.In previous communications a “stationary” conductivity probe for level detection, percent solids and inventory determination in thickeners was described ( In application, estimating the level automatically proved difficult due to the inevitable signal noise. The scale was not readily accepted in operations, the preference being for a “true” level (i.e., in length units) as defined by local practice. In this communication we show that the interface scale can be calibrated to give the true level. Local practice is to measure level from the top of the thickener as judged by lowering a weighted rope till it slackens indicating the top of the bed. This defines the true depth,  The inferred level in a thickener using a conductivity probe has been converted from the original 0–1 scale to true depth by calibration against estimates made by accepted local practice.
