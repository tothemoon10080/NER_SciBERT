It is well-understood that the incorporation of recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) in a concrete mix can lead to some impacts on the mechanical properties of the concrete due to the inferior characteristics of the RCAs. In this study, the performances of available code-based and empirical models reported in the literature on recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) mechanical properties (i.e., compressive strength, elastic modulus, flexural strength and splitting tensile strength) are first assessed using extensive experimental data collected from the literature, and the assessments indicate that these models cannot achieve a desirable accuracy for their predictions. Aiming to develop more reliable approaches for predicting RAC’s mechanical properties with higher accuracy and to cover wide-range of influential parameters of RAC mixes in the model expressions, a mathematical approach, namely grey system theory (GST) is used to examine the parametric sensitivity of the mechanical properties of RACs. The results of GST indicate that the overall mechanical properties of RACs depend on the geometrical indices of aggregates and also the concrete mixture proportions. The evaluation of GST also confirms the facts that the effect of RCA is different for the concrete at normal and high strength grades due to the difference in the failure mechanism of the concrete at different strength grades. Finally, multiple nonlinear regression (MNR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) are employed to simulate the mechanical properties of RACs using the key parameters of RAC mixes identified using GST. The results demonstrate that the proposed MNR and ANN approaches can provide more accurate predictions for the mechanical properties of RACs compared to previous models reported in the literature.Recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) produced by crushing old concrete and masonry elements from construction and demolition (C&D) wastes can be reused as an alternative to natural aggregates in structural concrete with the advantage of potentially eliminating the environmental impacts of these C&D wastes A comprehensive review of literature reported on RAC reveals that some empirical models to predict their mechanical properties of RACs have been developed so far based on the available experimental databases. Lovato et al. Applications of artificial intelligence techniques, in which these techniques are mostly machine learning and data-driven modelling approaches, to predict the mechanical properties of concrete has attracted significant research attentions due to their simplicity and reliability, as well as their capability of learning directly from experimental data. Computer-assisted intelligence methods, such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, model tree algorithm, multivariable regression, genetic programming and grey system theory, have been extensively used to evaluate the effects of multi-parametric variables on the compressive strength (i.e., This study aims to investigate the parametric sensitivity of the RAC mixing factors on the mechanical properties of RACs; hence to explore the underlying mechanism governing the actions; and consequently to develop more reliable analytical approaches for predicting the properties of RACs. To achieve these objectives: a set of refined empirical models for the mechanical properties of RACs are developed using an extensive and reliable database and; parametric sensitivity analysis is then conducted using grey system theory to evaluate the effect of a wide range of mixing parameters, in particular the factors associated with aggregate properties, on the mechanical properties of RACs and; having the key mixing parameters and the underlying mechanisms governing the actions identified, the existing database is carefully split based on the different failure mechanisms of RACs and; two advanced approaches based on artificial intelligence, namely multiple nonlinear regression (MNR) and Back-Propagation (BP) neural networks are then applied by considering the identified key parameters in each sub-database and provided more reliable approaches to predict the mechanical properties of RACs. Significantly, the findings of this study will help to provide a set of empirical models with simple forms and higher accuracies to benefit the design of RAC mixes and; identify the influential factors on the mechanical properties of RACs and to explore the mechanism governing the actions and; more scientifically select the inputs for artificial intelligence techniques and; provide more reliable approaches with improved accuracies over those of the existing empirical and numerical approaches for predicting the mechanical properties of RACs; hence these modelling approaches can serve as base for developing future RAC mixes to achieve the designated properties and; improve the physical significances of modelling approaches for concrete materials using artificial intelligence techniques through splitting global database based on the different failure mechanisms of concrete materials prior conducting the machine learning and data-driven approaches and; facilitate the transition of RAC as such a green concrete from lab-based technique to real-world application. The database of RAC used in the present study was compiled from 69 experimental studies and with 650 individual datasets constructed by the fourth author of this paper and its details can be found in Gholampour et al. Code specifications and design standards in different countries and regions provide their own models for predicting the mechanical properties of natural aggregate concrete (NAC) (i.e., ACI 318   The use of newly developed models for predicting the mechanical properties of RACs is presented in Even with the improved performance, due to its empirical nature and simple form, the newly developed models cannot predict the mechanical properties of RACs with high accuracies (see In this study, a numerical model of grey system theory was conducted to determine the parametric sensitivity of the mechanical properties of RACs. The available experimental database (as in Gholampour et al., In order to reduce the numerical fluctuation, the normalization process can be conducted as follows: The grey relational coefficient In GST, grey relational factor ( It is worth noting that the value of  As it has been reported in the existing studies on RACs    It can be seen from Unlike the case of NA-based concrete, the characteristics of RCAs and the critical parameters with wide varying ranges in manufacturing RCA-based concrete have a large variation of predicting the mechanical properties of RACs when employing the code-based and empirical models. Developing expressions based on nonlinear regression analysis on the available experimental database presented in Gholampour et al. Artificial neural networks are a biological-based mathematical model and can be used to simulate the structure or functional aspects of brain-like neural networks (i.e., Hagan et al. BP neural networks mainly contain five portions: The main characteristic of BP neural networks is based on the converse transfer from the output layer to the input layer, and the error of the networks forms in this transfer procedure. Based on the machine learning strategies, the network error can be reduced to an appropriate level by adjusting the weight indexes so as to obtain accurate predictions. Root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used in this study to calculate the network error in BP neural networks, that is: As established in the previous sections, RCA replacement ratio, effective water-to-cement binder ratio, aggregate-to-cement ratio and the ratio of RCA maximum particle size-to-NA maximum particle size are the critical parameters to influence the mechanical properties of RACs. Therefore, in this section, these parameters were selected to form the input matrix for MNR equations and BP neural network models; and meanwhile, each of the mechanical properties (i.e., compressive strength, elastic modulus, flexural strength or splitting tensile strength) of RACs was used as the output matrix (see Table A1 in Appendix presented in Gholampour et al., Based on the regression analysis, the proportion coefficients listed in The available models for predicting the mechanical properties of RACs are not quite accurate in the current literature. With the aim of addressing this research gap and to develop reliable analytical tools, this paper presents three mathematical approaches for the evaluation of mechanical properties of RACs using grey system theory, multiple nonlinear regression and artificial neural networks. A reliable and extensive experimental database containing the results of 332 cubic compressive strength, 318 cylindrical compressive strength, 421 elastic modulus, 152 flexural strength and 346 splitting tensile strength of RACs was used to conduct the parametric analysis and modelling. Based on the results and discussions, the following conclusions can be made from this analytical study: The existing models (i.e., neither code-based nor empirical model) cannot predict the mechanical properties of RACs with desirable accuracies due to the absences of considering the characteristics of RCAs in the code-based models, and the limitation of the existing database in terms of the limited numbers of experimental results and range of parameters in these databases for developing the existing empirical models. An optimized model for predicting the mechanical properties of RACs was developed using an extensive experimental database, and the proposed model shows significantly improved accuracy as well as simpler formulae over the existing models. The evaluation of GST demonstrates that the overall mechanical properties of RACs strongly correlate with the geometrical index of aggregates and the concrete mixture proportions, whereas the effect of RCA replacement ratio on the mechanical properties of RACs is less remarkable but cannot be neglected. These findings suggest that the reuse and recycling of waste concrete as aggregate in structural concrete is a promising technique with proper designing the constituents of concrete. The parametric ranking evaluated by GST also indicates that the parametric sensitivity of RCA replacement ratio is different for the concrete at normal and high strength grades due to the difference in the failure mechanism of the concrete at different strength grades. BP neural network model is capable of predicting the mechanical properties of RACs without determining the accurate functional relationship between independent variables and dependent variables as well as without considering the failure mechanism of concrete. Comparisons also demonstrate that, through the using the influential parameters successfully identified using the GST as the inputs, the predictions for the RAC’s mechanical properties using the proposed MNR equations and artificial intelligence techniques are more accurate when compared with using the existing code-based and empirical methods. Moreover, the predictions of RAC properties using ANN approach show even improved accuracies of predictions over MNR. None. The research reported in this paper was supported by
