The adsorption characteristics of XAD7 ion exchange resin have been established for precious metals and base metals. Synthetic single precious metal solutions as well as mixed solutions containing base metals were tested for adsorption. The effect of chloride strength on equilibrium adsorption was determined for 10.8%, 14% and 17.2% free HCl in the solution.
