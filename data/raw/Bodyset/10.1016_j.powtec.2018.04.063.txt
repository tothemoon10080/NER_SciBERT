The effect of ethanol on the crystallization and phase transformation of MgCO3·3H2O in a MgCl2–CO2–NH3·H2O system was investigated at 40 °C. The obtained crystals were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, and the phase transformation behaviors of the MgCO3·3H2O crystals were studied quantitatively using an established thermal analysis method. The results showed that ethanol played a key role in inhibiting the aggregation of MgCO3·3H2O crystals because the adsorption of ethanol molecules on nuclei surfaces was preferential to that of water molecules. Active Mg2+ ions could be separated from the nuclei surfaces when <30% ethanol was added, preventing secondary nucleation during the crystallization of MgCO3·3H2O. As a result, highly dispersed and stable MgCO3·3H2O rod crystals with smooth surfaces and uniform sizes (length of 25–30 μm and diameter of 2–3 μm) were successfully prepared with 30% ethanol at 40 °C. However, the rod-like MgCO3·3H2O crystals started to dissolve with >40% ethanol in solution, leading to the formation of more stable, flower-like crystals of 4MgCO3·Mg(OH)2·4H2O. The results of this study could contribute to the development of methods for controllable crystallization of MgCO3·3H2O.Nesquehonite (MgCO Ethanol is known to affect the morphologies of crystals and influences their phase stabilities in mixed water–ethanol solutions [ In this study, the effect of ethanol on the crystallization and phase transformation of MgCO MgCl The experimental apparatus used for crystallization experiments was illustrated in XRD analyses of the crystals were performed on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA in the 2θ range of 10°–80°. SEM images were obtained using a JEOL JSM-6701F scanning electron microscope. TGA was carried out using a Pyris 1 thermogravimetric analyzer in the temperature range of 100–800 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C·min Our previous work [ Although the most common magnesium carbonate hydrate prepared from aqueous solution under ambient conditions is MgCO  The above phase transformation is further investigated by TGA. The TG curves in From the above analysis of the XRD patterns and TG curves, it can be seen that increasing the ethanol content from 30% to 60% results in a phase transformation of the obtained crystals from pure MgCO As shown in It has previously been confirmed that significant changes in morphology inevitably occur with phase transformations of magnesium carbonate hydrate [ As shown in With 40% ethanol, however, some flower-like crystals of 4MgCO The above analysis reveals that the agglomeration and secondary nucleation of MgCO The crystallization and phase transformation of MgCO The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the
