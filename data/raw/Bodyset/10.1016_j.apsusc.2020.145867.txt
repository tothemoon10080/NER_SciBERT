Due to its intrinsic band gap, graphene-like MoS2 has been widely studied. It has a significant potential for applications in novel electronic, semiconductor and optoelectronic devices. For comparison, five kinds of explosion mass ratios were used to investigate the detonation exfoliated mechanism of graphene-like MoS2 prepared by the intercalation-detonation method. Bulk WS2 and h-BN powders were also exfoliated by detonation method. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy results show that pure MoS2 nanosheets with hexagonal crystal structure were obtained with the 1:1 detonation mass mixture ratio of picric acid and MoS2 powder. 2:1 detonation mass mixture ratio produced monolayer MoS2 nanosheets, but a spot of MoS2 can also be decomposed to Mo2S3 and S at high explosion temperature. The higher the detonation mass mixture ratio, the more MoS2 is proposed to be decomposed. The 1:1 detonation mass mixture ratio is the most suitable to exfoliate graphene-like MoS2 nanosheets. Bulk WS2 and h-BN were detonation exfoliated to single and few layers nanosheets successfully, showing the promising wide range of application of exfoliation in two-dimensional materials.As one of the most studied two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) materials, graphene-like MoS Due to layered structure and weak Van-der-Waals bonds between the layers, different kinds of “top-down” exfoliation approaches have been explored to prepare graphene-like MoS It is well known that fast decomposition of explosives produces high temperature and powerful shock wave, which can induce exfoliation and synthesis of materials. This kind of detonation method has been used to prepare nanophase materials, such as diamond, graphene, metal oxide nanoparticles, metal nanoparticles and compounds Herein, the detonation exfoliated mechanism of graphene-like MoS Preparation of intercalated MoS Exfoliation was performed next by placing premixed intercalation MoS As-prepared MoS To reveal the behavior and mechanism of detonation exfoliated in graphene-like MoS A new molybdenum hemitrisulfide phase (Mo Adiabatic method (Eq.
