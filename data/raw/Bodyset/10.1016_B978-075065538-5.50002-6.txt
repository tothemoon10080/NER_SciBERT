This chapter focuses on issuers (and to a lesser extent, selling shareholders); their motivations and the benefits that accrue to public companies. One of the most tried and tested method of raising cash is through an initial public offering (IPO). An IPO is the first sale of a company's shares to the public and the listing of the shares on a stock exchange. Many companies need more cash than provided by an IPO. They return to the stock market in secondary offerings or rights issues. The terms “primary offering” or “primary issue,” and “secondary offering” or “secondary issue” are often used to classify the recipient of the proceeds. Proceeds from a primary offering go to the company– it creates and issues new shares for sale to the public. Secondary offerings sell existing shares to the public. Many IPOs combine primary and secondary offerings. In an IPO, the objectives of the vendor, company and investor are complementary, but not identical. The role of the investment bank (managing or sponsoring the offering) is to ensure that a balance of interests is maintained among the three parties. One of the difficulties of administering an investment bank is to manage the inherent conflicts between issuing clients and investing clients.
