Open reduction and internal fixation of displaced calcaneal fractures commonly is performed to reestablish articular surface congruity and anatomic proportions of the calcaneus. The postoperative complication of poor lateral wound healing is one of the most significant and common complications.

                      The association of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables that contribute to wound healing problems with operatively treated calcaneal fractures has been addressed.

                      The association of early wound complications to injury-induced calcaneal anatomic distortion and subsequent operative restoration has not been established, however.
                  Various radiographic parameters have been used to describe calcaneal fractures. Bohler's angle measures the height of the posterior facet and ranges from 25° to 40° and is established from lateral foot radiographs. Previous studies have established the prognostic value of Bohler's angle in predicting morbidity associated with calcaneal fractures.

                      This article analyzes the relationship of Bohler's tuber angle (Bohler's angle) to wound healing complications in a previously studied subset of patients with displaced calcaneal fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation.
