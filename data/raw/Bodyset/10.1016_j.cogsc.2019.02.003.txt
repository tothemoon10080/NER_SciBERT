Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), which has been proposed as a strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and simultaneously offer alternative pathways of production of chemicals, fuels, and materials, remains currently poorly deployed due to the prohibitive cost of the capture and utilization steps. In the present review, we examine the recent advances, challenges, and future opportunities in the field of integrated CCUS and particularly postcombustion capture by liquid sorbents and in situ utilizations or transformations.Mitigating global warming and its impact on ecosystems has become an emergency. It requires drastically reducing the levels of CO From this statement, we herein propose to review and discuss the few reported examples of chemical strategies which have integrated or coupled some of the capture, utilization, and storage blocks, thereby yielding disruptive carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) value chains. Although such a disruptive approach was recently identified as a global priority research direction The most mature chemical technology that is also the only deployed to date for CO Together with the colossal infrastructural investments required, this energy consumption is the major barrier restricting economic viability and preventing the commercial deployment of the amine scrubbing process. The largest shares of energy demand correspond to the water reboiler and the CO With this analysis in mind, innovative capture concepts have emerged from active research programs in the field. These encompass water-lean solvent Discussing sequential CCUS such as enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which commercially uses CO A few commodities and fine chemicals have been produced for decades using CO Chemical transformation from captured CO To fully overcome these issues, integrating the transformation to the capture step appears once again the optimal solution from a carbon and energy perspective. This paradigm should allow chemists to skip the most energy-demanding upstream operations (stripping, compression, and transportation), by the challenge becoming to chemically transform CO CO Several conversions incorporate both CO A major share of the efforts to integrate transformation upstream in the flowsheet of the capture process has focused on the direct reduction products of carbon dioxide: carbon monoxide, formic acid, and methanol. These three compounds are indeed the workhorses of the chemical industry, produced at scale of dozen Mt. Among the many efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of syngas (an industrial mixture of H The earliest attempt to integrate conversion to capture focused on the hydrogenation of CO Compared to other chemicals, CO From these promising studies, current efforts are focusing on the production of C2 adducts, such as ethanol and ethylene, through CO Despite being an undeniable strategy to contribute to GHG mitigation, CCUS is deployed 100 times to slowly to deviate us from the +6 degree scenario we are heading to. The first reason is undoubtedly the prohibitive cost of capture, which censors many possible pathways of subsequent CO Nothing declared. The authors acknowledge the LABEX iMUST (
