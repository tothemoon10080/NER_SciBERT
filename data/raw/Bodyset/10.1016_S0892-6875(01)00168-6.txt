The present paper describes the effect of srubbing on the flotation selectivity of Woxna fine graphite concentrate and the upgrading process of the material. Results show that scrubbing in an attrition machine (with screened sand of −2.9+0.425 mm as attrition media) is an effective way to improve the flotation selectivity, and the material can be upgraded to over 94% from the feed grade of 87–88% carbon by an upgrading process consisting of scrubbing and two-step cleaning flotation.
