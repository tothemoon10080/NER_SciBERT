Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention in recent years due to low cost fabrication as compared to silicon-based and thin film solar cells. Though, platinum is an excellent catalytic material for use in preparation of counter electrodes (CEs) for DSSCs it is expensive. Alternatives to replacement of platinum (Pt) that have been examined are carbon materials, conductive polymers and hybrids. In this work, counter electrode for DSSCs was fabricated using carbon material obtained from graphitization of sucrose at high temperature. A slurry of the carbon produced from sucrose graphitization was made with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a surfactant and a coating was obtained by doctor blading the slurry over the FTO glass substrate. The current density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (V
                     OC) of fabricated cell (area 0.25cm2) was 10.28mAcm−2 and 0.76V respectively. The efficiency of the cell was 4.33% which was just slightly lower than that obtained for similar cells using platinum based counter electrode.In recent years, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted a great deal of attention due to their simple fabrication and low production cost. DSSCs are typically composed of porous nanostructured oxide film on a TCO glass with adsorbed dye molecules as a anode, an electrolyte containing iodide/triiodide redox couple or a suitable hole conductor, and a platinized fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass as the counter electrode Sucrose (Merck, Germany), Polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP (Sigma Aldrich, K-32) and ethanol (Changshu Yangyuan Chemical, China AR Grade) were used for preparation of carbon based counter electrode. Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates (TEC8, sheet resistance 8–9 For the fabrication of counter electrode for DSSC, carbon was produced from graphitization of sucrose at 1400 Titania slurry used for fabrication of photoanodes was prepared by roller milling TiO Carbon produced from the graphitization of sucrose at 1400 Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of counter electrodes was performed at a scan rate of 50 Photo-current–voltage ( Carbon used for preparing the counter electrodes was obtained by graphitization of sucrose at high temperature (1400 The carbon flakes obtained from graphitization were crushed to obtain powder which had a specific surface area of 8 X-ray diffraction pattern of carbon produced from sucrose graphitization is shown in FEG-SEM was used to characterize the surface morphology of the counter electrode after heat treatment at 450 The cyclic voltammograms of platinum and carbon electrodes are shown in The redox reaction  Carbon material produced from graphitization of sucrose at high temperature in flowing argon had a turbostratic graphite structure and the primary particle size of the material was around 25 The Authors are grateful to SAIF department IIT Bombay.
