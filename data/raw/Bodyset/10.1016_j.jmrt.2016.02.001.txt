This study evaluates the influence of the structural changes promoted by a solution heat treatment (ST) on recrystallization and grain growth during annealing of the 3105 Al alloy subject to asymmetric rolling. Optical Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)/X-Ray Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), dilatometric analysis and Vickers hardness tests were used to evaluate the microstructural and mechanical properties. The influence of solution heat treatment on grain growth kinetics could not be evaluated because of incomplete recrystallization due to the chosen annealing parameters.According to the present scenario, searching for greater energy efficiency and weight reduction of metallic structures in aeronautical and automotive industries is a valuable strategy. This weight reduction has been achieved, for example, through the elimination of joining processes, such as welding and riveting. The conformation of parts with complex geometries is an excellent choice to avoid joining, and superplasticity, obtained through materials with ultrafine grains To achieve the superplasticity property in metals, it is not only necessary to obtain ultrafine grain size, but also equiaxed recrystallized grains with high angle disorientation and precipitates or second phase particles Thus, alloys having coarse precipitates, such as most alloys produced at industrial scale, that do not require a rigorous control of these particles, are not suited for the superplasticity applications, because according to Gottstein In order to provide a convenient microstructure, including precipitate size, to enable superplastic behavior on some metals where the solute concentration is slightly above the solubility limit of the solvent, e.g. aluminum and aluminum alloys, a heat treatment is an effective option, providing size reduction of coarse precipitates and complete dissolution of some others. In the broadest sense, this heat treatment consists of heating an alloy at a sufficiently high temperature for a time long enough to achieve a nearly homogeneous solid solution in which almost all solutes are dissolved, so that a single-phase structure is attained This study evaluated the influence of a solution heat treatment (ST), on retardation of the recrystallization and/or retention of grain growth when a 3105 aluminum alloy is subject to asymmetric rolling and recrystallization for different soaking times. This alloy is commonly used in simple applications where size control of the second phase particles is not necessary, but has the potential to improve the mechanical properties of the alloy. The material used for this study was a 3105 aluminum alloy, a 7 Sample nomenclature is as follows: The leading four digits represent the alloy analyzed The following two letters indicate the initial condition of the alloy: AR The last two symbols indicate the final condition of the sample processing: AS Half of the samples were subject to ST in an electric resistance furnace at a soaking temperature of approximately 500 For ASymmetric rolling (AS), was used a pilot-mill with the rolling cylinders revolving at the same speed (1.676 After the AS, small samples with dimensions of approximately 2 For the microstructure characterization, the samples were cut and metallographically prepared according to the following procedures: for Vickers hardness measurements and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)/X-Ray Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), the samples were hot encapsulated with phenolic resin, sanded with 220–4000 mesh SiC paper and mechanically polished with diamond pastes (6 for Vickers hardness measurements in the AS samples subject to AHTR with different soaking times, the samples were cold encapsulated with acrylic resin instead, before being subject to the same grinding and polishing procedure. for X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and optical microscopy, the samples (not encapsulated) were subject to the same sanding step (sandpaper with grain size 220–4000 mesh) followed by electrolytic polishing (solution: 59% CH The microstructure observation by Optical Microscope – OM (Image Pro Plus software) was performed over points associated with ¼ and ½ in thickness cross section associated to the rolling direction (RD). The SEM analysis was performed with the secondary electron detector: 12 The Vickers hardness test (Manufacturer Spectrum Instrumental Scientific LTD) was performed with a load of 100 The dilatometric tests were conducted on a thermomechanical analyzer (TMA); the samples had approximate dimensions of 5 The X-ray diffraction analysis was performed with a Shimadzu diffractometer (XRD-6000) with Co-Kα radiation, standard goniometer, 30 The samples on AR and ST conditions were observed over the regions at ¼ and ½ thickness.  Comparing the microstructures shown in Such microstructural characteristics obtained after the solution heat treatment (ST condition) revealed the reduction of the precipitate volumetric fraction (types 1 and 2). Thus, in materials the ST condition, there is possibly a better microstructural condition for the achievement of superplasticity than in materials in the AR condition, since the precipitates have an important role in the grain growth retention during exposure to high temperatures  In the microstructure observed by SEM ( In the EDS results, the presence of large percentages of Al is due to the Al phase matrix surrounding the precipitate, especially for smaller precipitates, because of the large sampling volume implied by EDS technique. For a point analyzed on AR condition, oxygen was found, which is probably associated with oxides resulting from impurities. According to the literature  As to hardness measurement positions (¼ and ½ of thickness), it can be seen that there were no significant differences. The standard deviations of the hardness measurements were small in regions at ¼ and ½ of thickness, this fact shows that the differences on precipitates sizes, shapes and compositions between ¼ and ½ of thickness ( Comparing the Vickers hardness measurements on AR to ST conditions ( Based on the comparison of the results obtained for the 3105 alloy on AR and ST conditions, it was concluded that the ST was effective.  The differences on Vickers hardness at ¼, ½ and ¾ of thickness are not very significant and perhaps only due to through thickness strain heterogeneity, and consequent grain sizes, because of rolling process characteristics As can be seen in For the samples analyzed in different initial conditions, there is a small decrease in hardness between the AS condition (processed by Asymmetric Rolling) and “15” (AHTR with 15  Such incomplete recrystallization of 3105 alloy in AR or ST conditions might be due to the barriers created by precipitates that controlled the growing of the recrystallized regions Comparing the AR and ST conditions, it can be seen that the decrease of hardness, occurred mainly in the first 15  For the 3105-AR-AS and 3105-ST-AS samples ( In Comparing Δ  Analyzing For the AR conditions, the “Relative Intensity (%)” results ( The peak width can be associated with grain size and/or dislocation densities: a large peak width means smaller grains and/or larger dislocation densities. Thus, as can be seen by dilatometry ( According to the “width at half height”, for the AR conditions, can be inferred that there was a decrease in the dislocation densities for the 3105-AR-AS to 3105-AR-30 condition. This behavior may be associated with the recrystallization process, however, the increase in the dislocation densities for the 3105-AR-30 to 3105-AR-45 condition, may be associated with different levels of dislocations densities from one sample to another before the AHTR, in which even partly recrystallized may have a higher dislocations levels than the previous sample. For the 3105-AR-45 to 3105-AR-60 condition, there were not significant changes in the “width at half height” peak, the small difference may be associated with small errors in the XRD analysis. Therefore, it can be said that there was no change in the dislocation densities. For the ST conditions, it can be inferred that there was a small increase in the dislocation densities in the 3105-ST-AS to 3105-ST-15 condition. This behavior can be explained in the same way as above, i.e., it can be attributed to different levels of dislocations densities from one sample to another before the AHTR. For the 3105-ST-15 to 3105-ST-60 condition, there were not significant changes in the “width at half height” peak, the small difference may be associated to small errors during XRD analysis and therefore it can be inferred that there was no change in the dislocation densities. In general, according to the data presented, ST was able to provide a different structure than that observed on the AR condition. The results of this work lead to the following conclusions: According to the results of Vickers hardness there is a structural homogeneity for the 3105 alloy through the thickness in both conditions, since when a comparison made in the ¼ and ½ thickness positions, there were no significant changes. In the analysis by Optical Microscopy (OM), it can be observed an apparent reduction in size and volume fraction of the precipitates after the solubilization heat treatment. According to the results of dilatometry analysis and Vickers hardness, it can be inferred that for the 3105 alloy (AR and ST conditions), there was not complete recrystallization for the maximum soaking time used in this study (60 Based on the X-ray diffraction peak broadening, comparing the condition AR to ST, possibly the solubilization heat treatment may have caused a change in the microstructure during the annealing heat treatment for recrystallization. It was not possible to evaluate the effect of ST previous condition on retention of grain growth during the AHTR, due to the incomplete recrystallization on the AS samples, but the ST promoted a deceleration in the recrystallization, as can be seen from the values of Vickers hardness and dilatometric analysis.
