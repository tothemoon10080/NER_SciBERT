This study investigates the effect of low surface free energy mineral admixtures (CaF2-dominated fluorite (FL) and fluorine-containing lithium slag (LS)) on the rheological behavior of alkali-activated slag (AAS) pastes. The fluidity, rheological behavior, surface charge properties and surface free energy properties were tested. The interparticle forces based on extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (EDLVO) theory were calculated to understand the mechanism for the rheological behavior improvement. The results revealed that both FL and LS could improve the fluidity and decrease the yield stress and plastic viscosity of AAS pastes. Furthermore, the attraction is manifested by the sum of electrostatic, van der Waals, and Lewis acid-base forces, and this value decreases with increasing LF or LS content, implying that the particle dispersion in AAS pastes is improved. Furthermore, observing flocculent structures captured by the metallographic microscope proves the better dispersion of AAS pastes after adding FL and LS. Moreover, incorporating LS or FL decreases the flexural and compressive strengths of AAS mortars.
