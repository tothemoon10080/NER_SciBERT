This study aims to introduce alternative environmentally friendly compositions for soil-dust suppression. Carbon dioxide was utilized to produce free carbonate (CO3
                     2â€“) by a laboratory electrolysis cell. Different carbonate mineral compositions were then provided by adding Fe2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions to the sodium carbonate solution. Different carbonate minerals were eventually used as soil stabilizing agents for sandy soil-dust suppression. Laboratory tests including unconfined compressive strength (UCS), direct shear test, California bearing ratio (CBR), and permeability tests in addition to field tests were performed to assess the feasibility of using CO2 induced carbonate minerals as soil stabilizing agent. It was found that the UCS and cohesion intercept of the treated specimens increased in comparison with the untreated specimens. CBR rating of the treated specimens indicated a harder surface which resulted in a lower permeability of the treated specimens. The study showed this alternative approach is a promising effort in utilization of CO2 for soil surface stability improvement.
