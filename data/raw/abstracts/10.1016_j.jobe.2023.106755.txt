Microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) has been intensively studied as a potential method to improve engineering properties of soil. However, MICP has limitations due to the introduction of microorganisms and the difficulty of controlling the calcium carbonate crystal precipitation model. This study proposed biomimetic mineralized mortar based on the biomimetic-chemically induced carbonate precipitation (BCICP) method with boric acid as a crystal modifier. Similar to the bacteria in MICP, boric acid can promote the nucleation of calcium carbonate and the adsorption of calcium carbonate on the surface of sand particles. Besides, the boric acid concentration can effectively change the precipitation mode of calcium carbonate. Unconfined compression strength (UCS) test and microscopic characterization were conducted to investigate the mechanism of boric acid modifying calcium carbonate crystal growth and precipitation morphology. The results show that with the increase of boric acid concentration, the reinforcement efficiency of calcium carbonate increased. With the increase of boric acid concentration, the crystalline calcium carbonate changed from a cube-shaped calcite with a smooth surface to a spherical calcite with a rough surface and the coating pattern of calcium carbonate distribution on the surface of sand particles was weakened, while the bonding-filling pattern was enhanced. Besides, the cementing fluid concentration can also affect the reinforcement efficiency of calcium carbonate and with the participation of boric acid, biomimetic mineralized mortar can use the high concentration cementing fluid to achieve effective strength enhancement. This study confirms that boric acid could effectively modify the form and distribution of calcium carbonate between sand particles, and enhance the cementation between calcium carbonate and sand particles.
