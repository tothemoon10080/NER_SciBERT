An improved model of fine particulate matter formation coupling the mechanism of mineral coalescence and char fragmentation under different pulverized coal combustion environments has been constructed. Firstly, based on the theoretical model of char fragmentation and percolation, the included minerals with different types and particle sizes are constructed in the model, and a three-dimensional char particle sub-model is established. And the type, content and particle size distribution of included minerals are introduced as input parameters by using computer controlled scanning electron microscopy (CCSEM) technology. All of the above makes it more in line with the actual distribution of the included minerals. Then a sub-model of char fragmentation is built based on the sub-model of the char particle. And considering the influence of char combustion reaction on the particle formation process and melting characteristics of included minerals, a sub-model of mineral melting coalescence under different combustion environments is established. Finally, based on this improved model, we compared the calculation results with the experimental data and the calculation results of the traditional model. Fully considering the process of mineral coalescence and char fragmentation, which contains the characteristics of different included minerals, the results show that the newly established model has a good fitting effect for the experiment and is closer to the actual process of char particle combustion to generate particles. By the new model, the influence of the factors (mineral content, particle size distribution and porosity) on the formation of particulate matter is preliminarily analyzed.
