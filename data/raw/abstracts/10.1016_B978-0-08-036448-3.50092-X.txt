There is a wide variety of mineral resources in China. Some of these minerals process a fine-dissemination characteristic. The recovering of tungsten and tin from their slimes in mills was begun in China many years ago. In view of the increasing requirements for mineral resources, the recovery of micron and sub-micron particles has become even more important today.
               This paper will describe the latest developments in separation theories and the technologies and equipment for gravity concentration, floculation, high intensity magnetic separation and their combined application to fine particle mineral processing in China. It will also report the new technologies and equipment for treating tungsten and tin slimes, the magnetic-agglomeration gravity separation process for fine grain magnetite, magneto-hydro-static separation (MHSS) for fine diamond and placer gold, pure mineral, dispersion-selective floculation-separation for producing high quality kaolin and diskite concentrates, amongst other examples.
