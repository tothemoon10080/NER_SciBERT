Due to high metal values and raised difficulties in finding superficial deposits, the exploration for mineral resources needs to reach greater depths. To achieve this objective, integrating ASTER and 3D inversion of aeromagnetic can be a useful tool in imaging deep magnetic mineralization hosting-structures. In this study, we present such integrated approach for deep mineral exploration in some promising zones of Gabal (G) Semna region, Eastern Desert (ED) of Egypt. Aeromagnetic data was used to delineate the structures and their relation to ore deposits and ASTER data was utilized for mapping lithological units and the hydrothermal zones. The 3D inversion was employed to imagine the depth and geometry of the magnetized ore bodies in the zones that identified by processing ASTER data. The 3D magnetic inversion revealed that mafic rocks and metavolcanics exhibit high-amplitude magnetic anomalies. High amplitude (positive) magnetic anomalies are joined with the large susceptibilities metavolcanics. Alteration zones in the mafic to basic bedrock and alongside major fault systems are high potential zones that revealed by ASTER image analysis. Aster and aeromagnetic data were used to map and alteration zones surface geology that can host mineralization and the 3D inversion was applied to outline the subsurface extent of these promising areas. This approach can be broadly used for deep mineral exploration in the Egyptian ED and identical areas around the world.
