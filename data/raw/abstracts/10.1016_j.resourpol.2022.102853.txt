This paper explores the flow of embodied minerals of different provinces within China, and the characteristics of embodied mineral supply between the minerals sector of China's provinces and other countries or regions (outside of China) in the world by a nested multiregional input-output (Nested-MRIO) model. Besides, cascading failure is used to simulate the effect of key countries or regions of the nested embodied mineral supply chain network (NEMSCN). The results show that Chinaâ€™s embodied mineral trade is mainly concentrated in the southeast and northeast. Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), European Union (EU), and America are China's three closest trade partners. In NEMSCN, ASEAN, EU, India, USA, Chile, Liaoning, Mexico, Turkey, Anhui, and Brazil are key countries, regions and provinces (key nodes).By cascading failure analysis, we found that if the imports and exports of embodied minerals of these 10 countries, regions and provinces are changed, then the flow of embodied minerals in the entire NEMSCN will change significantly within a certain period of time. The practical significance of this paper is the provision of a theoretical basis and references for the formulation of the related resource and supply security policies.
