To improve metal and mineral recycling technology while minimizing undesirable environmental effects, the Bureau of Mines is devising and evaluating recovery methods for scrap materials that cannot now be processed using conventional techniques. Characterization and leaching tests with chromite tailings, tin recovery from detinning sludges, and conversion of flue dusts generated by the secondary copper and brass industry to zinc oxide are described. Procedures tested include leaching, mineral beneficiation, and roasting. Resource potential and environmental considerations are discussed.
