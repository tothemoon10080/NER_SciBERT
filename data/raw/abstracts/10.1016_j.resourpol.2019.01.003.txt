In June 2017, in Resolution No. 441 of 14 June 2017, the Government of the Czech Republic discussed and approved a document entitled the “State Raw Materials Policy of the Czech Republic in the Field of Mineral Raw Materials and Their Resources.” This completed the process of updating the Czech mineral policy, which had been underway since 2012, and the actual approval process itself took nearly one and a half years to complete. The new state mineral policy and the former mineral policy of 1999 differ mainly in the integration of the raw materials strategy of the European Union, in methods of developing raw materials diplomacy in the Czech Republic, and in promoting the production of traditionally mined minerals. The anticipated effects of the new mineral policy on the energy and heating industries and on the mineral and energy security of the Czech Republic are addressed.
