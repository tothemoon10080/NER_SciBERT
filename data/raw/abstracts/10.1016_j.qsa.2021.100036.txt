Hyperspectral remote sensing technique is a robust technique for the delineation and mapping of hydrothermally altered and weathered mineral deposits. The purpose of present study is to identify, delineate and map the altered zones by AVIRIS-NG Airborne hyperspectral data and validate the output by field survey and analysis of lab spectra. Major lithologies of the study area includes the presence of dolomite, banded iron formation, orthoquartzite, grey phyllite, granites and carbonaceous phyllite. Hydrothermal altered zones are delineated in the study area based on Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) hyperspectral data. FLAASH atmospheric correction was applied to hyperspectral data followed by minimum noise fraction, pixel purity index, n-dimensional visualisation and spectral angle mapper (SAM). SAM classified image was used for identification of altered minerals such as kaolinite, talc, kaosmec, sensitive to the shortwave infrared, whereas iron oxides such as goethite and limonite were distinguished in Visible and Near Infrared region. With the help of alteration minerals, Malachite mineral stains in the study area were identified. Representative rock samples are collected from field and lab spectra generated between wavelength region of 350–2500 nm. ASD spectra and image spectra compared with the USGS spectral library minerals which shows good spectral match with the collected samples. Therefore, it can be concluded that AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data is useful in identification, delineation and mapping of altered and weathered minerals.
