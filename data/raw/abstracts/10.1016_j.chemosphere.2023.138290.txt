To explore the influence of mineral components in bio-sorbent on its adsorption capability towards heavy metal ions, the physicochemical properties of original mushroom residue (UMR) and that treated by an acid solution to remove its minerals (AMR) were comparatively analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR). Then, the adsorption performance of UMR and AMR for Cd(II) as well as the potential adsorption mechanism were investigated. Results show that UMR contains abundant K, Na, Ca and Mg, with the contents of 245.35, 50.18, 1390.63 and 29.84 mmol kg−1, respectively. Acid treatment (AMR) results in the removal of most of the mineral components, exposing more pore structures and increasing the specific surface area by about 7 times to 20.45 m2 g−1. The adsorption performance of UMR is significantly better than that of AMR when they are employed to purify a Cd(II)-contained aqueous solution. The theoretical maximum adsorption capacity of UMR calculated by Langmuir model is 75.74 mg g−1, which is about 22 times of that of AMR. Moreover, the adsorption of Cd(II) on UMR reaches an equilibrium at about 0.5 h, while the adsorption equilibrium of AMR takes more than 2 h. The mechanism analysis shows that 86.41% of the adsorption of Cd(II) on UMR can be attributed to ion exchange and precipitation caused by mineral components (especially for K, Na, Ca and Mg). The adsorption of Cd(II) on AMR mainly depends on the interactions between Cd(II) and surface functional groups, electrostatic interaction and pore-filling. The study indicates that those bio-solid wastes with abundant mineral components can be potentially developed as low-cost and high-efficient adsorbents for the removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous solution.
