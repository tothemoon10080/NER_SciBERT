The efficient utilization of manganese dioxide (MnO2) ore is essential for the sustainable development of manganese (Mn) industry. Confronting the great challenge of chemical engineering scale-up, a commercial fluidized reduction project of MnO2 ore with the capacity of 200,000Â t a-1 is carried out based on deep experimental investigation, extensive kilogram-scale test and detailed engineering design. Compared with other production technologies and equipment, it is proved that the fluidized process shows distinguished advantages of lower energy consumption, higher production efficiency, larger automation degree and less environmental pollution. The comprehensive studies of experiment, modeling, simulation and optimization are required for a more promising development of fluidization engineering in the future.
