The usefulness of alkalinity measurements in biogeochemical process studies is emphasized by two examples concerning aerobic photosynthesis and anaerobic mineralization of organic matter in a tropical lagoon in the Ivory Coast. From changes in alkalinity it is possible to distinguish two photosynthetic periods in the epilimnion, one with a predominance of NO3 assimilation, the other with a predominance of NH4 assimilation.
                  In the hypolimnion, during the stratification period, changes in alkalinity associated with changes in the metabolic products of mineralization (CO2, NH4, SH2) permit one to demonstrate the complete mineralization of the organic matter into CO2 and to estimate the quantities of pyrrhotite and pyrite produced due to SH2 production by sulfate reduction.
