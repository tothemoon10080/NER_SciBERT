This study examined the composition and nutritional value of milk produced by Mithun (Bos frontalis) reared under a semi-intensive model. The study analyzed the milk's chemical composition, fatty acids, amino acids, minerals, and vitamin profiles using standard methods. The results showed that fresh Mithun milk contained (Mean ± SEM) 7.3 ± 0.48 % fat, 10.28 ± 0.13 % solids-not-fat, 4.0 ± 0.05 % protein, 5.7 ± 0.08 % lactose, and had a density of 1.20 ± 0.01 g/mL. Gas chromatography analysis revealed that the milk contained 69.08 % saturated fatty acids and 30.82 % unsaturated fatty acids. The most abundant fatty acids were palmitic, oleic, stearic, and myristic acids, while linoleic 18:2 (n-6) and linolenic acids 18:3 (n-3) were the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids. The study also found that Mithun milk was rich in essential amino acids, with glutamic acid, lysine, proline, and isoleucine being the most abundant. In addition, Mithun milk was found to have a high concentration of vitamins A, D, and E, as well as calcium. The study concluded that Mithun milk could serve as a nutrient-dense food and contribute significantly to the nutritional security of North East India.
