The concentration of phosphate flotation concentrate with P2O5 grade lower than the commercially acceptable phosphate quality was upgraded in the use of tribo-electrostatic technique. The concentration of the flotation concentrate stream was conducted under both triboelectrification and inductive charging mechanism. Mineralogical analysis reveals that the phosphate ore utilized was dominated mainly by fluorapatite, crandallite, wavellite, and with quartz as the major gangue mineral. Flotations concentrate of about 28.87% P2O5 was obtained from the reverse flotation technique, after conditioning the phosphate ore at 80% passing 150μm under Lilafloat. Constant parameters such as −6kV charging voltage, 25kV separating voltage, inlet air, different charger rotary speed and splitter distances were investigated. Commercially accepted grade of 35.50% P2O5 was attained after the second stage of separation with a recovery of 12.26%, another phosphate product of 34.02% P2O5 and 85.19% was also recovered under the same condition. Single stage of separation also shows a significant increase in the grade of the product obtained, with 33.41% P2O5 and 84.07% recovery achievable. The practicability of tribo-electrostatic separation technique for upgrading flotation concentrates resulted in a significant increase in grade for <150μm product that do not meet the viable grade.
