Faults vary in structural style, from simple planes to complex systems composed of fault cores and damage zones. Increased fault complexity results from the interaction of mechanical and chemical processes, including fracture growth, shear, and linkage, and mineral dissolution and precipitation. Although water-rock interaction is traditionally associated with fault rock weakening and shear localization, we investigate processes of fault core widening by water-rock interactions that resulted in quartz precipitation. We combine field and petrographic observations with prior mechanical characterization to assess the impact of alteration and cementation on fault architecture at the Dixie Comstock epithermal gold deposit, Nevada, USA. Mineralized portions of the fault contain strong, thick, silicified fault cores and wide, weak damage zones, with evidence for widening of the core through entrainment of damage zone material and repeated cycles of embrittlement, dilation, and cementation. We present a model of fault zone evolution in which the hydrothermal regimes favoring either alteration-weakening or precipitation-strengthening result in distinct fault zone architecture and mechanical and flow properties of fault systems. Alteration-weakening favors localization of the fault into thinner, clay-rich, low permeability fault cores. Precipitation-strengthening promotes thick, strong, and low permeability fault cores, with mineralization-embrittlement enhancing transient permeability following coseismic failure.
