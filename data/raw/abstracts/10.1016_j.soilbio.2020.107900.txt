Soil organic carbon (SOC) derived from manure increase phosphorus (P) availability by increasing the proportion of organic P (Po) in total P. However, what role SOC plays in the process of converting Po to available P (AP) and who modulates Po mineralization are still poorly understood. In this study, we collected three soil samples under long-term filed treatment with different organic (no carbon, straw, and manure) inputs. By comparing bacterial and fungal lecithin-enrichment liquid cultures, we observed that the lecithin-enriched fungal community showed higher capability for Po mineralization. Using high-throughput sequencing of the field and lecithin-enriched microbial communities, we identified Po-mineralizing taxa in the soil. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that the keystone fungal taxa Geastrum sp. and Chaetomium sp. in the fungal network negatively associated with Po-mineralizing fungal taxa, whereas keystone bacterial taxon was not directly related to Po-mineralizing bacteria. We found labile C limits the growth of keystone fungal taxa and that the addition of lactose enhanced Po mineralization by increasing the abundance of Po-mineralizing fungal taxa. Our results emphasize the importance of soil fungi for Po mineralization in acidic soil from a community perspective and provide evidence that easily degradable C drives Po mineralization and influences P availability through limitation of keystone fungal taxa. Our study gives insight into the biological mechanisms underlying specific organic carbon-induced interactions between fungal taxa and provides crucial information for the facilitation of P cycling.
