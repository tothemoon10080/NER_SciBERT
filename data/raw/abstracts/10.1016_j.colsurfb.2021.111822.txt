Biomineralization approaches have been increasingly adopted to synthesizing advanced materials with superior properties. Nevertheless, the potential influence of inorganic trace elements on the mineralization process of collagen has been rarely reported, despite of the significant progress achieved on exploiting the critical roles of organic polymers in regulating the collagen mineralization. To this aim, the potential roles of Si, Zn and Sr in regulating the mineralization of gelatin-hydroxyapatite (HA) composite fibers have been examined in this study. The results indicated that the incorporation of trace elements not only promoted the biomineralization of gelatin, but also led to drastic change in the mineralization behavior. In particular, the gelatin-SiHA sample showed uniform mineralization predominantly inside the fibers, with nucleation and growth directions along the c-axis of the gelatin fibers. On the contrary, the gelatin-HA sample showed nucleation outside the fibers and spherical mineral crystals on top of fibers, typical structure for heterogeneous nucleation. As the mineralization process proceeded, the gelatin-ZnHA and gelatin-SrHA samples evolved into having similar structure as the gelatin-SiHA sample, despite of showing totally different mineralization behaviors at early time. Overall, the incorporation of trace elements seemed to lower the nucleation barriers, led to a more homogeneous mineralization mode within the fiber region and formation of mineralized structures closer to those in natural bone. Moreover, mineralized samples with trace elements demonstrated improved adhesion and cytoskeleton organization of osteoblastic cells. Such finding would provide important insight for understanding the mineralization process and the optimal design of advanced biological materials.
