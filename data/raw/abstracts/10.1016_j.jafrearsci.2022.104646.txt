The Sikhuran ophiolite complex in Esfandagheh, Kerman province, is considered one of the important chromite mining areas in southern Iran. The complex is comprised of mainly tectonized harzburgite of residual upper mantle, depleted harzburgite, chromitite, dunite, and orthopyroxenite of the transition zone, as well as upper cumulates of ultramafic-mafic rocks. Sulfide disseminations, i.e., pentlandite, chalcopyrite, chalcocite, millerite, and heazlewoodite are hosted by dunite and chromitite in the upper part of the transition zone. The abundance of Base Metal Sulfides (BMS) as interstitials of olivine shows early stage sulfur saturation in Mg-rich magmas. Low Ni contents of ubiquitous olivine indicate that Ni in the primary silicate melt is preferentially concentrated in the sulfide liquid. The high activity of Ni in the melt is evidenced by the dominance of Ni-rich pentlandite and other Ni-bearing minerals from the Sikhuran ophiolite complex. Major and trace element compositions indicate that pentlandite is the main PGE-carrier with ƩPGE up to 44 ppm. Palladium, the most abundant PGE, is partitioned into pentlandite by diffusion of Monosulfide Solid Solution (MSS). The factors affecting this mechanism include the initial concentration of Pd, low compatibility of Pd compared to IPGEs, and decreasing solubility of Pd in MSS with decreasing temperature. Generally, although no detailed studies have been conducted on the occurrence of sulfide minerals in Iran; sulfide mineralization with coarse sulfide minerals in the Sikhuran can be a new perspective for mining companies and economic geologists.
