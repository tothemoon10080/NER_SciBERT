During the Bayer process for alumina production, the molecular formula of the bauxite residue is approximately equivalent to Na2O·Al2O3·1.7SiO2·nH2O. This means that 1 kg of SiO2 in bauxite will produce 1 kg of Al2O3 and 0.608 kg of Na2O in bauxite residue. Thus, the extraction efficiency of alumina is low when processing low-grade bauxite. In addition, it is difficult to utilize bauxite tailings with solid alkali in the structure. In this study, low-grade bauxite was treated using a calcification–carbonization process. A new type of residue (C-C residue) with a different structure from that of traditional bauxite residue was obtained. A cement clinker was prepared with C-C residue as the main ingredient at a dosage of 50%. The experimental results show the alumina extraction efficiency reached 75.82% when processing low-grade bauxite of A/S 3.06 using the calcification–carbonization process. This is higher than the 61.44% of the Bayer process. The main phases of C-C residue [CaCO3, amorphous Ca(4−2x)SixO4, and undecomposed Ca3Al2(SiO4)(OH)4] convert into Ca2SiO4, Ca3SiO5, and Ca2FexAl(2−x)O5 after calcination. The calcification–carbonization process combined with cement production helped low-grade bauxite achieve highly efficient and clean alumina production, which is conducive to the sustainable development of alumina industry.
