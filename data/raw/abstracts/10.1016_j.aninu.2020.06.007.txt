This study was conducted to determine the effect of necrotic enteritis (NE), phytase level and meat and bone meal (MBM) processing on bone mineralization of broilers and litter quality. Ross 308 male broiler chicks (n = 768) were allotted to 48 pens with 16 birds each. There were 8 dietary treatments in a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Factors were NE challenge (no or yes), phytase level (500 or 5,000 FTU/kg), and MBM (as-received or over-processed). Half of the birds were challenged with field strains of Eimeria spp. at d 9 and 108 CFU per mL of Clostridium perfringens strain EHE-NE18 on d 14 and 15. The middle toe, tibia and femur of 2 birds per pen were excised at d 16 and 29 for determination of ash, breaking strength (BS) and bone mineralization. At d 42, all were assessed for hock burns and litter was scored and assessed for dry matter (DM). At d 16, challenged birds had lower toe ash (P < 0.01), femur ash (P < 0.001), tibia ash (P < 0.001) and tibial BS (P < 0.001) than unchallenged birds. At d 16, challenged birds fed high phytase and over-processed MBM had higher toe Mn than those fed low phytase and as-received MBM. At d 29 unchallenged birds fed high phytase and as-received MBM had a higher toe Mn than those fed over-processed MBM. At d 16, a phytase × MBM interaction was detected for femur Zn concentration (P < 0.05), where a higher level of Zn was observed in the high phytase group fed over-processed MBM. At d 16, tibial Ca (P < 0.05) and P (P < 0.05) were lower in the challenged whereas the femur K (P < 0.001), Mn (P < 0.01) and Na (P < 0.001) were higher in the challenged at d 16. At d 42, challenged birds had higher litter DM (P = 0.058) and fewer hock burns than those unchallenged (P < 0.05). In conclusion, NE impaired bone traits but high phytase and over-processed MBM increased bone mineral contents. Cases of hock burns may be lower under NE incidences due to lower livability of birds reducing litter wetness.
