This chapter reports dissolution rates of olivine at 90째C, and discusses the results in the light of the data. The dissolution rate of olivine exhibits a marked dependence on the solution pH. Experimental results at up to 90째C are available from two non-conventional studies, but their dissolution rate values cannot directly be compared to other findings as the specific surface area can only be estimated in both cases. The activation energies, obtained at elevated temperatures, can be compared and fall within the same range set by lower temperature experiments. Results show that the characterization of the dissolution rate of olivine at low temperature can be extended to higher temperature, including its behavior as a function of pH, and is also valid in cases of almost complete dissolution of the particles. To apply this to the aqueous mineral carbonation process, a further extension to temperatures between 150째C and 200째C is necessary where the most promising results have been found.
