The late 1980s and early 1990s have seen momentous world events, particularly in the Middle East and Europe, which have had major effects on world economies and markets. Even before these events it was recognized that the minerals industry was a major user of energy and developments in the industry were beginning to make the operations more energy efficient. This process must continue and research to improve techniques, particularly to make them less demanding of energy, may determine the direction of minerals processing into the twenty first century.
