Sulfide minerals (galena, pyrite, chalcopyrite and sphalerite) were employed as a matrix for glucose oxidase (GOx) immobilization in glucose sensing. Multilayered GOx biosensors were fabricated using glutaraldehyde (GA) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The sensors made using this method were capable of detecting glucose with a linear range of 0.5–90 mM, 0.8–80 mM, 1.0–25 mM, and 1.5–70 mM for galena, pyrite, chalcopyrite and sphalerite, respectively. And the detection limits are 0.06 mM, 0.1 mM, 0.2 mM and 0.35 mM for galena, pyrite, chalcopyrite and sphalerite, respectively. Unlike traditional biosensors, the novel biosensors could detect the glucose under air-saturated buffer solutions. In addition, they showed acceptable reproducibility, good repeatability and applicability. These results indicated that the proposed sulfide minerals are good platforms for enzyme immobilization, thus creating a new and high value application in biosensor for the sulfide minerals.
