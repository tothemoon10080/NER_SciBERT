In mineral processing, accurate characterisation of the mechanical properties of particles of various mineral composite, texture and scale is critical for the development of improved breakage modelling. Additionally, these models should emphasise the primary breakage properties of the particles on the models rather than breakage in test devices that introduce substantial secondary fragmentation events. This work explores the use of the Short Impact Load Cell (SILC) test to investigate the mechanical properties of fabricated 3D-printed (3DP) specimens of single and binary mineral composition, i.e., iron oxide, silica, and layered specimens with both minerals. The fabricated quasi-identical specimens are useful to explore the repeatability and contrast of controlled additively manufactured 3DP specimens and the SILC testing performance. The fracture characteristics of printed quasi-identical specimens were observed using an ultra-high-speed digital camera. The study showed that the specimen properties, such as tensile strength and fracture energy are strongly influenced by the number of beds, bed thickness, and mineral composition. The force–deformation as well as force–time profiles and specimen fragmentation are studied to understand better the variability of the results and the specimen’s physical response to a single impact. The contour of force–time profiles allows for interpretations of how the striker contacts the specimen and to infer the crack initiation and fracture propagation through beds of brittle or ductile material. The use of hierarchical clusters facilitates the analysis as they enhance contrasts and give more insight into breakage and fragmentation, which is worthwhile investigating for natural rocks in the future.
