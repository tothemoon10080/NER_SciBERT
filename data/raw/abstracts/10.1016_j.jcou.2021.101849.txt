Excessive CO2 in the atmosphere can cause the greenhouse effect, increase the environmental temperature, cause natural disasters, and affect the safety of people's lives and properties. This article summarizes how to use CO2 to reduce carbon emissions from the field of building materials, so as to achieve the global carbon neutral goal. In the presence of calcium or magnesium ions, carbon-capturing bacteria can adsorb and transform CO2 into carbonates, and the entire mineralization/carbonization process is environmentally friendly. In the presence of carbon-capturing bacteria and CO2, calcium or magnesium sources in cement-based materials, steel slag, and waste concrete can be mineralized/carbonized to stable carbonates. This microbial method can be used to capture carbon and improves anti-efflorescence and durability of cement-based materials, mechanical properties of recycled concrete aggregates, and suppressing dust on construction sites. These potential applications provide important reference value in large-scale applications of CO2 in construction materials.
