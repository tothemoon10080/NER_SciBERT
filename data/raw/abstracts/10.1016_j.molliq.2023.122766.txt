The knowledge about the adsorption properties of pigments onto different iron oxide minerals is still limited. The adsorption behaviors of three typical pigments, including amaranth (AR), tartrazine (TA), and brilliant blue (BB), onto three iron oxides (ferrihydrite, goethite, and hematite) were investigated. The primary mechanism of their interactions was the electrostatic attraction. The affinities of iron oxides toward any pigment were generally in the sequence of ferrihydrite > goethite > hematite (e.g., the maximum adsorption amounts (q
                     max) of AR onto the three iron oxides were 35.5 mg/g, 11.6 mg/g, and 4.2 mg/g, respectively), which was related to the differences in physicochemical properties of minerals (e.g., specific surface area, surface hydroxyl density, and crystal structure). Interestingly, for a given iron oxide, the pigment-binding capacity of the mineral was in the order of AR > TA > BB. This effect was attributed to variations in pigment molecular sizes and electrostatic interactions between pigments and minerals. The pigment-binding capabilities of iron oxides changed as the solution pH varied. Hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic interactions were the main mechanisms below and above pH > pHPZC (pH value at zero point charge), respectively. Furthermore, adding Cu2+ facilitated pigment adsorption, mainly stemming from the surface-bridging effect. Pigments also enhanced Cu2+ adsorption onto iron oxides due to the decreasing electrostatic repulsion between Cu2+ and particles as well as the complexion between Cu2+ with pigment molecules adsorbed on mineral surfaces. The insightful information demonstrates that ubiquitous iron oxide minerals can affect the fate of pigments in natural environments.
