Biofilms are differentiated microbial communities held together by an extracellular matrix. μCT X-ray revealed structured mineralized areas within biofilms of lung pathogens belonging to two distant phyla – the proteobacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the actinobacteria Mycobacterium abscessus. Furthermore, calcium chelation inhibited the assembly of complex bacterial structures for both organisms with little to no effect on cell growth. The molecular mechanisms promoting calcite scaffold formation were surprisingly conserved between the two pathogens as biofilm development was similarly impaired by genetic and biochemical inhibition of calcium uptake and carbonate accumulation. Moreover, chemical inhibition and mutations targeting mineralization significantly reduced the attachment of P. aeruginosa to the lung, as well as the subsequent damage inflicted by biofilms to lung tissues, and restored their sensitivity to antibiotics.
                  This work offers underexplored druggable targets for antibiotics to combat otherwise untreatable biofilm infections.
