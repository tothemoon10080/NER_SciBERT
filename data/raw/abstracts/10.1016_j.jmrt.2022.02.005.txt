Pandeglang regency has a very potential mining material in the form of Ilmenite rock with high levels of Titanium content of up to 20 percent. The purpose of this study was to determine the microscopic appearance of rocks including the elements, structures, mineral compositions of the rock, and types of minerals as a first step to be able to explore titanium minerals to increase local income, especially in the Pandeglang district. In this study, the analysis of ilmenite rock minerals rich in titanium has been carried out by several testing methods. By elemental analysis using XRF and SEM-EDS, ilmenite rock contains dominant elements consisting of iron (Fe), titanium (Ti), calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), and silicon (Si), with minor elements which contains less than 1% by weight of approximately 14 elements. The results of the petrographic analysis and the phenocrysts hardness show that ilmenite rock consisted of ilmenite, calcite, quartz, and hematite. Analysis using the X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD) shows that the ilmenite rock consists of the ilmenite (FeTiO3) mineral phase of 43.78%, the calcite mineral phase (CaCO3) of 39.53%, the quartz mineral phase (SiO2) of 13.83%, and the mineral hematite phase (Fe2O3) of 2.86%. The extraction results from ilmenite rock using the hydrometallurgical method produce TiO2 Anatase phase raw material with a purity level of 99.3%. It is concluded that this study has succeeded in understanding the identification and analysis of the composition of ilmenite stones from Pandeglang, Indonesia.
