This work proposes a novel insight into the autolytic mineral self-healing strategies for cementitious materials. The autolytic mineral microsphere (AMM) was prepared via the fluidization technique with cement clinker/calcium oxide as the healing substances and amino trimethylene phosphonic acid as the autolytic coating film. The basic characteristics of AMM and its hydration influence on the cementitious composite were analyzed by the laser particle analyzer, calorimetry, X-ray diffractometry and scanning electron microscopy. The autogenous self-healing capacity of the cementitious composite incorporating AMM was assessed by the crack closure, flexural property restoration and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Through the autolytic procedure, AMM regulated the hydration evolution and enhanced the self-healing performance of cementitious composite. The AMM containing cement clinker steadily healed the crack, leading to a well regeneration of fractured structure and restoration of flexural property. The partial substitution of cement clinker by calcium oxide in AMM further increased the crack filling, but induced a volume instability of the cement matrix as well, resulting in the strength decrease under a long-term secondary hydration. The structural alteration of cementitious composite was predominately impacted by the self-healing effect in the first 28Â d re-curing, whilst the volume instability effect played a dominant role subsequently.
