The first record of the carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits in Turkey dates back to the Roman period. The carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits in Turkey are economically important and found in the Aladağlar - Zamantı Province. Mineral exploration and geological mapping through the utilization of the traditional geological method still remain very challenging in many high terrains (High mountains). In this study, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) remote sensing data were used for mapping the carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits in the Yahyali region of Turkey. The Band Ratio (BR), Least square fitting methοd (Ls–fit), Band Ratio Color Composite (BRCC), and Principal Cοmpοnent Analysis (PCA) were used tο map the Pb-Zn mineralization zone. The results of this investigation show the spatial distribution of Fe-Mg – OH/CO3, hydroxyl-bearing and iron oxide minerals. Field work and laboratory analysis were carried out to verify the occurrence of alteration zones and highly prospective locations and to confirm the availability of alteration and potential zones of carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn mineralization in the study area. Spatial correlation and distribution were observed between the previous geological map, active and abandoned mines, and the result obtained from the remote sensing data. Different techniques applied to the Aster data image in this study are recommended fοr carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn and lithological mapping in hostile terrains.
