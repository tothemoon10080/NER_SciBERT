Bone mineral density distributions (BMDDs) are a measurable property of bone tissues that depends strongly on bone remodelling and mineralisation processes. These processes can vary significantly in health and disease and across skeletal sites, so there is high interest in analysing these processes from experimental BMDDs. Here, we propose a rigorous hypothesis-testing approach based on a mathematical model of mineral heterogeneity in bone due to remodelling and mineralisation, to help explain differences observed between the BMDD of human femoral cortical bone and the BMDD of human trabecular bone. Recent BMDD measurements show that femoral cortical bone possesses a higher bone mineral density, but a similar mineral heterogeneity around the mean compared to trabecular bone. By combining this data with the mathematical model, we are able to test whether this difference in BMDD can be explained by (i) differences in turnover rate; (ii) differences in osteoclast resorption behaviour; and (iii) differences in mineralisation kinetics between the two bone types. We find that accounting only for differences in turnover rate is inconsistent with the fact that both BMDDs have a similar spread around the mean, and that accounting for differences in osteoclast resorption behaviour leads to biologically inconsistent bone remodelling patterns. We conclude that the kinetics of mineral accumulation in bone matrix must therefore be different in femoral cortical bone and trabecular bone. Although both cortical and trabecular bone are made up of lamellar bone, the different mineralisation kinetics in the two types of bone point towards more profound structural differences than usually assumed.
