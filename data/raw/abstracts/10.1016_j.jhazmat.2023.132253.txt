Dissolved black carbon (DBC) has been recognized as an important organic matter that influences the photochemical processes of organic pollutants. The excited triplet state (3DBC*) of DBC usually exhibits activity in neutral and basic aqueous conditions, rather than in acidic conditions. In this study, we found the crop (wheat, rice, maize) straw sourced DBC can substantially enhance the photodegradation of triclosan in relatively acidic conditions, and in the presence of ferric minerals (ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite), when exposed to simulated sunlight irradiation. This should be ascribed to the rapid non-reductive dissolution of ferric minerals by DBC, which leads to the generation of abundant hydrogen peroxides (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH) through photo Fenton-like reactions. •OH is the dominant reactive species that leads to triclosan degradation in acidic conditions. Otherwise, triclosan itself is resistant to direct photolysis at pH < 5.0. The triplet state (3DBC*) plays a critical role in accelerating the Fe3+/Fe2+ cycling, which further promotes •OH generation. This study provides a new perspective on the role of DBC in surface water or mineral-water interfaces with acidic conditions and adds a more comprehensive understanding about the environmental implications of the DBC-ferric mineral system in sunlit surface water.
