Diesel particulate matter (DPM) is considered carcinogenic after prolonged exposure. With more diesel-powered equipment used in underground mines, minersâ€™ exposure to DPM has become an increasing concern. This paper used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method to study DPM distribution based on an experiment conducted by the Diesel Emissions Evaluation Program (DEEP) in Canada. Twenty-four cases were simulated where the emissions from both truck and load-haul-dumps (LHDs) were examined. Each vehicle was placed in two stream wise locations, and the vehicles were oriented either facing or with the rear end toward the main fresh airflow. A species transport model with buoyancy effect was then used to examine the DPM dispersion pattern. High DPM regions were identified downstream, around, and even upstream of diesel engines. This can provide guidelines for good working practices and selection of diesel emission reduction technologies underground.
