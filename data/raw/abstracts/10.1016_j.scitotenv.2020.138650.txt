Soluble iron from atmospheric aerosol particles has toxicological effects on ambient environment due to their oxidative potential. However, the dissolution process and factors affecting this process are poorly understood. In this study, by solid phase characterization and aqueous dissolution experiments, we investigated the influence of acids, including HCl, H2SO4 and HNO3, and H+ concentration on iron dissolution rate, solubility and speciation of iron in chlorite, illite, kaolinite and pyrite. The dissolution of iron-bearing clay minerals, i.e. chlorite, illite and kaolinite, was a multi-stage process with a rapid rate in the initial stage and then decreasing rate in the following stages. In contrast, the regularly crystallized pyrite proceeded with an extremely rapid dissolution rate at very beginning and then remained almost constant. In all acid solutions, the dissolution rate was in the order of pyrite > illite > chlorite > kaolinite. H2SO4 was stronger than HCl and HNO3 in the destruction of mineral structures to release iron, while HNO3 dissolved more iron in pyrite (FeS2). High H+ concentration easily destroyed the mineral structures to release the structural or interlayer iron, whereas low H+ concentration increased the proportion of Fe (II) in clay minerals. Non-linear fitting of continuous dissolution models showed that the iron dissolution rates and iron redox speciation as functions of time were well predicted, with r2 > 0.99 for chlorite and illite, and r2 > 0.96 for kaolinite. Oxidative potential analysis proved that the dissolved iron possessed a considerable potential to generate reactive oxygen species.
