Recycling waste activated carbon (WAC) through coal-water slurry (CWS) gasification to produce syngas resources with hydrogen as the main component is a new way to dispose of WAC. The ash fusion temperature, an essential parameter for selecting gasification raw materials, and the mineralogical composition determine the melting and crystallization behavior. In this paper, WAC and CWS were used as the raw materials for co-gasification. The melting properties and mineral phase transformation process of the coal-waste activated carbon-slurry (CWACS) gasification residue were predicted by thermodynamic equilibrium calculations and then experimentally verified. The results showed that the gasification residue yield of CWACS2 was significantly lower than that of CWACS1 due to the different ash contents of WAC in the feedstock. When the gasification temperature was increased to 1200 °C, the gasification residue of the sample melted and adhered to the walls of the porcelain boat. CWACS1 showed ash fusion temperature characteristics related to WAC1, while the ash fusion temperature characteristics of CWACS2 were nearly similar to those of CWS. The liquid phase generation rate of CWACS1 during the ash softening and deformation stages was much faster than that of CWS, while CWACS2 showed more changes in its liquid phase generation rate. Since various types of sodium-containing silicates dominated the minerals in the gasification residue of WAC2, the gasification residue of CWACS2 contained significantly more nepheline than CWS. Clinopyroxene was the main mineral in the gasification residue of CWACS1, and nepheline precipitated in the gasification residue of CWACS2. The mineralogical composition determined by XRD verified the simulation results of thermodynamic equilibrium.
