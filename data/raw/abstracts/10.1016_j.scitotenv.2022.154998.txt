Fertigation using sugarcane vinasse is expected in the sugar and alcohol industries; however, its indiscriminate practice can trigger soil salinization and contamination of water sources. This review article appraises the vinasse use as a precursor material in producing organo-mineral fertilizers. Vinasse use could be an alternative for the increased demand for organo-mineral fertilizers. In that case, the vinasse reuse would be maintained but through controlled practices and lower environmental impact. The state-of-art points to possible advantages associated with the vinasse conversion into organo-mineral fertilizers, such as ease of transport and handling, low variability in its composition, and lower risks of soil and water resources contamination. It has been summarized and critically discussed the past ten years (2011â€“2021, total number papers revised: 175) of research data about vinasse composition, along with the limitations to be overcome in the near future to enable the application of organo-mineral fertilizers. Possible nutrients supplementation beyond those already present in vinasse composition would depend on the crop requirement, and the impact on the soil biota and integrity should be better understood. The aspects discussed along the manuscript would be aligned with circular economy principles, converting a residue (vinasse) into a potential resource for agricultural activities, including sugar and alcohol industries. After all, although promising, obtaining organo-mineral fertilizers from vinasse must be empirically validated and its feasibility proven by comparative studies between fertigation and the use of organo-mineral fertilizers.
