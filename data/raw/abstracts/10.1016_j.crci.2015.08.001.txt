In this study, the optimization and implementation of a homogeneous photo-Fenton process for the decolorization and mineralization of a wastewater containing highly concentrated yellow 5 (E102) dye, resulting from an industry placed in the suburbs of Medellin (Colombia), is presented. Response surface methodology was applied as a tool for the optimization of operational conditions such as initial dyestuff concentration, H2O2 concentration, and UV-radiation power (number of lamps). The decolorization, degradation and mineralization efficiencies were used as response variables. The following conditions were found to be optimal for decolorization and mineralization of yellow 5: UV radiation of 365nm (4W, one lamp), dye concentration of 200mg/L, Fe2+ concentration of 1.0mM, H2O2 concentration of 1.75mL/L, treatment time of 180min, Fe2+ concentration of 1mM and pH=3. Under these conditions (180min), the photo-Fenton process allowed us to reach ca. 100% of color dye degradation, 99% of COD degradation, and 85% of mineralization (TOC). The scavenging effect of the Clâ€“ anion on the photodegradation process was also confirmed.
