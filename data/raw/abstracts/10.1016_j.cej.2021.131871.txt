An original method for direct synthesis of tetramethyl orthosilicate from SiO2 raw minerals and supercritical methanol was developed for the first time in a flow mode. The process promoted by KOH was performed at 270 °C and 100 atm using 3 Å zeolite molecular sieves to shift the reversible reaction toward TMOS formation by removing released water. The equilibrium constant K
                     eq of the reaction was determined as 0.839E-08. Silica gel (100 wt% SiO2), quartz sand (97 wt% SiO2), expanded perlite (73 wt% SiO2) and vermiculite (38 wt% SiO2) were tested as SiO2 minerals. The highest equilibrium concentration of TMOS equal to 20.4 g/L was achieved for silica gel that can be increased using larger amount of water adsorbent.
