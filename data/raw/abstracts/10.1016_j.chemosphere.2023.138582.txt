Sulphide tailings are a major environmental concern due to acid mine drainage and heavy metal leaching, with costly treatments that lack economic benefits. Reprocessing these wastes for resource recovery can address pollution while creating economic opportunities. This study aimed to evaluate the potential for critical mineral recovery by characterizing sulphide tailings from a Zn–Cu–Pb mining site. Advanced analytical tools, such as electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-based energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), were utilized to determine the physical, geochemical, and mineralogical properties of the tailings. The results showed that the tailings were fine-grained (∼50 wt% below 63 μm) and composed of Si (∼17 wt%), Ba (∼13 wt%), and Al, Fe, and Mn (∼6 wt%). Of these, Mn, a critical mineral, was analyzed for recovery potential, and it was found to be largely contained in rhodochrosite (MnCO3) mineral. The metallurgical balance revealed that ∼93 wt% of Mn was distributed in −150 + 10 μm size fractions containing 75% of the total mass. Additionally, the mineral liberation analysis indicated that Mn-grains were primarily liberated below 106 μm size, suggesting the need for light grinding of above 106 μm size to liberate the locked Mn minerals. This study demonstrates the potential of sulphide tailings as a source for critical minerals, rather than being a burden, and highlights the benefits of reprocessing them for a resource recovery to address both environmental and economic concerns.
