The microstructures of mineral materials determine their mineral processing characteristics. Realistic microstructure models are a precondition for simulations of various mineral processing steps. For this reason, a model for simulating the microstructure of minerals that consists of densely packed grains of various phases is presented. It is based on geometrical information and image analysis of planar sections of samples of the material of interest. This includes grain size characteristics, frequencies of mineral components, and information on the spatial distribution of phases. The simulation is carried out by a sequential algorithm, which adds stepwise new grains to an incomplete microstructure. The final result is a tessellation of irregular non-convex grains of spatially variable components. The application of the model is demonstrated for a sample of granite material. A goodness-of-fit test shows that in this case the model is indeed realistic.
