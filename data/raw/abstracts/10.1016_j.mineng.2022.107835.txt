The aim of the research work was to study the specific process of hydrofluoric acid decomposing (Fe,Mn)(Nb,Ta)2O6 mineral structure. In this paper, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), density functional theory (DFT) calculations combining with leaching experiments were used to study the atoms bonding, charge transfer, and energy changes on the mineral/liquid interface and selective dissolution mechanism during the process of leaching (Fe,Mn)(Nb,Ta)2O6 mineral with hydrofluoric acid. DFT calculation results showed that Ta was more easily dissolved than Nb, and Mn was more easily dissolved than Fe. The core energy level spectrum and XPS detection revealed that Nb and Ta at the same site were preferentially leached from the mineral than Fe and Mn at the same site. Therefore, the order of metal dissolution in mineral from difficult to easy was Fe, Mn, Nb, and Ta. ICP results combined with XPS quantitative analysis showed that with the increase of HF concentration, the leaching rate of Nb and Ta increased, and the bridging F existing on the mineral surface would be converted into terminal F, thereby prompting more metal atoms to dissolve away from the mineral surface. Therefore, the dissolution of metals was more likely to occur at higher concentrations of Fâˆ’.
