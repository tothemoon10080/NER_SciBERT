The connection between the Mesozoic metallogenic explosion and the tectonic evolution in the Western Pacific Continental Margin (WPCM) is a frontier theme of research. The wide-scale mineralization is the product of an extensive tectono-magmatic-hydrothermal event where the distribution of mineral deposit types is linked to the geodynamic evolution of the region. The rock associations and ore deposits of Zhejiang Province provide a window into processes of ocean slab subduction, continental marginal magmatism, generation of magmas and fluids, and mineralization in the WPCM. Based on a comparative analysis of the geochemistry, genetic type and metallogenic characteristics of the mineral deposits, we evaluate the relationship between shallow mineralization and deep dynamic processes of the WPCM in the Yanshanian Period (~165–80 Ma). The early Yanshanian mineral deposit types comprise mainly skarn Fe deposits and mesothermal Pb-Zn deposits, and the magmas responsible for metallognesis originate from continental crust and depleted mantle, produced by flat subduction of the Pacific Plate and the foundering of the subducted oceanic slab. Porphyry Mo deposits are the main deposit type of the mid-Yanshanian, and the mineralized intrusions were derived from melting of old continental crust and mixing within mantle-derived magmas produced by destruction and thinning of the lithospheric mantle by mantle melting above a steep subduction zone. The late Yanshanian deposit types are mainly greisen W-Sn deposits, and the magmas producing this style of mineralization originated from small volumes of mantle-derived magmas produced during eastward retreat of the subduction-related trench.
