Despite its low proportion within asphalt mixture, it is widely believed that mineral filler plays a critical role on its pavement performances and in particular fracture resistance, which in turn depends on its physicochemical properties. In this study, physicochemical characterization of five mineral fillers was first completed. It was followed by three types of cracking resistance tests at intermediate temperature 20 â„ƒ on one control asphalt and five mastics. It was found that both specific surface area and chemical nature of mineral filler play a significant role on the fracture resistance of the corresponding mastics.
