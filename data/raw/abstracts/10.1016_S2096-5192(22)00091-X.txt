The Tiegelongnan Cu (Au, Ag) deposit in central Tibet contains more than 10 Mt of copper ranking 29th in the world. It is characterized by typical porphyry-epithermal alteration and mineralization. In order to improve the understanding of porphyry-epithermal copper deposit in Tibet, new zircon U-Pb age and sulfur isotope data along with published data in the Tiegelongnan are presented to investigate the formation and preservation mechanism. Ore-related intrusive rocks in the Tiegelongnan including Early Cretaceous (about 120 Ma) granodiorite porphyry and diorite porphyry are closely related to the northward subduction of Bangongco-Nujiang ocean. Sulfur mainly comes from deep magma, and ore-forming fluid is affected by both magmatic and meteoric water. The metallogenic setting of Tiegelongnan is consistent with those of Andean porphyry copper deposits in South America. The cover of the Meiriqiecuo Formation volcanic rocks, Lhasa-Qiangtang collision and India-Eurasian collision have significance in the preservation and uplift of the deposit. The formation, preservation and discovery of Tiegelongnan play an important role in exploration of ancient porphyry-epithermal deposits in Tibet.
