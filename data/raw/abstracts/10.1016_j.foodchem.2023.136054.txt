The recovery of antioxidants and minerals as well as the content of contaminants of rainbow trout and sole side streams (head, skin and viscera) extracts obtained by pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) were evaluated. Then, the effect of the gastrointestinal digestion was tested. No mycotoxins were detected in the extracts, while heavy metals contents (mg/kg) were up to 2.9 (As), 0.054 (Cd), 0.16 (Hg) and 0.073 (Pb), being below maximum legislated limits. A positive effect of PLE was found for the antioxidant capacity recovery, being the oxygen radical capacity of sole head and skin extracts significantly enhanced after digestion (∼3.8 times). PLE significantly increased Mg, Fe, Zn, Se and P (KPLE > 1) contents of rainbow trout side streams, Zn (KPLE5.97) and Fe (KPLE 2.80) of head sole and Mg, Se and P of all samples. Moreover, Mg, Ca and Fe bioaccessibility was lower in all sole extracts compared to rainbow trout.
