This study was aimed to determine the mineral contents and their hazardous level and associated health risk assessments in Sesame indicum Linn. seed samples grown in Ethiopia. To determine some selected metals (Na, Mg, Ca, K, Fe, Cu and Zn) in the samples, flame atomic absorption Spectrophotometer (FAAS) was used, and for the determination of phosphorus, Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer was used. The health risk assessment via consumption of S. indicum Linn seed has been conducted through evolution of estimated daily intake (EDI), Target hazard quotient (THQ) and hazard index (HI) values. The estimated daily intake (EDI) levels for male adults varied between 0.0511 
                        μ
                     g/kg/day to 0.829 
                        μ
                     g/kg/day, whereas for female adults were 0.0471 
                        μ
                     g/kg/day to 0.125 
                        μ
                     g/kg/day. The values of target hazard quotient (THQ), hazard index (HI) for male and female adult consumers in the studied sites were less than one (
                        <
                     1), indicates that there is no serious health risk for adults by the ingestion of S. indicum Linn seed.
