In the literature, mineral explorations by remote sensing are restricted to conventional image processing techniques, which are embedded to available commercial software; for instance, ERDAS, PCI Geomatica, and the Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI). Numerous remote-sensing geology works in a developed country is ill-defined. Since the beginning of remote-sensing mineralogy applications; there is no precise algorithm developing to state the quantity of detected mineralogists.
               This chapter aims at delivering new approaches for accurate automatic detection of mineral deposits in microwave remote-sensing data. The new approach is based on the unitization such Mahalanobis Classifier and Neural Network Algorithms as apart from the machine learning in image processing. Indeed, the machine learning is a keystone to construct automated systems, which can classify and recognize complex pattern spatial variations in such SAR data. It is not surprising that the demonstration of the SAR data as a coherent system cooperates as a vital role in determining what sorts of patterns can be automatically revealed.
               Finally, the results reveal that ANN distinguishes mineral deposits from encompassing completely different rock pattern options with a standard deviation of 0.12. Lastly, integration of various algorithms for mineral deposit detections provides higher ways in which of obtaining effective such mineral spatial detection. The ANN algorithmic rules is an acceptable algorithm for mineral deposits and gold potential zone detections, whereas the W2 mode is acceptable for the various rock and mineral deposit sort discriminations and detections exploitation RADARSAT-1 SAR data.
