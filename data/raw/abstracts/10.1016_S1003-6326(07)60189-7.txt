The decomposition reactions of monazite and bastnaesite mixed rare earth minerals calcined by CaO-NaCl-CaCl2 were studied by means of TG-DTA and XRD. The results show that the process of the minerals decomposed by CaO involves two steps. The first step occurs in the temperature range of 425–540 °C, and the main reactions are bastnaesite decomposition, i.e. REOF reacts with CaO to produce RE2O3 and CaF2, and Ce2O3 is oxidized to CeO2. During this step, CaCO3 is formed at about 500 °C. The second step takes place in the temperature range of 610–700 °C, and the reactions are monazite decomposition into RE2O3, Ca5F(PO4)3 and Ca3(PO4)2 by CaO and CaF2. In this process, the decomposition ability is improved because CaO from CaCO3 decomposing has high chemical activity. In calcining process, the new formed Ca5F(PO4)3 restrains fluorine that can escape in form of gaseous compound. The decomposition ratio of the mixed rare earth minerals reaches 90.8% at 700 °C.
