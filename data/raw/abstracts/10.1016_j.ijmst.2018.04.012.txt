The mature fine oil sand tailings (MFT) remain as slurry in the tailings pond for long time. The dewatering and consolidation of MFT for sustainable management is an important task for the mining industry. The objective of this study is to accelerate electrokinetic settling of MFT solids in suspensions in presence of optimal coagulant. In the first phase, optimal coagulant and coagulant dosage for settling of suspension are identified, i.e., ferric chloride at 350 mg/L. It is found that the chemical treatment is not much effective; the final solid content of the sediment is only 6.48% from an initial of 5%. In the second phase, combined coagulation and electrokinetic treatment is carried out to enhance the settling effect. The direct electric current is applied in continuous and intermittent modes on MFT suspensions placed in electrokinetic cell. The results show the final solid content reaches 23.74% under the combined application of 350 mg/L ferric chloride and 218.75 V/m applied voltage gradient in the continuous mode. The intermittent current mode with 40% save in power consumption produces a settled sediment having 20.84% final solid content.
