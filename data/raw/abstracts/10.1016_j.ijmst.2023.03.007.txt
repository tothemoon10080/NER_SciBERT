Grinding and flotation processes are often studied independently, despite the well-established grinding influence on flotation performance, which affects not only particle size and thus liberation but also shape and leads to complex changes in pulp chemistry affecting the particle surface properties relevant for selective bubble attachment. Yet, no study jointly investigated these possible causes and many are limited to single mineral flotation. We relate grinding conditions to changes in pulp chemistry and particle surface properties and assess their impact on upgrading. We studied three non-sulfide ores with different feed grades and valuables: scheelite, apatite, and fluorite. These were dry-, wet-, and wet conditioned-ground before flotation in a laboratory mechanical cell. Results were evaluated with bulk- and particle-specific methodologies. The selectivity of the process is higher after dry grinding for the fluorite and apatite ores and irrelevant for the scheelite ore. Variations in flotation kinetics of individual particles associated to their size and shape are not sufficient to explain these results. The higher concentration of Ca2+ and Mg2+ observed in the pulp after wet grinding, altering particle surface properties, better explains the phenomenon. Additionally, we demonstrate how particle shape impacts are system specific and related to both entrainment and true flotation.
