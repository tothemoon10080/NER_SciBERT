The method for determination of rare earth elements (REE: La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu) total concentrations in mineral waters was developed and validated. The proposed method comprised inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) detection and the 10-fold off-line REE preconcentration. To improve the method sensitivity and selectivity, the major matrix components and elements causing severe spectral interferences (Ba and Sr) were removed by the seaFAST-pico chromatographic system. The assessed method performance characteristics showed low detection limits (0.02 ng/L−0.3 ng/L), high elements recoveries (98% ± 4%), good repeatability (3%−5%), and satisfactory uncertainties (8%−16%). The method usability was confirmed via analysis of available reference materials with different water matrices (SLRS-5, SLRS-6, CASS-5, SERMIN1, and VIDAC18) and natural mineral waters originated either directly from wells or bottles sold in supermarkets.
