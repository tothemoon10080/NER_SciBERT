This work presents the use of an optimization algorithm with approximate computing capabilities in the simultaneous CO2 capture (CC) and utilization (CU) process design and controllability assessment. The CC design problem includes 6 solvent and process flowsheet combinations, followed by the use of a Rotating Packed Bed (RPB) process for the production of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) minerals as the CU option. The algorithm employs memoization and task dropping to accelerate execution in a high-performance cluster. The results indicate up to 141.7 h of saved CPU time due to the use of the approximate computing techniques. When the CC and CU processes are considered simultaneously, the generated Pareto front changes compared to the one of the CC process. The 2-Aminoethanol 30 wt. % solvent with intercooling and side feeds in the desorber results in almost equally profitable PCC production to the 3-Amino-1-Propanol 35 wt. % solvent in simpler flowsheets.
