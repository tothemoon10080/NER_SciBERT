Within the Department of Mines several research projects have recently been undertaken which have addressed metallurgical and environmental problems relevant to Western Australia's gold industry. For example, a comprehensive data base has been established on activated carbon which is used to recover gold from cyanide leach pulps. In response to industry requests laboratory tests were devised which assist users in evaluating new carbons for CIP applications and to monitor the performance of carbons in the plant.
                  Copper is an increasingly more common impurity in gold leach solutions and pulps. Two approaches to lower the level of copper in the final bullion have been pursued. The first is to control the chemistry of the electrowinning step while the second has demonstrated, in a full-scale plant trial, that it is possible to remove copper selectively from a cyanide leach solution using activated carbon.
                  A recently completed electrochemical study identified passivating films as the cause of the slow dissolution rate of gold telluride in conventional cyanidation. Suitable solution compositions were proposed for direct leaching of gold telluride using common reagents. This has implications for Western Australia which has a major telluride gold deposit at Kalgoorlie.
                  Contunuing environmental pressure on the mining industry has resulted in a study of the fate of cyanide in and around tailings dams. Analytical procedures have been developed for speciation of metal cyanide complexes. The cyanide attenuation properties of various soils around tailing dams were measured and long-term lysimeter tests for simulating tailings dam operation are continuing.
