The challenges of lithium analysis by the means of energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) are still present nowadays despite commercially available windowless detectors, which are not widespread. Since scanning electron microscopy (SEM), coupled with EDS, is the most common analytical tool in materials characterization, it is not surprising to observe an increase in the interest of Li analysis within this framework. However, there are still challenges to overcome, namely the choice of adequate analytical conditions as well as an understanding of the material behaviour under the electron gun. The present study illustrates a lepidolite-bearing granite and a spodumene crystal to show the limitations of conventional (i.e. with a window) EDS detector. It is broadened by the calculation of backscattered coefficients for the most common Li-bearing minerals, showing the weak contrasts they display in backscattered images. Monte Carlo simulation of electron-matter interactions within the different minerals show the size of the interaction zone. Finally, a presentation of simulated spectra can guide the user for a better identification of the phases of interest.
