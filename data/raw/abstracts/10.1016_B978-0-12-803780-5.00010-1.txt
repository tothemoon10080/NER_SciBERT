The processes that employ the rotary kiln as the primary reactor are many and they encompass all industries including food, dedicated dryers, and mineral processing. Herein we focus on minerals and materials processing and provide some of the key industrial processes that use a rotary kiln as the primary workhorse. We start with the cement and lime processes and then move on to describe some of the carbothermic reduction processes that employ the rotary kiln as the primary device where we examine two processes, iron ore reduction (the SL/RN (acronym for steel-making companies Stelco, Lurgi, and Republic National) process) and ilmenite ore reduction (the Becher process). We then examine the lightweight aggregate process and finally finish the chapter with a case study on biomass carbonization or pyrolysis/torrefaction at low temperatures.
