In this paper, the production process management system of minerals processing is established to realize the optimization of the production indices which are inventory of finished ore and capacity of equipment processing. The structure and function of the proposed system are discussed. A multiobjective optimization model is also proposed, and it aims to reduce finished ores inventory and utilize equipments capacity maximally on the basis of ensuring qualified tenor of finished ores. The way has been applied to production process of the largest hematite factory in China. The application results show that production efficiency is improved and remarkable benefits are obtained.
