Analyzing concentrations/grades for interested valuable elements in mineral ores with low detection limit, high accuracy, high precision and high assay speed is essential in the whole processing chain for economic benefits. In this work, a method using delayed gamma rays from neutron activation, based on an e-LINAC driven photoneutron source and a high-purity germanium detector, is introduced. It fulfills the requirements in analysis of gold ores including low detection limit (0.1 g/t), high precision and high assay speed (several minutes per sample for fulfilling the standard requirements). Comparing to the traditional method of fire assay, this method shows the advantages of low labor consumption, low time consuming, no toxic pollution, multi-element analysis ability and non-destruction.
