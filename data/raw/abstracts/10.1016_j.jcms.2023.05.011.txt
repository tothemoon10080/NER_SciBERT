The objective was to test the hypothesis of no difference in radiographic outcome after maxillary sinus floor augmentation (MSFA) with allogeneic adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) seeded on deproteinized bovine bone mineral (DBBM) (test) compared with excipient on DBBM (control). Eighteen minipigs were assigned into three groups of six animals and euthanised after one month (T1), two months (T2), and four months (T3), respectively. Each maxillary sinus was randomly allocated to either test or control with an equal volume of graft. Computed tomography scans (CTs) after MSFA (T0) were compared with CTs after euthanasia to evaluate graft volume (GV) changes and bone density (BD) using three-dimensional measurements and Hounsfield units. GV was larger in test compared with control at T1 (P = 0.046), whereas GV was larger in control compared with test at T3 (P = 0.01). BD increased from T0 to T1-T3 (P < 0.001) with both treatments. Higher BD was observed in control compared with test at T3 (P = 0.01), while no significant difference was observed at T1 and T2. Conclusively, the present study demonstrate that allogeneic ASCs seeded on DBBM in conjunction with MSFA seemed not to improve the radiographic outcome compared with excipient on DBBM. However, radiological outcomes need to be supplemented by bone histomorphometry before definitive conclusions can be provided about the beneficial use of allogeneic ASCs seeded on DBBM in conjunction with MSFA compared with DBBM alone.
