Prescribed fire (PB) is used to achieve ecological objectives and to reduce fuel hazard thus limiting detrimental impacts of wildfire and appropriate selection of prescription window is critical for these goals. Operational use of PB in the Mediterranean forest is scarce and information about its effects on soil remains incomplete. This study for the first time i) compared the immediate impact of spring and autumn PB and experimental summer fire on key properties of forest floor and mineral topsoil in Mediterranean black pine forest, and ii) assessed the capacity of PB to reduce fuel, with limited immediate impacts on soil. PB significantly reduced the 32.5 % of pre-fire forest floor depth, while summer fire consumed 88.5 % and exposed about 30 % of the mineral soil surface. Mean maximum temperature during fire at the mineral soil surface was 23 °C in PB, in contrast to 128 °C in summer fire, while soil heating at 2 cm depth was negligible in both cases. PB did not cause immediate changes in OM quality parameters, and chemical (C and N concentrations, C/N and pH) and microbiological properties (Cmic, Cmic/C, and β-glucosidase, acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase activities) in forest floor or mineral topsoil (0–2 cm). By contrast, summer fire greatly increased OM recalcitrance and reduced Cmic, Cmic/C and enzyme activities in forest floor immediately after fire. In the mineral topsoil, only microbial properties were significantly reduced. The maximum temperature reached during fire in forest floor and topsoil was associated with most of the overall changes in properties in both layers. The findings suggest that prescribed fire can significantly reduce fuel with limited initial impacts on soil. Although these findings are encouraging for operational use of prescribed burning in the ecosystem under study, long-term monitoring of repeated application of the technique on soil properties and other ecosystem components is necessary.
