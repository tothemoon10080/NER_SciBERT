The objective of this paper is to evaluate the coal petrology characteristics of slack middlings (13–0.5mm) of dense media separation and flotation middlings from Qianjiaying fat coal preparation plant. Phase composition, macerals distribution, microlithotype and mineral occurrence of the two middlings were studied by XRD analysis and polarized light microscopy observation. Macerals distribution and wettability of the float-and-sink products separated from the middlings after grinding was investigated to determine the liberation degree. Studies show that there are more vitrinite and mineral, but less inertinite in slack middlings than in flotation middlings. Macerals associated with mineral in slack middlings is 69.85%, by volume, which is 17.86% higher than that in flotation middlings. Minerals in slack middlings are dominated by pyrite and clay, which are disseminated with the diameter less than 2μm. The main mineral in flotation middlings is clay with size range of 2–20μm. Single macerals in the slack middlings are difficult to liberate due to the fine-grained minerals. After grinding, macerals associated with minerals in the slack middlings decrease to 46.73%, by volume, which is higher than in flotation middlings by 25.89%, by volume. For slack middlings with poor liberation degree, density fractions below 1.8g/cm3 is hydrophobic with contact angle above 71.5°. For the well liberated flotation middlings, there is significant wettability difference among the float-and-sink products. This research is the theoretical basis to realize re-separation of middlings.
