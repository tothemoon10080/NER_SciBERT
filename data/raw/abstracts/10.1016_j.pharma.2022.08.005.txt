Two species of plants commonly used for mainly their therapeutic values and available in some herbalists shops, namely: Brocchia cinerea and Matricaria pubescens that both belong to asteraceae family, and encountered mainly in the Algerian desert, have drawn attention in the scope of assessing their mineral contents, in fact minerals play an important role in the plant homeostasis and metabolism, on the other hand they may influence the health conditions mainly due to toxicity, and also the benefits that the plant consumer could have, the current study aimed to assess the contents of Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb, Zn, As, Na, K, Mg, P, S and SI, beside comparing the obtained results to other similar studies, the aerial parts of the plants are collected from several sites then mineralized and analyzed using ICP-AES and AAS, high levels of Na, K and Mg have been noted, on the other hands levels of metals were noted to be overall marginal, except for Al and Hg for the sample of Brocchia cinerea from El oued, the levels of As also seemed to be high in all the samples, inversely to the levels of S and P which seemed lower than those noted for other plants in paralleled studies, while that similar results were found for Zn, Fe, the chemical and geologic features of the soils may be the influencing factor. Additionally the current study may put first milestone for the establishment of national guidelines regarding the mineral contents of medicinal plants.
