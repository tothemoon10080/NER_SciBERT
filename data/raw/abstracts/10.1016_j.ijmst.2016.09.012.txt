The effects of mechanical activation in a planetary mill on the structural changes and microstructural characteristics of the components of ferruginous quartzite beneficiation tailings generated by wet magnetic separation process were studied using X-ray and laser diffraction methods. The results revealed the relationship between variations in the mean particle size of activated powders and the milling time. The crystallite size, microstrain, lattice parameters and unit cell volumes were determined for different milling times in powder samples of quartz, hematite, dolomite, and magnetite from the beneficiation tailings. The main trends in the variation of the crystallite size of quartz, hematite, dolomite, and magnetite as a function mean particle size of powder samples were revealed. Changes in the particle shape as a function of the activation time was also investigated.
