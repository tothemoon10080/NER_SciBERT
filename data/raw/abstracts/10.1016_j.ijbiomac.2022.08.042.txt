The research endeavour to synthesize a novel, non-toxic, eco-friendly guar gum based biopolymeric macromolecule, [2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl] trimethyl ammonium chloride grafted guar gum (GG-g-P (MAETMAC)) that has been optimized as a flocculant for mineral ore processing. The synthesis was performed using non-radiation and microwave assisted technique to compare and ensure the superiority of the latter. The intended grafting of monomer[2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl] trimethyl ammonium chloride on to the biological macromolecule (guar gum) was confirmed through standard physico-chemical characterization techniques namely X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible (UV–visible) spectroscopy, intrinsic viscosity study, etc. The flocculation efficacy of the synthesized novel graft copolymer was thoroughly investigated in kaolin, coal fine, and iron ore suspensions. We have explored a graft copolymer, [2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl] trimethyl ammonium chloride grafted guar gum that has not been studied yet to the best of our knowledge. To establish the superiority of the synthesized biomaterial, the flocculation study revealed that the best grade of the synthesized novel graft copolymer showed flocculation efficacy of 90 % in kaolin, 69 % in Iron ore, and 29 % in coal fine suspensions which was significantly higher than using alum as a coagulant which provided 36 % efficacy in kaolin, 29 % in iron ore and 10 % in coal fine suspensions.
