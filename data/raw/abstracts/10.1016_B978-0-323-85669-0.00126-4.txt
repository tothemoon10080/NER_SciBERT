The determination of the hydrophobicity of minerals is a central activity in research into the physical chemistry of mineral flotation. The tendency for surfaces to interact well or adversely with water determines whether a mineral will be collected in a flotation cell. This review focuses on a description of the core chemistry and physics behind the property of surface hydrophobicity, and on the measurement of that degree of hydrophobicity for real mineral surfaces, on microscopic and macroscopic length scales, using the most advanced imaging tools for visualizing the three-phase contact line between solid, liquid, and vapor. Furthermore, attention is paid to the non-traditional means to infer hydrophobicity based on surface chemical species detected on mineral surfaces. In addition to the descriptions of methodologies and examples of contact angle determination for real minerals, the study of heterogeneity (both chemical and physical) is woven through the review, emphasizing the need to consider, roughness and patchiness of surfaces. The impact of these aspects of surface hydrophobicity, altered by the interaction of the mineral surface with commonly encountered surface-active species (including polymers), is described with reference to specific examples from the literature on bubble-surface interactions.
