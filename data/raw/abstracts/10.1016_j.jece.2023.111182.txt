The rapid increase in the global population and demand for commodities has contributed to the rapid depletion of metal and coal resources. A critical issue for the mineral processing industry is how to achieve low-grade metal ore purification and coal desulfurization under the "carbon peaking" and "carbon neutral" strategies. Although flotation technology is rapidly developing and being promoted, its limited efficiency and environmental pollution have pushed the use of bioflotation. The eco-friendly and adaptable bioflotation is favorable for manufacturing high-quality concentrates, is geared toward fine particles and holds considerable development potential. The principles of action, process intensification and future directions of bioflotation require urgent investigation, given the significant challenges that it currently confronts. This review systematically discusses the current research status of bioflotation from four aspects: the basis of bioflotation, the mechanism of bioflotation, the application extension of bioflotation, and the prospect of industrial application for bioflotation. The current challenges of bioflotation in terms of economic, environmental, and technical aspects are summarized. Finally, new directions and technological systems for future bioflotation are proposed, including: microbial regulation, mechanism investigation, bioflotation reagents, integration of mineral processing methods, carbon dioxide fixation, response of independent variables, industrialization of bioflotation, as well as social and economic benefits. The resolution of the abovementioned fundamental scientific and technological problems will provide efforts to reduce environmental pollution, drive the high-quality growth of the minerals/coal processing industry, and achieve the strategy of a "low carbon" economy.
