Historically, reconciliation has been viewed as a quality test of model estimates as well as a powerful tool for detecting and correcting problems in all stages of mine operations from resource estimation to metal production. If used correctly, reconciliation helps to better predict the life of mine (LOM), improves the adherence of production plans to the respective budget, and allows for effective control of the mining and milling processes. However, the accuracy of reconciliation results requires that all input data must be generated in accordance with the principles of sampling correctness. Furthermore, complete reconciliation systems can become extremely complex and must be carefully analyzed in order to provide realistic and helpful conclusions. Based on these concepts, this paper presents a successful proactive reconciliation system applied to a copper and gold mine in Brazil for monitoring and integrating mining and milling operations.
