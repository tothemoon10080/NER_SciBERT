In order to understand how microorganisms influence mineral surface processes, a better assessment of how microorganisms colonise mineral surfaces in situ is necessary. A crucial question in understanding mineralâ€“microbial processes is whether colonization by microbial cells on mineral surfaces is a random process or whether it follows a selective pattern related primarily to the chemical composition of the mineral.
