There has been a significant progress in the use of mathematical modeling and simulation in the minerals industry in the last decade. Process models have moved from academic world to important industrial tools. This paper reviews the status of mineral processing simulators and recent progress in simulator development and applications is discussed. The simulation for process design and optimisation is now an established technique, as evidenced by its increasing use of practising engineers through commercially available simulator software. The paper presents a systematic approach to the process study procedure for the control system development, clarified by practical case examples calculated by SimCon - a novel steady-state simulator for mineral processes. Examples of the application of SimCon in drawing flowsheets, calculating mass balances and making simulations for grinding and flotation processes are presented. At the end of the paper, the state-of-the-art and the future of computer-aided process study at mineral processing plants is discussed.
