This paper seeks to identify- and where possible, to quantify- the factors responsible for the deterioration in overall plant performance (grade and recovery) experienced under the reduced process temperatures prevailing in winter. The effect of seasonal variations in temperature on unit operations-milling, classification, thickening, filtration and flotation- is discussed. Specific cases are presented as examples, and recommendations are formulated.
