The Zarshuran Carlin-type gold deposit is located in the NW part of the Sanandaj-Sirjan metamorphic zone which hosts Neoproterozoic carbonate and black shale rock units. Concentration-Volume (C–V) fractal model and Turning Band Simulation method have been applied to effectively separate gold mineralized stages in the Zarshuran deposit. Three mineralized stages determined by the means of C–V fractal model and Turning Bands Simulation method were correlated with the mineralized stages considering geological studies. The results revealed the presence of enriched (>37 ppm) and Au high grade (5.5–37 ppm) mineralized zones within the deposit. A log ratio matrix was used to correlate the results obtained by the C–V fractal model and turning band simulation for Au and lithological units which showed that the main mineralized zones occur in the black gouges and Jasperoids.
