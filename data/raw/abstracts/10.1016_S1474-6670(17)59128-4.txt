This paper presents a software product written in the FORTH language which is intended for dynamic modelling of mineral processing operations with or without control loops. To take the advantage of the FORTH language which is powerful for defining generic functions among other features the authors have developed a package of tools to generate basic models and control schemes available for single-as well as multi-component mass flows specific to mineral processing operations. The software package developed so far involves generators for complete mixers with or without backflow, pipes to simulate plug flow as well as reactions such that grinding, flotation and other process kinetics can be embraced. The system will also embody process indentification and adaptive control schemes which will enable quasi-automatic design and installation of control circuits.
