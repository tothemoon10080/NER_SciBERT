Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) has been listed in Annex A of the Stockholm Convention as a persistent and bio-accumulative chemical. While HBCD is often present in the solid form for its low solubility, cost-effective technologies have been lacking for the degradation of solid-phase HBCD. In this work, mechanochemical (MC) destruction of high-energy ball milling was employed for direct destruction of solid-phase HBCD, where a strong reducer, microscale zero-valent aluminum (mZVAl), was used as the co-milling agent. The new mZVAl-assisted MC process achieved complete debromination and mineralization of HBCD within 3 h milling. The optimal operating parameters were determined, including the milling atmosphere, the milling speed, the mZVAl-to-HBCD molar ratio, and the ball-to-mZVAl mass ratio. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and Raman analyses revealed that the organic structures of HBCD were destroyed and organic bromine was completely converted into inorganic bromide, accompanied by the generation of amorphous and graphite carbon. Analysis of the milled samples by GCâ€“MS demonstrated the absence of obvious organic matter after MC treatment, also indicating the complete degradation and conversion of HBCD to inorganic compounds. Further X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis indicates that the fresh surface of mZVAl was generated upon the MC treatment, and Al(0) served as a strong reducing agent (e-donor) for reductive debromination and destruction of the carbon skeleton. The mZVAl-assisted MC milling appears promising as a non-combustion approach for effective destruction and carbonization/mineralization of solid-phase HBCD or potentially other persistent organic pollutants.
