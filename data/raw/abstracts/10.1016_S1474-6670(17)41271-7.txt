In this article told about twophase mathematical modell of granulation’s process in the fluidized bed. A problem of the investigation of a mathematical model of a drying and granulation process in fluidized bed with the help of a recycleness process, when a disperse content’s change is executed for account of large granule breaking, is considered in present article. It was spent rewision of the adequacy of modell in the research plant.
