Chitosan/zinc sulfide (CS/ZnS) nano-composite films have been prepared by simulating bio-mineralization process. Factors affecting the hydrothermal stability and fluorescence properties of the films have been studied. Furthermore, the sensing properties of nano-composite films to lead ions have been systematically investigated. SEM and TEM observations showed that the size of ZnS particles is 70nm, and the particles are evenly distributed within the CS films. The fluorescence emission of the nano-composite films indicates that the sizes of real fluorescing ZnS particles are less than 20nm. This suggests that ZnS particles observed via SEM and TEM may be aggregates of smaller ZnS particles, and the smaller particles may be separated by the organics. The fluorescence emission (363nm) of the nano-composite films is very sensitive to the presence of Pb ions. C(Pb
