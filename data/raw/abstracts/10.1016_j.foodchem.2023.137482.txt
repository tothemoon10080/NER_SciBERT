A novel biomimetic mineralized covalent organic framework (BM-COF) was prepared based on magnetic silk fibroin and a new sulforaphane pretreatment technology was constructed. First, metal coordination was performed on the surface of silk fibroin, and nanoparticles were deposited by in-situ mineralization after co-precipitation. Then, biomineralized COFs were prepared by in-situ self-assembly of a COF layer on Fe3O4@silk fibroin surface guided by interfacial directional growth technology. The BM-COFs had a multilayer structure, large specific surface area and pore volume, and superparamagnetic properties, which make them an ideal adsorbent. The adsorption of sulforaphane by BM-COFs is mainly multi-molecular layer adsorption and chemisorption, there might be electrostatic action, π-stacking and hydrogen bonding in the adsorption process. The composite material was successfully used for the pretreatment of sulforaphane in cruciferous vegetables. An extraction time of 30 min gave extraction efficiencies as high as 92%, and the recovery could reach more than 73%.
