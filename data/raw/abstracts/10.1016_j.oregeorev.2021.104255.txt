We report the iron (n = 13), copper (n = 13), sulfur (n = 25) and lead (n = 31) isotope compositions of mineralized samples from porphyry, skarn and epithermal mineralization in the Yenice region that lies in the east of the Biga Peninsula, Turkey. The vast majority of isotopic data were analyzed from the world-class Arapuçandere Pb-Zn-Cu (Ag-Au) deposit that is one of the best example of intermediate sulfidation epithermal deposits within the Serbo-Macedonian-Rhodope metallogenic belt in the northeastern of the Aegean. The δ56Fe values range from −1.06 to + 0.46‰ and reflect the complex interplay between redox, Rayleigh and kinetic effects. The δ65Cu values also define a narrow ranges of −0.07 to +0.77‰ that is typical of primary minerals in magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits worldwide. The Cu isotope values of chalcopyrite from the Arapuçandere deposit tend to progressively increase through the surface, which creates a vector from the proximal to distal portions of magmatic-hydrothermal environment, possibly with local supergene processes within deposit. The sulfides from the Yenice region have a relatively narrow range of δ34S values that range between −4.0 and 3.9‰ and mostly cluster around 0‰, indicating sulfur is mainly derived from a magmatic source at the time of mineralization. All the Pb isotope data that includes results from ore minerals fall within the fields defined by Oligocene to Miocene Aegean-West Anatolian magmatic rocks. This observation supports the hypothesis that the metals and sulfur contained within all the various styles of mineralization considered here were derived entirely from these granitoids, with no significant contamination from the local basement rocks. This observation also constrains the processes controlling the Fe and Cu isotope compositions to those operating within the porphyry, skarn, and epithermal hydrothermal systems, rather than contamination by interaction with the basement rocks.
