Mineral pigments have an important position in the traditional arts. To better protect cultural relics, the effects of high energy ball milling on the structure and properties of mineral pigments was investigated using malachite and turquoise as examples. Samples were characterized using a range of physical and spectroscopic measurements to determine the composition, morphology, and particle size of the samples. Chromaticity analysis was carried out using the L*a*b* color space model. The results showed that milling reduced the size and distribution of the mineral particles, reaching an amorphous state of high specific surface area. The crystalline state of the samples changed with milling time. Valency, atomic abundance, luminance, reflectivity, and chromaticity of the milled samples all showed various changes affected by crystallinity and grain size. Color change in malachite manifested mainly as a red-shift yellowish green with increasing milling time. Polycrystalline turquoise was bluish green and showed no color change during milling. The results from this study may provide the basis for improvements in antique pigment technology and assist with the selection of suitable pigments for the restoration of paintings.
