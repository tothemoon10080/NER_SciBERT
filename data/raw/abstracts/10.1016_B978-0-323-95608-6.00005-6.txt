Geophysical techniques, be they seismic, magnetic, gravity, or the like, have been extensively applied to discover mineral resources. A combination of two or more geophysical data interpretations can push the further limit of human knowledge in understanding underground geology structures rather than using only a single geophysical data result. Integration of geophysical data can use two or more different geophysical properties to image the deep geology by easily overlaying the two results in the same coordinates frame. In our research, we discuss the use of gravity, magnetic, seismic, magnetotelluric, radiometric, and induced polarization datasets in mineral exploration. Five case studies are used to show the role of geophysics in mineral exploration. The results showed that the geophysical surveys represent some techniques that can be used as effective tools to detect subsurface objects, promising areas for mineralization, mineralization related to hydrothermal and structural systems, and preferred sites for drilling.
