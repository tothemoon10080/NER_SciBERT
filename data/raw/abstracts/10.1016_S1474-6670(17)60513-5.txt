This paper describes a Process Simulation Package for modelling the steady-state operation of a mineral processing plant. There are two levels of input allowed into the package. The first allows simple manipulation of the process models within a defined modular format which enables a wide range of process systems to be simulated. The second lovel of input is via a Command file which allows plant models to be defined and changed without reference to the code or the requirement of any recompiling of the programme sources. The Command file interface was designed for use by metallurgists and assumes a sound knowledge of the system being modelled. As such it is an effective tool for metallurgists rather than a user friendly generalised package for the layman.
