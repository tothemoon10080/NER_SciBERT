Mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) is the largest soil organic carbon (OC) pool with the longest turnover. MAOM is expected to have relatively little sensitivity to climate change due to mineral protection, but its persistence involves several organo-mineral fractions. The uncertainty in the response of specific organo-mineral fractions to climate change hampers the reliability of predictions of MAOM preservation in the future. Here, we applied a sequential chemical fractionation method integrated with network analysis to investigate MAOM stabilization mechanisms across five alpine ecosystems: alpine desert, alpine steppe, alpine meadow, alpine wetland, and alpine forest. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed grouping of seven extractable OM fractions in MAOM into three OM clusters: a cluster with weak bondings consisting of water-soluble OM (WSOM) and weakly adsorbed fractions (2.1–21.3% of total OC); a cluster with metal-bound complexes comprising Ca-OM complexes and Fe/Al-OM complexes (3.8–12.2% of total OC); and a cluster with strong bonding composed of Al oxyhydroxides, carbonates and Fe oxyhydroxides (12.2–33.5% of total OC). The relative percentages of OM from soils of the five ecosystems in the three clusters exhibited distinct pH dependence patterns. With the increase in pH, the cluster with weak bondings decreased, and that with strong bondings increased, while the one with metal-bound complexes showed a maximum at weakly acidic pH. Organo-mineral fractions and metal cations in MAOM constructed a complex network with pH as the central node. Results suggest that precipitation does not only alter vegetation type and microbial biomass but also regulate soil pH, which is balanced by specific metal cations, thus resulting in particular pH preference of specific OM clusters. These findings demonstrate that soil pH plays a central role in unveiling MAOM dynamics and can serve as a good predictor of soil organo-mineral fractions across alpine ecosystems.
