Imaging spectroscopy is used for the mapping of different minerals using their characteristics absorption depths. The present study covers the parts of the Udaipur region for mineral mapping with the help of a Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF) soft classifier using the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer â€“ Next Generation dataset. The preprocessed and classified dataset by MTMF soft classifier identified carbonates, serpentine minerals, and alteration products of ultramafics, clay and mica minerals, and intimate mixture of kaolinite and muscovite in the region. These minerals show the characteristic absorption features at different wavelength positions of the SWIR region. The comparison of the image spectrum was carried out with the reference (mineral library) and laboratory collected reflectance spectral curves. The derived mineral map accurately mapped the minerals and discriminated the minerals belonging to a similar mineral class. Validation was done using field evidences, photomicrographs, XRD, laboratory spectral curves, and already published maps. The accuracy for the generated mineral map is 83.93%.
