To study the seepage and deformation characteristics of coal at high temperatures, coal samples from six different regions were selected and subjected to computed tomography (CT) scanning studies. In conjunction with ANSYS software, 3D reconstruction of CT images was used for the establishment of fluid-solid conjugate heat transfer model and coal thermal deformation model based on the microstructures of coal. In addition, the structure of coal was studied in 2D and 3D perspectives, followed by the analysis of seepage and deformation characteristics of coal at high temperatures. The results of this study indicated that porosity positively correlated with the fractal dimension, and the connectivity and seepage performances were roughly identical from 2D and 3D perspectives. As the porosity increased, the fractal dimension of coal samples became larger and the pore-fracture structures became more complex. As a result, the permeability of coal samples decreased. In the meantime, fluid was fully heated, generating high-temperature water at outlet. However, when the porosity was low, the outlet temperature was very high. The average deformation of coal skeleton with different pore-fracture structures at high temperatures showed a trend of initial increase and subsequent decrease with the increase of porosity and fractal dimension. The maximum deformation of coal skeleton positively correlated with connectivity but negatively correlated with the fractal dimension.
