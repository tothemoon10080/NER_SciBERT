A series of numerical simulations of turbulent single-phase flows are performed to understand the flow and mixing characteristics in a laboratory scale flotation tank. Four impeller blade shapes covering a wide range of surface areas and lip lengths are considered to highlight and contrast the flow behavior predicted in the impeller stream. The mean flow close to the impeller is fully characterized by considering velocity components along the axial direction at different radial locations. Normalized results suggest the development of a comparatively stronger axial velocity component for a blade design with the smallest lip length, called big-tip impeller here. Normalized turbulent kinetic energy profiles close to the impeller reveal the existence of an asymmetric trailing vortex pair. The highest turbulence kinetic energy dissipation rates are observed close to the impeller blades and stator walls where the radial jet strikes the stator walls periodically. Furthermore, liquid phase mixing in the flotation cell is studied using transient scalar tracing simulations providing mixing time data. Finally, pumping capacity and efficiency of different impeller designs are calculated based on which the impeller blade design with a rectangular blade design is found to perform most efficiently.
