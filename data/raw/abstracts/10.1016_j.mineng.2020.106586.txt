(Bio)Hydrometallurgy is a relatively economical and eco-friendly processing technology for sulfide minerals. Sulfide minerals degradation at abandoned mine sites also results in complex environmental problems. Although extensive studies have been done to explore the dissolution mechanisms of various sulfide minerals in acidic (microbial) sulfate environments, a systematic comparison of the findings is still needed. This paper summarizes the research into the dissolution mechanisms of several sulfide minerals, predominantly under bioleaching conditions. Especially, electrochemical cyclic voltammetry studies of various minerals are shown. Additionally, effects on the solid phase, including decomposition products and precipitates formed during the degradation processes, are discussed.
