This paper reviews the tools and methodologies used for incorporating sustainability considerations into the design of mineral processing operations. It was found that while there is a range of tools and methodologies that contribute to Design for Sustainability, there is no consistent, integrated approach to support the mineral industry in incorporating a greater level of sustainability into the design process. This paper identifies the required elements in such an approach and discusses the ways in which its development would progress the industry towards sustainability.
