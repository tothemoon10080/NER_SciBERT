Limited freshwater availability, increasing competition for water among multiple users, cost of purification, corporate sustainability goals, etc., are the main factors driving many industries to focus on water quality and usage. Increasing water reuse and accessing alternative sources of freshwater are potential strategies to improve water efficiency. This paper aims to identify water treatment options that produce suitable water for flotation and other mineral processing operations. It investigates the performance of nanofiltration membranes in producing suitable water quality for the separation of minerals based on the ionic strength tolerance threshold at which impurities begin to impact the separation process. In this study, the membranes used could reject >95 % of divalent cations (such as Ca2+ and Mg2+) and >74 % of monovalent ions (e.g., Na+ and Cl−) under the conditions of 12 bar of transmembrane pressure and 65 % of the recovery. These rejection rates were found to be sufficient to produce fit-for-purpose water for mineral processing. In addition, the effect of pressure on the mass transfer mechanism of each membrane was determined.
