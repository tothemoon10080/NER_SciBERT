This study intends to explore the lubrication mechanism of eco-friendly lubricant formulated from non-edible vegetable oils and mineral oil. The efficacy of the lubricant as friction and wear-reduction additive is determined to have a mixed lubrication regime with the optimum concentration of 80 % S100, 10 % C100, and 10 % J100 (S80C10J10). A protective film and mending effect have been suggested as lubricating mechanisms. The lubrication regime is changed from mixed to hydrodynamic by increasing the volume percent of C100 and J100, which improves the COF because fluid drags cause friction to be produced by the fluid on the moving surface. The inability of the additive to form a protective layer led to the worst COF and WSD.
