In the present study the methodology for assessing the effect of dental treatments on the mineral density of pathological tooth tissues using micro-CT was proposed. The mineral density values of early carious enamel and dentine in its vicinity with the apparent mineral density of the same tissues modified by two filling materials and an infiltrant were compared. Five cases were considered ex vivo. The high efficacy of laboratory micro-CT for carrying out such observations has been demonstrated. The composite resin was found to be very close in terms of the apparent mineral density to natural enamel as opposed to glass ionomer cement. Also, unlike the latter, the composite resin showed a small amount of internal structural artifacts. When studying the effect of the infiltrant on the apparent mineral density of carious enamel and dentine bordering it, a significant negative effect of acid pre-treatment was observed. In none of the infiltration cases considered was the apparent mineral density of the modified enamel restored to its natural values. In one case the infiltrant reached the dentine and increased its apparent mineral density.
