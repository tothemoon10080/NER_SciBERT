The pretreatment of gold ores before cyanidation is a challenging problem due to the worldâ€™s annual huge waste of refractory gold minerals. Generally, the leaching of gold by cyanidation without any pre-oxidation causes an extraction lower than 90%. In recent decades, a variety of treatment and pretreatment methods have been used to increase the recovery of refractory gold ores. The advantages and disadvantages of different techniques were reviewed in this paper compared with the ozonation. Ozone is used for mineral pretreatment in the form of ozone ice, ozone-saturated water and ozone bubbles. In the first step of this work, the application and necessity of gold pretreatment by ozone before cyanidation were analyzed. In the next part, the mechanisms and kinetics of gold ozonation were studied to elaborate on the details of this pre-oxidation process. The ozonation of refractory minerals can improve gold extraction through direct treatment or indirect oxidation. It minimizes gold entrapping with refractory minerals by creating desired oxidizing conditions for sulphides destruction. Therefore, it is a suitable substitution for conventional pretreatment techniques. The dissolution of sulphides increases with an enhancement in ozone concentration in the carrying gas by increasing the driving force of ozone transfer to the aqueous phase for the reaction. The high efficiency, environmental-friendly, short-term process, easy ozone production, strong oxidizing conditions and low capital costs are the considerable properties of ozonation pretreatment. The kinetics of ozonation of pyrite and arsenopyrite was reported to follow the chemical control in previous works.
