Brassica rapa L. (2n = 20; AA) is a vegetable and oilseed crop that is grown all over the world. Its leaves, shoots, and seeds store significant amounts of minerals. We used inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) to determine the concentrations of eleven minerals in the leaves and seeds of 195 advanced generation inbred lines, of which 92 represented natural (NR) B. rapa and the remaining 103 were derived (DR) from a set of mother genotypes originally extracted from an allotetraploid B. juncea (2n = 36; AABB). The inbred lines differed for the composition of leaf and seed minerals. Leaf concentrations of N, K, Zn, and Se were higher in the DR subpanel as compared to NR subpanel, along with high seed accumulations of K and Se. DArT genotyping and genome wide association mapping led to the identification of SNPs associated with leaf and seed mineral compositions. Chromosomes A03, A05, and A10 harboured the most associated loci. Annotations of the regions adjacent to respective GWAS peaks allowed prediction of genes known for acquisition, transport, and accumulation of minerals and heavy metal detoxification. Transcriptome analysis revealed differential expression patterns of the predicted candidates, with most genes either down-regulated in derived genotypes relative to natural forms or their expression being comparable between the two. General downregulation may be a consequence of extracting B. rapa from allotetraploid B. juncea through genome resection. Some of the identified SNPs may be used as DNA markers for breeding programmes designed to modify the leaf and seed mineral compositions.
