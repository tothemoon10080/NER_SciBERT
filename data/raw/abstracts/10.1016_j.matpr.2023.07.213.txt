Fly ash serves as the primary binder in geopolymer concrete (GPC), Several experiments have been performed using ground blast furnace slag (GGBS) as a fly ash additive in GPC and the results show that GGBS enrichment improves the mechanical properties. Existing experimental investigation employs a constant (optimum) percentage of condensed silica fume (CSF) along with GGBS as part replacement of fly ash in GPC of M40 grade. Glass fiber reinforcement was incorporated at percentages of 0.5,0.75 and 1.0 in the GPC composite. Laboratory specimens were prepared, and the mechanical properties were found at various curing periods ranging from 7 days to 60 days under ambient conditions. It is inferred that extended curing periods at ambient conditions have increased the mechanical strengths of GPC mixes. Glass fiber has contributed to strength increase, particularly in tension and flexure. Condensed silica fume has contributed towards more strength and workability of GPC.
