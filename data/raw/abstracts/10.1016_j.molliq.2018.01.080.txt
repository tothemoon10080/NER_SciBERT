To remove the bisphenol A (BPA) effectively from groundwater great attempts made in the current work to optimize the operating parameters of electrochemical peroxidation (ECP) process using response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design (CCD). The obtained data from ANOVA analysis revealed the significance of experimental variables. The obtained removal efficiency of BPA demonstrated that the predicted quadratic model is highly adequate and applicable. According to the experimental data, it found that the best removal efficiency of 100% achieved at initial concentrations BPA of 5.0 mg·L−1, hydrogen peroxide amount of 55.0 μL, pH 3.0, reaction time 12.0 min, and current density 6.0 mA·cm−2. The rate of the oxidation process of BPA reduced by increasing the amount of H2O2 and Fe2+ ions, which might be due to the reducing the amount of hydroxyl free radicals involved in the scavenging reaction. The kinetics of the process follows the pseudo first-order model with rate constants of 0.596 min−1 (R2 = 0.9908). Since, most of the reported studies are based on one factor at the time method, in the current study, RSM was used to evaluate the main effects of parameters, their simultaneous interactions and quadratic effect to achieve the optimum condition for EC process. The kinetics studies of ECP process provide valuable information on the mechanism of the degradation process that attributes to the presence of free hydroxyl radicals.
