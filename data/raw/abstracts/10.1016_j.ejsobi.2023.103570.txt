Stand development affects soil properties, nitrogen (N) dynamics, and soil microbial community composition, but the question remains whether differences in N mineralization rates are mirrored by the abundance of relevant functional genes. In this study, we used the 15N pool-dilution method to estimate N mineralization (i.e., ammonification and nitrification) rates across a Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) chronosequence, with stands aged 7, 16, 29, 36, and >80 years. Gene copy numbers of bacteria (16S rRNA), fungi (ITS), ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) (amoA), denitrifiers (nirS, nirK), N2 fixers (nifH) and organic N decomposers (chiA) were quantified by qPCR. Gross ammonification and nitrification rates increased linearly with stand age in the topsoil (0–5 cm depth) and were strongly positively correlated with the abundance of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and AOA amoA, respectively. Higher net nitrification but lower NO3
                     − immobilization rates in older stands (32 and > 80 years) drove higher N availability for vegetation than in young stands (7 years). Older stands also had higher rates of NH4
                     + consumption than younger stands due to the increased fungal ITS abundance and higher microbial biomass N (MBN), and AOA amoA was more abundant and active than AOB amoA due to the more acid conditions characteristic of mature forests. Redundancy analysis showed that functional gene abundance was strongly affected by soil properties such as pH, NH4
                     +-N content, and MBN. We also found that microbial N storage potential was lower, and the NO3
                     −-N leaching and gaseous N loss potential were higher in older stands than in younger stands. Collectively, stand developmental stage gave rise to the observed spatial gradient of gross ammonification and nitrification rates by altering the abundance of microbial functional genes, which affected plantation productivity via its modulation of the supply of bioavailable N.
