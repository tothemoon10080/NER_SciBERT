Electrochemical techniques are very useful tools for characterizing the surface properties of natural minerals involved in electrochemical reactions. This work reviews the recent advances in electrochemical characterizations of minerals by employing various electrochemical techniques, i.e., open circuit potential, chronoamperometry, potential sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and electrochemical scanning probe techniques. The fundamental working principles of these electrochemical techniques and their applications for mineral surface characterizations in various research areas, including mineral flotation, mineral leaching, electrocatalysis, energy storage materials and environmental issues, are highlighted. Valuable information such as the redox condition of substrate surface, the current response of substrate with time under polarization, the identification of redox reaction and its kinetics on substrate surface, the structure of substrate/electrolyte interface, and the local electrochemical response on substrate surface at microâˆ’/nano-scale can be obtained by open circuit potential, chronoamperometry, potential sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and scanning electrochemical microscopy, respectively. Some remaining challenges and future perspectives are discussed. These recent advances in electrochemical techniques can be readily applied to characterize the surface properties and interfacial interactions of a wide variety of material systems and in different engineering processes.
