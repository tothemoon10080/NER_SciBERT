The excessive use of herbicides had caused serious environmental pollution and ecological problems. Therefore, it is imperative to explore an effective method to reduce herbicide residues and pollution. In the present study, we used superabsorbent hydrogels coated 14C-acetochlor (SH-ACE) to investigate its behavior in different soils under oxic conditions. After 100 days, the mineralization by SH-ACE was increased by 2.3%, 2.5% and 3.3% in the red clay soils, fluvio-marine yellow loamy soils and coastal saline soils, respectively, compared to the control group. This result indicated that the SH-ACE treatment resulted in more complete degradation and detoxification of acetochlor. In addition, the dissipation rates of acetochlor were significantly faster in the SH-ACE treatment, which reduced the persistence of acetochlor. The probable degradation pathways of acetochlor involved dechlorination, hydroxylation, deethoxymethylation, and the formation of thioacetic acid derivatives in the two treatments, but the contents of transformation products were completely different. These findings suggest that the SH-ACE treatment has a significant effect to accelerate the degradation of acetochlor. When developing green pesticides, we emphasize that superabsorbent hydrogel coating treatment should be considered as a promising method for ecological safety in the environment.
