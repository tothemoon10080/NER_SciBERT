Spent ion exchange resins have become a crucial radioactive solid waste from the nuclear industry. Developing effective and safe disposal methods as alternatives to the present cementation method remains challenging. This investigation demonstrates the treatment of a mixed resin (sulfonated and quaternary ammonium polystyrene beads with a weight ratio of 40%:60%) by the electro-Fenton process. Mesh-type titanium metal that was coated with IrO2/RuO2 (Ti-DSA) was used as the anode and a stainless steel net was used as the cathode. The conversion of resins to soluble fragments and the removal of total organic carbon reached 92% and 99.4%, respectively, under conditions of solid loading=40gL−1, pH 2, applied current=2A, H2O2 flow rate=1.2mLmin−1, FeSO4
                     =20mMat 85°C. A pseudo first-order kinetic model of consecutive reactions specified that the efficacy of the electro-Fenton depended strongly on the slowly generated styrene in the aqueous phase by H2O2 and strong acid, which was rapidly mineralized by the hydroxyl radicals. The electro-Fenton process with reused iron catalyst was effective for treating ion exchange resin for at least for three runs, greatly reducing the volume of waste resin liquid.
