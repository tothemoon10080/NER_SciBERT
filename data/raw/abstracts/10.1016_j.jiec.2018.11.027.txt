We report on doxycycline (DOXY)-loaded calcium carbonate (CaCO3) mineralized nanoparticles (DOXY-MNPs) that can induce selective topical release of antibiotics to target oral plaque biofilms with acidic pH (ca. 4.5â€“5.5). The DOXY-MNPs were fabricated through a block copolymer-templated mineralization approach with simultaneous loading of an antibacterial drug, DOXY. The CaCO3 mineral core of DOXY-MNPs inhibited the leakage of entrapped DOXY in environments with normal salivary pH. However, in acidic pH, the DOXY release was triggered by the dissolution of CaCO3 mineral cores. The DOXY-MNPs showed effective antibacterial therapeutic activity to Prevotella intermedia bacterial cells with a potent treatment of biofilms.
