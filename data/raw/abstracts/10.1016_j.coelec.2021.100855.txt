The presence of recalcitrant organic compounds in wastewater poses a serious threat to the ecosystem and human health. Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes constitute a promising way for the mineralization of persistent organic compounds. They are commonly used for the transformation of organic pollutants into more biodegradable compounds or their complete removal from water. In this review, we present the recent advances in the use of boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes in the anodic oxidation process for the mineralization of real wastewater. First, the characteristic properties of BDD electrodes are discussed followed by the degradation mechanism. In addition, an overview on the application of BDD electrodes for mineralization of real wastewater is provided.
