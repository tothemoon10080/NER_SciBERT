As the poor dispersion of oily collectors and the inferior hydrophobicity of the mineral surface, the low-rank coal has an unsatisfactory flotation performance when using traditional collectors. In this paper, an ionic liquid microemulsion was used as a collector to enhance its floatability. Flotation test results demonstrated the microemulsion collector exhibited a superior collecting ability. A satisfactory separation performance of 78.66% combustible material recovery was obtained with the microemulsion collector consumption of 6 kg/t, which was equivalent to the flotation performance of diesel at a dosage of 25 kg/t. The dispersion behavior of the microemulsion collector was investigated using the Cryogenic-Transmission Electron Microscopy. The interaction mechanism of the microemulsion collector on enhancing the low-rank coal flotation was elucidated through the Zeta potential and contact angle measurements, the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The microemulsion collector exhibited superior dispersibility, which was dispersed into positively charged oil droplets with an average size of 160.21 nm in the pulp. Furthermore, the nano-oil droplets could be more efficiently adsorbed on the low-rank coal surface through electrostatic attraction, resulting in the improvement of its hydrophobicity. Thus, the microemulsion collector shows great application potential in improving the flotation performance of low-rank coal.
