Deep-sea ferromanganese minerals (manganese nodules and cobalt-rich crusts) are abundant in Co, Ni, Cu, Mn, and other metal resources, which are critical metals to support the development of clean energy technologies. Moreover, global industrialization has accelerated the consumption of terrestrial mineral resources, and the non-renewable terrestrial high-grade mineral resources are gradually decreasing or even tending to be depleted. Hence, the development of plentiful deep-sea ferromanganese minerals will be an inevitable choice for sustainable human development. There have been many reported methods for processing deep-sea ferromanganese minerals, mainly including physicochemical processing, hydrometallurgical processing, pyrometallurgical processing, and microbial leaching process. This review comprehensively summarizes the basic characteristics of deep-sea ferromanganese minerals, the metallogenic mechanism, and the related research on the processing methods of deep-sea ferromanganese minerals. The basic principles, reaction conditions, advantages, and disadvantages of various processing methods are also summarized. Meanwhile, the biomass reduction roasting-leaching and ammonium sulfate roasting-leaching methods with promising applications are discussed, and perspectives on the research of processing methods of deep-sea ferromanganese minerals are presented. This comprehensive review assists researchers in swiftly and efficiently understanding the advantages and limitations of each processing method, as well as the challenges for future research, while promoting the development of more efficient, environment-friendly, and economical processing methods.
