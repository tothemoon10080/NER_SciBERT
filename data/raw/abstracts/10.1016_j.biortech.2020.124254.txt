The aim of this work is to study for concurrent harvesting bioelectricity and struvite mineral from mineral rich wastewater containing with nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) contents using MFCs and a chemical precipitation system. Whole reaction was constructed to sequentially run hybrid reactor (consisting of MFCs and struvite precipitation), gravitational sedimentation, nitrogen purging and MFCs. The MFCs generated around 6.439 ± 0.481 mA and 2.084 ± 0.310 mW as I
                     max and P
                     max, respectively under 2g/l of COD. More than 70% of C source, and around 95% of P and N sources have been removed. Struvite mineral was precipitated in the hybrid reactor after the injection of Mg2+ and collected in sedimentation tank. Economic feasibility and beneficial concerns were carefully investigated, and it is proposed for applications in the “decentralised treatment process” of agriculture and livestock wastewater in order to realise circular and strong economy in agriculture by creating virtuous cycles.
