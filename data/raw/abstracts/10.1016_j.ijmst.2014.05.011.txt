To solve the problem of lack of water in arid areas and barren soil in the process of ecological restoration, the growth and drought resistance of Sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.) was studied by inoculation of AMF (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi), under drought stress. The results show that the inoculation of AMF can significantly improve the growth and mycorrhizal infection rate of Sainfoin and accelerate the absorption of water and nutrients by the roots compared with uninoculated plants. On the 40th day under drought stress, the relative water content, total nitrogen and total phosphorus content of the leaves of inoculated plants increased by 7.27%, 4.21% and 2.40%, respectively, the osmotic adjustment property in plant cells was improved, the protective enzyme system was improved and membrane lipid peroxidation was reduced. The inoculation of AMF can slow down the damage from drought, improve the drought resistance of Sainfoin, and will be of great significance to the ecologic restoration in arid areas.
