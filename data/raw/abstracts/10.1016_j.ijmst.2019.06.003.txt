Virtual reality (VR) simulations are some of the alternative practice environments for safety education. Trainees gain experience under the most realistic conditions without being exposed to any real hazard. Virtual reality also serves as a tool to expedite the decision-making process where quick decisions and actions are necessities for a safe operation. One example of such a situation in underground mines is the failure risks in a tunnel face after blasting. Ground support systems must be installed based on the stand-up time to ensure the safe access of personnel and equipment to the working area. Generally, a competent person inspects the area to identify risks and determines the required support systems. However, training of a competent person requires large amount of time and effort. This study presents virtual reality simulations developed for improving the assessment of the roof fall hazards and taking necessary measures for mitigating the risk related to roof fall. The virtual reality simulation involves decision-making tasks for a particular scenario in which participants can experience creating a safe working environment in a timely manner. First, they are asked to identify the potential hazard in a tunnel after blasting, namely, rock fall, wedge failure or groundwater inflow. If the hazard identification is successful, participants are requested to install rock bolts as a safety measure by selecting the bolt pattern (e.g. bolt length and spacing). Finally, participants evaluate the roof fall hazard by viewing displacements around the opening, before and after the support measures. This study illustrates the benefits of VR in safety training as well as enhancing the decision-making process to enhance safety.
