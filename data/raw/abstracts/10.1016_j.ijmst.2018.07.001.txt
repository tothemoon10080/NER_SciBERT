This paper presents a new risk assessment methodology for coal mine excavated slopes. This new empirical-statistical slope stability assessment methodology (SSAM) is intended for use by geotechnical engineers at both the design review and operational stages of a mine’s life to categorise the risk of an excavated coal mine slope. A likelihood of failure is determined using a new slope stability classification system for excavated coal mine slopes developed using a database of 119 intact and failed case studies sourced from open cut coal mines in Australia. Consequence of failure is based on slope height and stand-off distance at the toe of the excavated slope. Results are presented in a new risk matrix, with slope risk being divided into low, medium and high categories. The SSAM is put forward as a new risk assessment methodology to assess the potential for, and consequence of, excavated coal mine slope failure. Unlike existing classification systems, assumptions about the likely failure mode or mechanism are not required. Instead, the SSAM applies an approach which compares the conditions present within the excavated slope face, with the known past performance of slopes with similar geotechnical and geometrical conditions, to estimate the slope’s propensity for failure. The SSAM is novel in that it considers the depositional history of strata in an excavated slope and how this sequence affects slope stability. It is further novel in that it does not require explicit measurements of intact rock, rock mass and/or defect strength to rapidly calculate a slope’s likelihood of failure and overall risk. Ratings can be determined entirely from visual observations of the excavated slope face. The new SSAM is designed to be used in conjunction with existing slope stability assessment tools.
