This study modeled the effects of structural and dimensional manipulations on hydrodynamic behavior of a bench vertical current classifier. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach was used as modeling method, and turbulent intensity and fluid velocity were applied as system responses to predict the overflow cut size variations. These investigations showed that cut size would decrease by increasing diameter and height of the separation column and cone section depth, due to the decrease of turbulent intensity and fluid velocity. As the size of discharge gate increases, the overflow cut-size would decrease due to freely fluid stream out of the column. The overflow cut-size was significantly increased in downward fed classifier compared to that fed by upward fluid stream. In addition, reforming the shape of angular overflow outletâ€™s weir into the curved form prevented stream inside returning and consequently unselective cut-size decreasing.
