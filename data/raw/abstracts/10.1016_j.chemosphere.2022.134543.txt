In-situ super-stable mineralization technology with mineralizers (CaSO4, Fe2(SO4)3) and attapulgite (ATP) clay were applied to improve soda saline-alkali soil. The addition of mineralizers and the existence of OH and CO3
                     2− in soil resulted in the formation of CaFe-layered double hydroxide (CaFe-LDH) with super-stable mineralization structure (K
                     sp = 1.512 × 10−61), which was confirmed by the characterization of physicochemical properties and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The fixation of OH− and CO3
                     2− during the formation process of CaFe-LDH led to the transformation of the existing forms of OH− and CO3
                     2− in soil from free to stable state, resulting in the permanent decrease of soil pH and CO3
                     2− concentration. The effect of ATP clay on the decrease of soluble Na ions in soil through electrostatic attraction and cation exchange was also indicated. Furthermore, mineralizers (1.2 t/ha CaSO4 and 0.75 t/ha Fe2(SO4)3) and ATP clay (1.2 t/ha) were applied to 1.33 ha soda saline-alkali land, and Rumex patientia L. was seeded meanwhile for the identification of improved performance. After five months of improvement, the physical and chemical properties of soil were improved that pH, electrical conductivity (EC), the concentration of CO3
                     2− and soluble Na ions, and soil bulk density decreased significantly. In addition, the emergence rate of Rumex patientia L. increased from 0% to 98.3%. All above indicated that in-situ super-stable mineralization technology with the properties of high efficiency, long-term and cost-effective (234.88 $/ha) displays excellent potential in the improvement of soda saline-alkali soil.
