Knowledge of the key factors regulating soil organic carbon (OC) mineralization in response to fertilizers and lime application is essential to understanding the effects of agricultural land management on soil OC preservation. Microbial community composition and OC availability to microorganisms have been proposed as the two most imperative factors controlling soil OC mineralization, although their relative importance is still under debate. Here we performed a laboratory incubation in combination with high-throughput sequencing and structural equation modeling to examine the mechanisms underlying the responses of OC mineralization in the topsoil and the subsoil of a volcanic soil (an Andosol) to the additions of lime and/or phosphate. Results showed that lime and/or phosphate additions induced distinct shifts in the microbial community composition and functional profiles in the topsoil and the subsoil. We found that OC mineralization relied on microbial community composition and functionality in the topsoil but was strongly related to the quality and quantity of the water-extractable OC (indicative of the OC availability) in the subsoil. These data suggest that the key regulator controlling the response of OC mineralization to lime and/or P additions shifts from microbial community composition to OC availability as soil depth increases in the Andosol. Our findings highlight the central role of mechanisms controlling soil OC mineralization in regulating the responses of mineralization to intensive agricultural management practices.
