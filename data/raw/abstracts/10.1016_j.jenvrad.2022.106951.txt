226Ra is an ultra-trace element with important environmental implications for many industries (including water treatment and oil and mineral extraction). Its extremely low concentrations in natural environments do not allow for direct observation and measurement of the 226Ra-bearing minerals governing 226Ra mobility. To better understand the retention processes for 226Ra in rocks and soil, a synthesized assemblage of 226Ra-doped minerals was made, combining montmorillonite, ferrihydrite and barite. A new methodology was developed using alpha activity maps acquired using alpha autoradiography, and elemental maps by using SEM/EDS. These maps were processed using a global approach, considering the entirety of the signal. The comparison of the alpha activity map and the elemental map enabled a correlation to be established between the 226Ra activity and the chemical composition and identification of the main 226Ra-bearing mineral of the assemblage, from which we were able to estimate the contribution of each mineral to the total activity of the assemblage, and to quantify the 226Ra-activity for each mineral.
                  This methodology makes it possible to link mineralogy and occurrence of 226Ra at the scale of the mineral (tens of Î¼m). It can be applied to natural samples, including fine-grained samples with a complex mineralogy.
