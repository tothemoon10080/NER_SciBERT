In order to avoid the deep-well oil shale roadway being deformed, damaged, or difficult to maintain after excavating and supporting in Haishiwan coal mine, this paper has analyzed the characteristics of the deformed roadway and revealed its failure mechanism by taking comprehensively the methods of field geological investigation, displacement monitoring of surrounding rock, rock properties and hydration properties experiments and field application tests. Based on this work, the high-resistance controlled yielding supporting principle is proposed, which is: to “resist” by high pre-tightening force and high stiffness in the early stage, to “yield” by making use of the controlled deformation of a yielding tube in the middle stage, and to “fix” by applying total-section Gunite in the later stage. A high-resistance controlled yielding supporting technique of “high pre-tightening force yielding anchor bolt+small-bore pre-tightening force anchor cable+rebar ladder beam+rhombic metal mesh+lagging gunite” has been established, and industrial on site testing implemented. The practical results show that the high-resistance controlled yielding supporting technique can effectively control the large deformation and long-time rheology of deep-well oil shale roadways and can provide beneficial references for the maintenance of other con-generic roadways.
