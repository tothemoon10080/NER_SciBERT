Roof and rib instability is an important issue in underground mining. To optimize ground support design, enhance ground stability, and reduce the possibility of roof or rib failure with minimal use of artificial ground support, it is essential to have an accurate understanding of ground conditions. This includes the location of voids, cracks, and discontinuities, as well as information about the different strata in the immediate roof. This paper briefly introduces ongoing research on void detection by using the roof bolter feed and rotation pressure. The goal of this project is to improve the sensitivity of detection programs to locate smaller joints and reduce the number of false alarms. This paper presents a brief review of the testing procedures, data analysis, logic, and algorithms used for void detection. In addition, this paper discusses the results of preliminary laboratory tests and statistical analysis of the data from these two drilling parameters used for void detection.
