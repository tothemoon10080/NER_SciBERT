Natural background gamma radiation emanating from the radionuclides, which are present in the earth crust and materials used for construction, is inescapable feature for human beings. In the present study, a village “Peddamula” selected to estimate the natural background gamma radiation levels in the indoor and outdoor and activity of radionuclides in the soil samples, due to its proximity with proposed uranium mineralized area. The estimated gamma radiation levels with TLDs found to vary from 881 to 2017 μGy.y−1 with an average 1413 ± 248 μGy.y−1 in indoor. The activity of radionuclides estimated for U238, Th232 and K40 from soil samples are 163 ± 12 Bq.Kg−1, 176 ± 14 Bq.Kg−1 and 586 ± 46 Bq.Kg−1, respectively. The ratios between indoor and outdoor gamma radiation levels are found to be 1.14 and the estimated annual effective dose due to natural background gamma radiation is 1.14 ± 0.36 mSv.y−1. The Radium equivalent activity, Internal and External hazard index are also estimated and presented in the paper.
