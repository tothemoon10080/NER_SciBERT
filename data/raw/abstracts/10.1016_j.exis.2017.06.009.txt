The mixed results from the recent implementation of a wave of policies that aim to encourage the downstream processing of minerals – mainly in developing countries – have highlighted the need for research to better guide and support policy-making in this area. Specifically, it is crucial to determine whether mineral producing countries can or should intervene in the processing location of minerals, and if so how to go about doing so. This paper highlights these concerns by broadening our understanding of the location determinants of downstream mineral processing. We argue that researchers must move beyond the more descriptive linkage theory and Global Value Chain (GVC) and Global Production Network (GPN) approaches to incorporate New Economic Geography (NEG) theories, to improve awareness of location decisions’ determinants. A profound understanding of these determinants is imperative to determine policy measures capable of influencing location outcomes. This must be complemented with an identification and evaluation of the policy options available to mineral producing countries in order to attract – or maintain – downstream processing.
