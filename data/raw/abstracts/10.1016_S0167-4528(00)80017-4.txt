The basic model describing the separation of grained materials is the following equation
                        
                           g
                           (
                           x
                           )
                           =
                           (
                           1
                           −
                           γ
                           )
                           ⋅
                           h
                           (
                           x
                           )
                           +
                           γ
                           
                              
                                 
                                    ∫
                                    D
                                 
                                 
                                    p
                                    (
                                    w
                                    ,
                                    x
                                    )
                                    f
                                    (
                                    w
                                    )
                                    d
                                    w
                                 
                              
                           
                        
                     where: g(x) is the function of distribution density of probability of the feature X, determining the separation into products, h(x) is a similar function as g(x) for the material which constituted the products existing before the process in which the probabilities of transfer from the fraction (w, w + dw) are determined by p(w,x), f(w) is the function of density determining the material composition according to the feature W; the parameter 0 <γ <1 determines the proportion of products existing and formed in the process of separation while D is the range of changes of values of the random variable W. In mineral processing data are not available for each conditional distribution separately but only for the overall mixture distribution. Often such situation arise because it is impossible to observe some underlying variable which splits the observations into classes only the combined distribution can be studied. In these circumstances interest often focuses on estimating the mixing proportions and on estimating the mixing proportions and on estimating the parameters in the conditional distributions. The results of such investigations permit to better interpret the course of processes and the behavior of materials.
