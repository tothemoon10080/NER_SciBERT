Efficient removal of copper complexes is a challenging issue due to their robust stability and solubility. In this study, CoFe2O4–Co0 loaded sludge-derived biochar (MSBC), a magnetic heterogeneous catalyst, was prepared to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for the decomplexation and mineralization of some typical copper complexes (including Cu(Ⅱ)-EDTA, Cu(Ⅱ)-NTA, Cu(Ⅱ)-citrate, and Cu(Ⅱ)-tartrate). The results showed that abundant cobalt ferrite and cobalt nanoparticles were decorated in the plate-like carbonaceous matrix, making it a higher degree of graphitization, better conductivity and more excellent catalytic activity than the raw biochar. Cu(Ⅱ)-EDTA was chosen as the representative copper complex. Under the optimum condition, the decomplexation and mineralization efficiency of Cu(Ⅱ)-EDTA in MSBC/PMS system were 98% and 68% within 20 min, respectively. The mechanistic investigation confirmed that the activation of PMS by MSBC followed both a radical pathway contributed by SO4
                     •− and •OH and a nonradical pathway contributed by 1O2. In addition, the electron transfer pathway between Cu(Ⅱ)-EDTA and PMS facilitated the decomplexation of Cu(Ⅱ)-EDTA. Jointly, CO, Co0, and the redox cycles of Co(Ⅲ)/Co(Ⅱ) and Fe (Ⅲ)/Fe (Ⅱ) were found to play a critical role in the decomplexation process. Overall, the MSBC/PMS system provides a new strategy for efficient decomplexation and mineralization of copper complexes.
