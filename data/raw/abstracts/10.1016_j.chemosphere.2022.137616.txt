The advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) driven by iron-based materials are the highly efficient technology for refractory organic pollutants treatment. In this work, self-modified iron-based catalysts were prepared using secondary mineral as the precursor by one-step pyrolysis process without additional dopants. The prepared catalysts exhibited excellent performance in catalytic degradation of florfenicol (FF), especially C-AJ, which was derived from ammoniojarosite [(NH4, H3O)Fe3(OH)6(SO4)2], activated PDS to degrade 93% FF with initial concentration of 50 mg/L. Quenching tests and electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR) studies showed that SO4
                     •−, •OH, and •O2
                     − were the main reactive species for FF degradation and their contribution degree was SO4
                     •− > •OH > •O2
                     −. The Fe0 and the cycle of Fe(II)/Fe(III) both contributed to the PDS activation, and the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) was accelerated by S2− on the catalyst surface. In addition, Fe3O4 on the C-AJ indirectly catalyzes PDS by promoting electron transfer. The effects of catalyst dosage, PDS concentration, pH, inorganic anions, and real aqueous matrices on FF degradation, TOC analysis, and cycling test were investigated. The results showed that iron-based catalysts have superior environmental durability due to their excellent catalytic properties in the real aqueous matrices with common inorganic anions and pH 3–9 and its steady catalytic capacity with multiple cycles. Overall, this study sheds new light on the rational design of self-modified iron-based composite and develops low-cost technology toward remediation of FF-contaminated wastewater.
