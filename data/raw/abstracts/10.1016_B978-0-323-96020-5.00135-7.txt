This chapter explores the impact of various processes about the mining and mineral processing industries, on the environment and society as a whole. These industries extract minerals and metals from the earth, which requires a lot of resources and energy. This can lead to air and water pollution, deforestation, and destruction of habitats for wildlife. This chapter also explores the social and economic impacts of mining, such as forced relocation, community clashes, and labor exploitation. It emphasizes the importance of adopting sustainable mining practices that prioritize environmental and social responsibility while also ensuring economic development. The impact and the corrective measures suggested in this chapter can prove a valuable resource for policymakers, industry leaders, and researchers who wish to understand the harmful effects of mining and mineral-based industries and take steps toward reducing them.
