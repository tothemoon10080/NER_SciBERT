Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) seeds were processed by various processing techniques (wet heating, microwave processing, dry heating, soaking, and extrusion) intended to reduce its antinutrients and enhance its functional properties and bioactive potential. The effect of aforesaid processing treatments was evaluated on cooking quality, functional properties, antinutrients, bioactive constituents, antioxidant activity, and mineral profile of alfalfa. All the processing treatments improved the cooking quality of alfalfa seeds. Wet heating and soaking treatment particularly exhibited pronounced improvement in all the functional properties of alfalfa flour discerned in terms of better hydration, surface active, and gelation properties. Furthermore, all processing treatments conferred improved freeze and refrigeration thaw stability to alfalfa flour (except dry heat treatment). Thermal processing treatments were more effective in reducing the trypsin inhibitor (77.29–100%) and lectin activity (100%) in comparison to soaking (that reduced only tannins (31.40%). In addition, all the thermal processing treatments enhanced the bioactive constituents, antioxidant activity and mineral profile of alfalfa seeds contrary to soaking treatment. Wet heat processing (110 °C for 10 min) was most effective method for processing alfalfa to improve its potentiality for utilization.
