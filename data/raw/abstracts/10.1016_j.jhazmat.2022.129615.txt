Once microplastics (MPs) enter the terrestrial ecosystem, they may affect the assessment of soil carbon storage and the fluxes of greenhouse gases. This study showed microbial incubation diminished the size and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content of MPs and introduced more oxygen-containing functional groups to MPs potentially through microbial colonization. The aged MPs generally showed higher carbon mineralization ratio (0.010–0.876 %) than the pristine MPs (0.007–0.189 %), which was supported by their higher enzyme activities and DOC content. Interestingly, four model minerals increased the DOC release and CO2 emission from MPs by altering MPs physicochemical properties and shaping the habitat for microbial growth. The higher enzyme activities in mineral artificial soils, except for montmorillonite, served as a potential valid explanation for their higher mineralization. The high CO2 emission but low enzyme activity in montmorillonite artificial soil was due to most DOC being already mineralized. Aging and minerals altered the microflora and enhanced the expression of some C metabolism- and N-related functional genes, which supplemented the cause of higher CO2 and N2O emissions from the corresponding artificial soils. Overall, the increased biomineralization of MPs carbon by minerals was divergent from the protective role of minerals on soil organic carbon.
