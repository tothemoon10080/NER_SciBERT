From their ancient beginnings to the present day, coagulants and flocculants, used to enhance solid–liquid separation by particle aggregation, are described; particular reference is given to developments in the mineral processing industry. The impact of polyacrylamide-based flocculants on technical effectiveness, disposal possibilities and environmental control, over the last 40 years, has had a profound effect on the efficiency and design of solid–liquid separation equipment. Recent developments, in terms of molecular architecture, offer new horizons for the future at a time when requirements for separating solid particles from liquid are becoming more demanding in the minerals industry.
