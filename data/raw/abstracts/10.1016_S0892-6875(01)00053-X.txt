The PlantStar 2000 was developed as a plant-wide control platform for the minerals processing industry. It is a platform which allows for the combination of any number of control strategies into a single control system.
                  PlantStar utilises a 3-layer approach to the management of metallurgical processes. The first layer is that of Process Stabilisation â€” essential before a system can be successfully optimised. This layer incorporates a selection of advanced control strategies. Process Optimisation is the second layer, providing Expert System functionality in an easy-to-use environment. The final layer is that of Process Management, enabling easy access to PlantStar from anywhere on the plant or even via the Internet, making monitoring of plant operation much easier. The inclusion of OPC-technology in PlantStar will ensure PlantStar's compatibility with other OPC-compliant applications. Thus, it will be possible to integrate PlantStar with existing plant control systems.
                  PlantStar will initially be available for control and optimisation of milling and flotation processes. It can incorporate the functionality and control strategies of Mintek's MillStar and FloatStar systems. New control strategies currently being investigated by Mintek (eg cyanide control on gold plants) will become available as modules, enabling the PlantStar 2000 to ultimately be used in the control of most sections of a minerals processing plant.
