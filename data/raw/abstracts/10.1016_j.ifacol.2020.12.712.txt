In this paper, the application of deep learning in the mining and processing of ores is reviewed. Deep learning is strongly impacting the development of sensor systems, particularly computer vision systems used in mining and mineral processing automation, where it is filling a gap not currently achievable by traditional approaches. To a lesser extent, deep learning is also being considered in the automation of decision support systems. There is significant scope for the application of deep learning to improve operations, but access to industrial data and big data infrastructure in operational environments are critical bottlenecks to the development and deployment of the technology.
