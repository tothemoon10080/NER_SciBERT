The antibacterial activity (ABA) of honey is associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), where polyphenols (PFs) play a key role due to their pro-oxidant action modulated by metallic cations. In this work, the contents of PFs, H2O2, OH radicals, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, and ABA against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined in honeys from central Chile. Then, their relationships were evaluated through partial least squares regression. The average contents of phenolic acids, flavonoids and metals in honey ranged from 0.4 to 4 μg/g, 0.3–1.5 μg/g and 3–6 μg/g, respectively. All honeys showed accumulation of H2O2 (1–35 μg/g) and OH radicals. The PLS showed that gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, chrysin, kaempferol, Fe, and Mn stimulate the generation of ROS. Quercetin, Cu, and Zn showed marginal antioxidant effects. PFs favor the ABA of honey against both bacteria and H2O2 against S. epidermidis.
