A food product matrix and functional additives used to manufacture it are one of the key factors influencing the fermentation processes in the intestine and the bioavailability of minerals. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of acidified and non-acidified milk gels with highly-purified (1-3)-, (1-3)(1-4)-, and (1-3)(1-6)-β-glucan on: gastrointestinal tract parameters, intestinal metabolic activity, and bioavailability of minerals in growing rats. Concentrations of ammonia, short-chain volatile fatty acids as well as bacterial enzyme activity, blood biochemistry, and bioavailability of Ca, Zn, Mn and Fe were significantly affected by β-glucan structure. The availability of minerals was higher upon the use of branched β-glucans. Milk gel acidity significantly influenced body weight gain, activity of faecal bacterial enzymes, blood levels of triglycerides and glucose, and bioavailability of all investigated mineral compounds. The use of branched β-glucans resulted in the most and least intense fermentation processes in the caecum, respectively.
