Microbial–mineral interfacial reactions are crucial in the development and functioning of soil. We present basic mechanisms by which microorganisms and the polymers they secrete attach to mineral surfaces, followed by discussion on three fundamental consequences of these reactions: weathering (including secondary mineral formation), element cycling (including organic matter turnover and accumulation), and formation of physical structure in soil. We also point out potentially important questions arising from the microbe–organic matter–mineral interactions.
