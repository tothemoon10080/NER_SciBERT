Bone tissue engineering scaffolds constructed from single-component organic materials have inherent limitations. Inspired by the hierarchical structure of physiological natural bone hard tissues, our research explores the construction of organic-inorganic composite scaffold for bone regeneration. In this study, we used a natural and readily obtainable extracellular matrix (ECM) material, i.e., decellularized small intestinal submucosa (SIS), to build the organic component of a phosphorylated hydroxyapatite nanocrystal-containing composite scaffold (nHA@SIS). Guided by polymer-induced liquid-precursor theory, we introduced a soluble inorganic mineralization solution to achieve an inorganic component of nHA@SIS. Using in situ mineralization, we successfully formed inorganic component within SIS and constructed nHA@SIS composite scaffold. We analyzed the physicochemical properties and the osteogenic role of nHA@SIS via a series of in vitro and in vivo studies. Compared with SIS scaffold, the nHA@SIS possessed suitable physicochemical properties, maintained the excellent cell activity of SIS and better guided reorganization of the cell skeleton, thereby achieving superior osteoconductivity and maintaining osteoinductivity at the protein and gene levels. Furthermore, the rat cranial defect area in the nHA@SIS scaffold group was mostly repaired after 12 weeks of implantation, with a larger amount of higher-density new bone tissue being visible at the edge and center than SIS and blank control group. This significantly improved in vivo osteogenic ability indicated the great potential of nHA@SIS for bone tissue engineering applications.
