The biocompatibility of biomedical materials is vital to their applicability and functionality. However, modifying surfaces for enhanced biocompatibility using traditional surface treatment techniques is challenging. We employed a mineralizing elastin-like recombinamer (ELR) self-assembling platform to mediate mineralization on Zr-16Nb-xTi (x = 4,16 wt%) alloy surfaces, resulting in the modification of surface morphology and bioactivity while improving the biocompatibility of the material. We modulated the level of nanocrystal organization by adjusting the cross-linker ratio. Nanoindentation tests revealed that the mineralized configuration had nonuniformity with respect to Young's modulus and hardness, with the center areas having higher values (5.626 ± 0.109 GPa and 0.264 ± 0.022 GPa) compared to the edges (4.282 ± 0.327 GPa and 0.143 ± 0.023 GPa). The Scratch test results indicated high bonding strength (2.668 ± 0.117 N) between the mineralized coating and the substrate. Mineralized Zr-16Nb-xTi (x = 4,16 wt%) alloys had higher viability compared to untreated alloys, which exhibited high cell viability (>100 %) after 5 days and high alkaline phosphatase activity after 7 days. Cell proliferation assays indicated that MG 63 cells grew faster on mineralized surfaces than on untreated surfaces. Scanning electron microscopy imaging confirmed that the cells adhered and spread well on mineralized surfaces. Furthermore, hemocompatibility test results revealed that all mineralized samples were non-hemolytic. Our results demonstrate the viability of employing the ELR mineralizing platform to improve alloy biocompatibility.
