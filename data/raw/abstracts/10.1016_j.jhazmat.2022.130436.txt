Surface hydroxyl groups play a decisive role in the generation of hydroxyl radicals with stronger oxidizing ability, which is indispensable in photocatalytic VOCs removal, especially under the condition of low humidity. In this work, non-noble amorphous SnO2 decorated ZnSn(OH)6 (ZSH) was synthesized by an in-situ method. The charge transport, reactant activation and hydroxyl polarization are enhanced through decoration of amorphous SnO2 on ZSH. Combined with the designed experiment, in-situ EPR, DTF calculation and in-situ DRIFTS, the role and mechanism of interfacial hydroxyl polarization are revealed on SnO2 decorated ZnSn(OH)6. Compared with pristine ZSH and noble-metal modified ZSH, the toluene degradation rate of amorphous SnO2 decorated ZSH is increased by 13.0 and 3.8 times, and the toluene mineralization rate is increased by 5.2 and 2.2 times. The ZSH-24 sample maintains a high toluene degradation activity after 6 cyclic utilization without catalyst deactivation. This work emphasizes the role of non-noble metal and the origin of hydroxyl group polarization on ZnSn(OH)6 for photocatalytic VOCs mineralization.
