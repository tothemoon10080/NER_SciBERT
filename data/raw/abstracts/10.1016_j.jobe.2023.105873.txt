In recent years, environmental pollution and resource shortages have increased demand for high-performance green concrete. This study investigated the use of manufactured basalt sand as fine aggregate and mineral admixtures as a partial replacement for cement with a focus on the basic mechanical properties of concrete as well as water absorption, porosity, and resistivity. The use of manufactured basalt sand as fine aggregate was shown to enhance the mechanical properties. The inclusion of mineral admixture equivalent to 30% of the total cementitious material (15% fly ash and 15% ground granulated blast furnace slag) resulted in the best mechanical properties with few pores and low water absorption consistent with rich hydration products.
