The synthesized CaAl-layered double hydroxide (CaAl-LDH) shows excellent performance in potentially toxic metals (PTMs) removal, and the removal capacity of CaAl-LDH toward Cu2+, Zn2+ and Pb2+ in aqueous solution is 502.4, 315.2 and 600.0Â mg/g respectively. Cu2+ and Zn2+ are removed through isomorphic substitution of laminate Ca and dissolution-reprecipitation, leading to the formation of CuAl-LDH and ZnAl-LDH mineralization products. Pb2+ is removed by the complexation and precipitation to form Pb3(CO3)2(OH)2. The application of CaAl-LDH in laboratory-scale soil remediation shows that target PTMs are gradually mineralized into relatively stable oxidizable and residual state, and the immobilization efficiency of available Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb reaches 84.62 %, 98.66 %, 96.81 % and 70.27 % respectively. In addition, practical application in farmland results in the significant reduction of available Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb with the immobilization efficiency of 30.15 %, 67.30 % and 57.80 % and 38.71 % respectively. Owing to the super-stable mineralization effect of CaAl-LDH, the content of PTMs in the roots, stems and grains of cultivated buckwheat also decreases obviously, and the growth and yield of buckwheat are not adversely affected but improved. The above prove that the super-stable mineralization based on CaAl-LDH is a promising scheme for the remediation of PTMs contaminated agriculture soil.
