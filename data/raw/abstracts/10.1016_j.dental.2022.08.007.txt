Objectives
                  This study evaluated the effect of TiO2 nanoparticles + dense hydroxyapatite (HA) on human osteoblast cells (SAOS-2).
               
                  Methods
                  Particulate bovine HA powder with or without the addition of either 5 or 8 % TiO2 (HA, HA/TiO2Np5 % or HA/TiO2Np8 %) were pressed into disks (Ø = 12.5 mm; thickness = 1.3 mm) uniaxially (100 MPa) and isostatically (200 MPa/1 min) and sintered at 1300 °C. Y-TZP disks were used as control. The following tests were performed: Scanning Electron Microscopy and Dispersive Energy Spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), cell viability assay (Alamar Blue-AB) and mineralized matrix deposition (Alizarin Red-AR). AB and AR data were submitted to 2-way ANOVA/Tukey tests and ANOVA/Tukey tests, respectively.
               
                  Results
                  SEM revealed that the surface of HA/TiO2Np5% resembles DPBHA surface, but also contains smaller granules. HA/TiO2Np8% characteristics resembles HA/TiO2Np5% surface, but with irregular topography. Y-TZP showed a typical oxide ceramic surface pattern. EDS revealed Ca, O, and P in all samples. C, O, and Zr appeared in Y-TZP samples. AFM data corroborates SEM analysis. AB test revealed excellent cellular viability for HA/TiO2Np5% group. AR test showed that all groups containing TiO2np had more mineralized matrix deposition than all other groups, with statistically differences between HA/TiO2Np8% and HA cultivated in non-osteogenic medium. Culture in osteogenic medium exhibited much more mineralized matrix deposition by TiO2np groups.
               
                  Significance
                  In conclusion, the addition of TiO2np showed chemical, superficial, and biological changes in the reinforced materials. HA/TiO2Np5% showed the best results for cell viability and HA/TiO2Np8% for mineralized matrix deposition.
