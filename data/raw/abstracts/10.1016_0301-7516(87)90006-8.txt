This paper proposes an extension to an already available mass balance algorithm for mineral processing data. A typical set of data which can be processed by the proposed method contains flowrates measurement, particle-size analyses, global chemical analyses and, simultaneously, chemical analyses within particle-size classes. The method which is developed is based on a suboptimal approximation of a weighted least-squares procedure where the mass conservation equations, including the coherency constraints between the chemical analyses within particle-size class and the global analyses, act as constraints of the optimization problem. An illustration for the grinding circuit of a uranium-bearing phosphate ore is given.
