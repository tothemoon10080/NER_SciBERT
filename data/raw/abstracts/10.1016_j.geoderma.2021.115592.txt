Inorganic P is adsorbed by a variety of soil minerals. For acidic subtropical Alfisols with high contents of both (hydr)oxides and clay minerals, there is an underappreciated understanding of the importance of clay minerals to P species and availability varying with soil pH and P concentration. In this study, the rate and equilibrium of P adsorption in a subtropical Alfisol were investigated by combining soil incubation with three types of P fertilizer with multi-surface modelling. Phosphorus species analysis revealed that most of the P was present in the forms of Al-P and Fe-P in the subtropical Alfisol. The multi-surface model calculation showed that goethite, kaolinite, and illite were the most important soil constituents responsible for the immobilization of P. Clay minerals were as important as Al/Fe (hydr)oxides for P adsorption in the subtropical Alfisol. In addition, there was a highly positive linear correlation between P adsorbed by illite and Olsen P, with a slope of approximately to 1. The model analysis also showed that >99% of the P adsorbed by illite was in the form of

                     . These results suggest the important role of illite in controlling P availability and that P adsorption by illite may serve as an indicator of P availability in the subtropical Alfisol.
