Interactions between alkali metals in biomass and silicon and aluminum minerals in petroleum coke (PC) are closely related to the gasification reactivity and the deactivation of active K-catalyst during co-gasification. This study comprehensively investigated the evolution of K-containing minerals and their impact on the gasification reactivity and ash fusion characteristics during the co-gasification of PC and wheat straw (WS). The results showed that the addition of WS improved the gasification reactivity of PC, but only up to a certain point due to the K-containing mineral evolutions at high temperatures. Adding WS below 20 wt% resulted in the deactivation of K and the formation of inert kaliophilite and nepheline. However, when WS addition exceeded 20 wt%, a substantial amount of K acted as an active K-catalyst, significantly increasing gasification reactivity. The shrinking core model was found to be more appropriate than the homogeneous model when considering gasification kinetics during co-gasification.
