This study explores efficient Sicomet Green (SG) dye degradation using Fe(III)/Lig and Fe(II)/Lig complexes in modified photo-Fenton processes under UV, LED, and sunlight. Sunlight irradiation showed rapid kinetics with over 70% degradation efficiency. Multi-objective grey wolf optimization achieved 98% degradation and 96% mineralization yield using Fe(III)/Lig without pH adjustment. Inorganic ions inhibited the modified photo-Fenton process. A user-friendly app aided predictions and optimal parameters selection, emphasizing natural light sources and pH-neutral medium for dye removal through photo-Fenton.
