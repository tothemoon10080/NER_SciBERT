We report on the development of a linear process model of energy supplies and uses in the province of Ontario (Canada). The minerals industries producing metals account for a large part of industrial energy use in Ontario. Therefore, the emphasis in this model is on the iron and steel, copper, nickel, and zinc industries, which are described in some detail. On the other hand, by using the model, we keep a global perspective and embed these industries in a general energy model of the whole province. Two scenarios are run and analyzed to demonstrate the model capabilities.
