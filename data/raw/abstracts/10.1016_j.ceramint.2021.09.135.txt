Most research activities in the nuclear mining industries are directed to separation of heavy and radioactive minerals from rocks and sediments. This process is completed without utilizing tailing and mineral waste materials. Tailing materials containing radioactive wastes are considered as a major environmental problem; especially with increasing the exploration of metals and lower grade mineral deposits. In the present work, borosilicate glass could be prepared for immobilizing these nuclear wastes in the designing compositions by melting at 1200–1250 °C. NaI (TI) gamma-ray spectroscopy system was used to detect 238U, 232Th, 226Ra, and 40K concentrations in tailing materials and prepared glass to emphasize their safe dose. The produced glass was characterized by XRD, SEM, FTIR, and UV spectrophotometer. Vickers hardness and leaching properties were also studied. The results showed that compact - structured glass with high durability towards groundwater was obtained. All studied environmental parameters indicated that the glass radiation dose was lower compared to international averages, thus the glass can be safely used in nuclear waste immobilization.
