Mineral exploration is a complex process involving rigorous field work to collect data and conceptualization to fit the data into a plausible theory. Mineral exploration proceeds step by step taking into account aerial photographs, satellite imagery, geological maps, geophysical maps, and geochemical maps to delineate areas of interest. Data generated by these techniques are stored in a thematic and textual database using suitable software. Various techniques of combining and compressing these data have developed over the years, where computers play an important part. These data can be utilized for 2D or 3D modeling or for data mining. The data can be selectively combined to obtain information for likely locating of ore deposits.
               Different techniques of data modeling and data interpretation that have recently developed are discussed and how and where they have been used has been described briefly.
