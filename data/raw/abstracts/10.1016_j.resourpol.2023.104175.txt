The depletion of mineral resources directly impacts energy use, affecting energy extraction, CO2 intensity, and natural resource sustainability. This, in turn, affects the ability of countries to meet their energy needs, as well as their ability to remain environmentally sustainable. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that countries have access to the minerals needed to extract and produce energy to reduce the impact of mineral resource depletion on energy use. This paper examines the nexus between mineral depletion and energy use in China from 1971 to 2019, using energy depletion, CO2 intensity, and natural resource sustainability as moderating variables. The result shows that energy use positively relates to mineral depletion, energy depletion, and CO2 intensity. Furthermore, energy use is negatively related to natural resource sustainability. This indicates that mineral depletion, energy depletion, and CO2 intensity increase as energy use increases while natural resource sustainability decreases. An increase of 1% in mineral depletion in China results in an increase of 0.326651% in energy consumption. Energy use in China increases by 0.487448% for every 1% increase in energy depletion. A 1% increase in CO2 intensity in China leads to a 1.5866531% increase in energy use. Increasing the sustainability of natural resources in China by just 1% can result in a 0.924807% decrease in energy consumption. Policymakers are suggested to employ strategies to reduce waste, increase efficiency, and promote using alternative resources. Governments and organizations must also ensure that natural resources are not depleted beyond repair to ensure that future generations can access the necessary resources.
