Traditional mineral processing technologies are finding application in the environmental arena for remediation (cleanup) and recycling processes. This paper presents examples of ways in which crushing and grinding, sizing, washing and scrubbing, gravity concentration, magnetic separation, and liquid/solid separation have been effectively used in environmental applications. Specific reference is given to comminution of a low-level nuclear waste as feed preparation for stabilization,magnetic separation of hazardous brass forndry sand waste to recycle steel shot, brass, and sand, and a process proposed for remediating a battery recycle site in Oregon.
