Clay minerals, such as bentonite, are used as feed additives capable of adsorbing mycotoxins and heavy metals and have been related to many positive effects on animal health and productivity. However, these compounds seem to induce also side effects and to interact with the intestinal and ruminal microbiota. The present in vitro study is aimed at evaluating the effects of different doses of bentonite on ruminal fermentations, metabolome and mineral content. Five doses of bentonite (0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 50 mg in 150 mL total volume) were incubated (39 °C for 24 h) with a dairy cow Total Mixed Ratio (TMR) and the ruminal fluid obtained from one healthy Holstein lactating cow. The kinetics of gas production (GP) continuously monitored during the incubation evidenced no significant differences in either cumulative GP (mL/g DM) or GP rate (mL/g DM/h) between the treatment groups. After the incubation, metabolome and mineral content of treated ruminal fluids were studied in pooled replicate samples by 1H NMR spectroscopy and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES), respectively. The NMR analysis led to the identification of 20 metabolites and suggested a clear metabolic differentiation among treatments. The ICP-OES analysis suggested that the addition of bentonite affected the concentration of Al, Ba, Ca, Cr, Mn, Mo and Sr. It is conceivable that bentonite administration does not affect gross ruminal fermentations, while it seems to modify the ruminal metabolome and the concentrations of few minerals in ruminal fluid.
