The photooxidative mineralizations of two microorganisms-produced glycolipid biosurfactants 4-O-(4′,6′-di-O-acetyl-2′,3′-di-O-alkanoyl-β-d-mannopyranosyl)-d-erythritol (MEL-A) and 1-O-(6′-O-acetyl-2′,3′-di-O-alkanoyl-β-d-mannopyranosyl)-d-erythritol (MEL-B) were examined by monitoring the temporal changes in UV absorption, the time profiles of CO2 evolution and the changes in interfacial tension occurring by an advanced oxidation process in the presence of a metal-oxide (TiO2). Features of their mineralization are compared to the photomineralization of the anionic dodecylbenzene sulfonate (DBS) surfactant carried out under otherwise identical conditions. The adsorption of surfactants on the TiO2 surface and the positions of attack of the photogenerated OH radicals on the surfactants’ structure were assessed by molecular orbital (MO) calculations of partial charges and frontier orbital electron densities, respectively. The photodegradation of DBS was faster than the MELs as also evidenced by surface tension measurements, whereas the photomineralization of the anionic DBS surfactant was definitely slower than that of the MEL biosurfactants due to the hydrophobic alkyl chain in the DBS structure. Possible initial mechanistic stages of the photooxidation of MEL-A and MEL-B are proposed based on experimental data and comparison with MO calculations.
