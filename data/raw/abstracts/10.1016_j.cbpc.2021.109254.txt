In this study, we aimed to assess the developmental toxicity and effects of 5-HMF in zebrafish as a model organism for toxicology studies. To this end, we treated zebrafish embryos with 1–100 μg/ml 5-HMF and observed bone staining, gene expression, and reactive oxygen species levels in order to investigate the toxicological effects of 5-HMF. The results showed that high concentrations of 5-HMF caused increased mortality and deformity rates in zebrafish larvae, inhibited cartilage development, reduced bone mineralization, increased reactive oxygen species levels, and disrupted the expression of genes related to bone development and reactive oxygen species enzyme activity. The antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine partially rescued the toxicological effects caused by the high concentrations of 5-HMF. Overall, these findings showed that high concentrations of 5-HMF induce reactive oxygen species production, leading to developmental toxicity and decreased bone mineralization. Our results provide a reference for understanding the toxic effects of 5-HMF.
