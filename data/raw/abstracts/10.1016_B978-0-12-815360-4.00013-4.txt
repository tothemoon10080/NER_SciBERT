Although the extrusion process has found numerous applications in developing ready-to-eat cereals, confectionary products, and sweet and salty snacks, interest has grown in understanding how extrusion influences the nutritional components in cereals and legumes. Extrusion offers the opportunity to manipulate the rate and extent of starch digestibility and nondigestible carbohydrate fermentation by gut bacteria, both of which have implications on human health. Proteins are generally modified in a positive way by increasing their digestibility and solubility, although some exceptions exist and losses in available lysine can occur. Extrusion can be used to deliver high-value oils that are rich in Ï‰-3 fatty acids using novel strategies such as encapsulation. Vitamin stability can be an issue in extruded products, although mineral element bioavailability can increase with extrusion. Overall, extrusion has the potential to produce highly nutritious ready-to-eat products from cereals and legumes.
