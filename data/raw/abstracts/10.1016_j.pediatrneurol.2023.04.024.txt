Mineralizing lenticulostriate vasculopathy is a well-recognized risk factor for basal ganglia stroke after minor head trauma in infants and young children; it is diagnosed on head computed tomography by the presence of basal ganglia calcification, seen as punctate hyperdensities on axial and linear hyperdensities on reconstructed coronal and sagittal images. In children with anterior fontanel window, its presence is suggested by branching hyperechogenic stripes in the basal ganglia region on cranial ultrasound. Brain magnetic resonance imaging, including susceptibility-weighted sequences and brain magnetic resonance angiography, fail to detect calcification or vascular abnormalities. Although its etiology remains unknown, mineralizing lenticulostriate vasculopathy is considered to represent end-stage pathology of lenticulostriate vasculopathy, a neonatal radiographic condition detected during routine neonatal cranial ultrasonographic examination and represents nonspecific finding associated with a multitude of etiologies. The significance of mineralizing lenticulostriate vasculopathy lies in the fact that it has emerged as one of the most common risk factors for basal ganglia stroke in Indian children, accounting for one-fourth to one-half of all causes of stroke in some studies. The outcome of stroke in children with mineralizing lenticulostriate vasculopathy appears to be favorable with the majority achieving complete or nearly complete recovery of their motor functions. Stroke recurrence following repeat head trauma is seen in a small proportion of children despite aspirin treatment.
