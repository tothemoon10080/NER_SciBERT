Recently, pulse ingredients with (partial) cellular intactness are put forward as promising innovative food ingredients with slowed macronutrient digestibility. This study compared cooking quality and nutrient (starch, protein, and mineral) digestibility/bioaccessibility of lentil-based pasta prepared from 100% raw-milled flour, and by substituting 30% of the formulation by isolated cotyledon cell powder or whole precooked powder. Formulation had little effect on cooking properties. Both amylolysis and proteolysis were significantly slowed by incorporating cellular ingredients: towards the end of simulated digestion, amylolysis was lowered by 16â€“25%, while differences in proteolysis became small. Cellular ingredient incorporation slightly decreased Zn and Mg but did not affect Ca and Fe bioaccessibility, overall yielding a low mineral bioaccessibility comparable to cooked whole pulses. To conclude, lentil-based pasta substituted with cellular ingredients showed improved nutritional properties (i.e., high in digestible protein and slowed amylolysis), with perspectives for the development of different innovative foods with targeted nutritional properties.
