Landsat 8 OLI images were processed using band ratio (RB), principal component analysis (PCA), composite ratios (CR) 4/2â€“6/7-6/5 were used to map lithology, geological structures, and hydrothermal alteration zones. The studied area, Jbel Boulachrhal, is characterized by copper, barite, and amethyst mineralization and is in the Maider basin at the level of Morocco's eastern Anti-Atlas, which is formed by Paleozoic landfills. This vein-type mineralization, which oriented NE-SW, NNE-SSW, to E-W corresponds to the main orientations of mapped faults using remote sensing and confirmed by the field study, and is revealed by the lineaments extracted from the processing of Landsat 8 Oli. The mineralization is polymetallic, with copper oxide and sulfide dominating, as well as quartz, amethyst, lead, and barite. Remote sensing techniques combined with field research have showed that high lineament density areas that frequently correlate with areas of hydrothermal alteration are highly related to the occurrences of these mineralizations. These findings indicate that satellite image processing techniques (lineament density and hydrothermal alteration zones) will most likely be used in mining exploration.
