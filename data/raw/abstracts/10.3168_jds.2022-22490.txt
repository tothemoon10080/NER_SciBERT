Trace mineral (TM) source can potentially alter nutrient digestibility through effects on microbial populations. A meta-analysis was conducted to determine whether sulfate versus hydroxy (IntelliBond) sources of supplemental Cu, Zn, and Mn had any effect on dry matter intake (DMI), dry matter digestibility, and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility. All available cattle studies (8 studies, 12 comparisons) were used to estimate the effect size (hydroxy mean − sulfate mean). Factors included in the analysis were method of digestibility analysis (total collection, marker-based, or 24 h in situ), study design (randomized design or Latin square), beef (n = 5) versus dairy (n = 7) cattle, and days on treatment; these factors were retained when P < 0.05. Dry matter digestibility was increased by hydroxy TM in beef (1.64 ± 0.35 units) but not in dairy models (0.16 ± 0.13 units) relative to sulfate TM. The NDF digestibility increased significantly with hydroxy versus sulfate TM, but digestibility assessment method influenced this response. Studies using total collection or undigested NDF as a flow marker showed a significant increase (2.68 ± 0.40 units and 1.08 ± 0.31 units, respectively) in NDF digestibility for hydroxy versus sulfate TM; but studies utilizing 24-h in situ incubation did not detect any change (−0.03 ± 0.23 units). These observations may reveal differences in precision of measurement or may indicate mineral effects beyond the rumen; total collection is considered the gold standard method. Hydroxy TM did not affect DMI per animal or per unit of body weight relative to sulfate TM. In conclusion, feeding hydroxy versus sulfate TM does not appear to affect DMI but, depending on type of cattle and method of measurement, can increase dry matter digestibility and NDF digestibility, which may be explained by differences in solubility of the TM sources in rumen, differentially affecting fermentation.
