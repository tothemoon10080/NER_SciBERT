To explore the applicability of flax retting liquid (FRL) addition, the physicochemical properties, microbial community structure and function, carbon conversion and humus (HS) formation were assessed during chicken manure (CM) aerobic composting. Compared with the control group, the addition of FRL increased the temperature at thermophilic phase, while the microbial mass carbon content (MBC) in SCF and FRH groups raised to 96.1 ± 0.25 g/Kg and 93.33 ± 0.27 g/Kg, respectively. Similarly, FRL also improved the concent of humic acid (HA) to 38.44 ± 0.85 g/Kg, 33.06 ± 0.8 g/Kg, respcetively. However, fulvic acid (FA) decreased to 30.02 ± 0.55 g/Kg, 31.4 ± 0.43 g/Kg, respectively and further reduced CO2 emissions. FRL influenced the relative abundance of Firmicutes at thermophilic phase and Ornithinimicrobium at maturity phase. Additionally, FRL strengthen the association among flora and reduce the number of bacteria, which was negative correlated with HA and positive with CO2 during composting. These findings offer powerful technological support for improving agricultural waste recycling.
