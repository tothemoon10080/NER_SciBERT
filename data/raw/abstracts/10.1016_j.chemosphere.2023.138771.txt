Spatial hydrological alterations seem to influence the variability of soil-bound magnetic particles and heavy metals in water reservoir riparian wetlands (RW). To date, applying geochemical analysis with magnetic techniques to assess heavy metal pollution is rarely practiced in RW soils. We studied the magnetic properties and heavy metals, including Cu, Cr, and Zn, of topsoils in RW and the adjacent upland regions (UR, as control) in the Three Gorges Reservoir, China. Potentially elevated low-frequency mass magnetic susceptibility (χLF), anhysteretic remanent magnetization susceptibility (χARM), isothermal remanent magnetism, and all selected heavy metals were found in RW. The grain size of the magnetic minerals was coarser in RW than that in UR. The pollution load index (PLI) of the studied samples was 1.18 ± 0.12 and 1.04 ± 0.21 in RW and UR, respectively. PLI and concentrations of Cu, Cr, and Zn were positively correlated with χLF, χARM, and isothermal remanent magnetism in RW, whereas no clear linkages were observed between PLI and isothermal remanent magnetism in UR. This finding reveals that hydrological alterations increased the magnetic enhancement and heavy metal enrichment in RW. We find that magnetic proxies of soils could trace the concentration of selected anthropogenic heavy metals and their pollution level in RW.
