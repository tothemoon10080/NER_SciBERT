Nanoparticles have been known to enhance the performance of refrigerating systems. In this work, the walnut shell was used as a reducing agent to synthesise copper oxide nanoparticles. The nanoparticle was mixed with mineral oil to investigate its effects on the refrigeration system and see if it ensured better performance than when using conventional mineral oil. The mixing ratio used for this project started with 250 ml of mineral oil to 0.50 g of the NP, while the concentration of the NP’s increased by 0.25 g as the samples progressed. The control sample of pure mineral oil was used to get a baseline for which the performance of each sample was based. Pull-down time and Net Refrigeration Effect (NRE) were used in determining the performance of all the samples and control. From the result, two samples, 0.75 g of NP and 1.25 g of NP, showed consistency in reducing the pull-down time and increasing the NRE compared to the control. A reduction in pull-down time by 8.98% and an increase in NRE by 9.3% was recorded for sample 0.75 g, while a reduction in the pull-down time by 9.51% and an increase in NRE by 19.05% was recorded for 1.25 g of NP.
