How to sustainably produce bauxite by effective reverse froth flotation of kaolinite at low temperature is an urgent problem to be solved in the field of mineral processing. In this work, a novel amino-based Gemini surfactant butadiyl-1, 4-bis (dimethyl dodecylammonium bromide) (BBDB) was prepared and first utilized as a novel collector for kaolinite flotation. Its flotation performance for kaolinite was compared with that of the common monomolecular surfactant 1-dodecylamine (DDA) by micro-flotation tests. The tests results indicated that 95% kaolinite recovery was obtained using 2.0 × 10−4 mol/L BBDB at 25 ℃, which was half of the dosage when DDA obtained the maximum kaolinite recovery of 81%. At extremely low temperature (0 ℃), 3.0 × 10−4 mol/L BBDB could still collect 91% kaolinite, while DDA showed a frustrating ability. The contact angle tests indicated that BBDB could still significantly improve the hydrophobicity of the kaolinite surface (contact angle 71.7°) than DDA (contact angle only 25.8°) at 0 ℃. The Krafft point comparison tests indicated that BBDB had a much lower Krafft point (below 0 ℃) than DDA. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)-spectrum analysis and zeta potential measurements showed that BBDB was physically adsorbed on the surface of kaolinite through electrostatic interaction.
