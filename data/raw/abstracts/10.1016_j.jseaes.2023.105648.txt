Our study region is located in the Cathaysia block (CB), Southeast China. The most significant feature of the CB is the widespread Mesozoic magmatism and poly-metallic mineralization. However, there is still no consensus on their genesis and related tectonic processes. In this study, we determine high-resolution (0.3° in the horizontal direction) tomographic images of Vp and Vs and Vp/Vs ratio in the crust and upper mantle using 6773 P-wave and 4526 S-wave travel-time data of teleseismic events recorded by a broadband linear seismic array. The array was deployed by our team in the middle part of the CB, consisting of 81 portable stations with an interval of 5–8 km. Our tomographic results reveal two obvious low-velocity (low-V) zones with high Vp/Vs ratio (high-σ) beneath the Nanling ore belt and the Wuyishan terrane, which may reflect magmatic channels formed by partial melting that may provide heat for metal mineralization. Two high-V anomalies with low-σ are located beneath the western Wuyishan terrane and the eastern CB, which may represent refractory lithosphere or remnants of delaminated lithospheric material caused by underplating of the magma due to the subduction of the paleo-Pacific plate and its following rollback. There exists an anomaly with low-Vp, high-Vs and low-σ at depths of 150–300 km beneath the western Wuyishan terrane, which may be related to the reserved trace of magmatic conduits. On the basis of the tomographic results, we propose a geodynamic model to explain the deep mechanism of mineralization beneath the CB.
