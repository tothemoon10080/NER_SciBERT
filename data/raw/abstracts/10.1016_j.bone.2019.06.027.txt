Mineralization of bone is a dynamic process, involving a complex interplay between cells, secreted macromolecules, signaling pathways, and enzymatic reactions; the dysregulation of bone mineralization may lead to serious skeletal disorders, including hypophosphatemic rickets, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Very few studies have reported the role of osteocytes — the most abundant bone cells in the skeletal system and the major orchestrators of bone remodeling in bone mineralization, which is owed to their nature of being deeply embedded in the mineralized bone matrix. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is actively involved in various life processes including osteogenesis; however, the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the terminal mineralization of bone, especially in the regulation of osteocytes, is largely unknown. This research demonstrates that during the terminal mineralization process, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is downregulated, and when Wnt/β-catenin signaling is activated in osteocytes, dendrite development is suppressed and the expression of dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) is inhibited. Aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in osteocytes leads to the spontaneous deposition of extra-large mineralized nodules on the surface of collagen fibrils. The altered mineral crystal structure and decreased bonding force between minerals and the organic matrix indicate the inferior integration of minerals and collagen. In conclusion, Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays a critical role in the terminal differentiation of osteocytes and as such, targeting Wnt/β-catenin signaling in osteocytes may serve as a potential therapeutic approach for the management of bone-related diseases.
