Long-term and continuous large-scale exploitation has increasingly exhausted shallow metal mineral resources, and deep mining has become inevitable. The current global status of deep mining of metal mineral resources was presented, a series of engineering challenges faced by deep mining were systematically analyzed, and some progress and future innovation focus in key engineering technologies, such as the prediction and prevention of rockburst, cooling techniques, rock support techniques, deep hoisting techniques, and several nontraditional deep mining techniques, were highlighted. Meanwhile, new insights into development strategies of deep mining technology were proposed. The integration of these forward-looking key innovative technologies will form the overall framework of an innovative technology system for the deep mining of metal minerals. This technology system will help to achieve safe, efficient, and green exploitation of deep underground metal mineral resources and ensure the sustainable development of the metal mining industry.
