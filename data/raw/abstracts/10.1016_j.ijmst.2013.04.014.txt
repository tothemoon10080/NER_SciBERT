Fetr6 is an underground mine in which chromite is extracted using stope and pillar mining method. Despite of all improving works such as roof supporting and replacing of ore pillars with concrete pillars, pillar No. 19 failed and other pillars failed progressively as a domino effect and 4000m2 of mine collapsed within a few minutes, consequently. For detail investigation, two 3-D numerical models were developed by 3Dec. The first, a base model, was used for estimation of stress on pillars just before failure and the other for investigation of rock burst in pillar No. 19. The results show that discontinuity parameters such as friction angle and shear stiffness is critical parameters in this pillar failure. In addition, it indicates that W/H ratio equal 0.3, the lack of ore extraction strategy and inadequate roof support are the major reasons for this failure. In this paper, the procedure of study was described.
