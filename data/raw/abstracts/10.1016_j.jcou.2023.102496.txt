Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) by mineralization has been shown to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions not only in stand-alone plants but also in large-scale climate-optimal supply chains. Yet, implementing the large-scale supply chain for CCUS by mineralization requires a substantial financial investment and, thus, a deep understanding of its economics. The current literature estimates the economics of CO2 mineralization for stand-alone plants. While CO2 mineralization plants have their specific a) CO2 supply, b) solid feedstock supply, c) energy supply, and d) product market, the plant-level cost estimation does not account for a large and potentially shared supply chain. In our study, we assess the economics of mineralization by designing and analyzing cost-optimal supply chains for CCUS by mineralization in Europe. Our results show that the CO2e abatement costs of individual mineralization plants in a supply chain range from 110 to 312 â‚¬/ton CO2e avoided. The proposed supply chains for CCUS by mineralization can avoid 60 Mt CO2e/year in Europe at CO2e abatement costs comparable to CO2 capture and geological storage. Furthermore, we identify five locations that could offer a robust business case for CO2 mineralization. The analysis thus shows pathways on how to add CO2 mineralization to the GHG mitigation portfolio of Europe.
