A possibility of the efficient use of rotary percussive drilling to provide drilling smaller diameter holes (40â€“70mm) both in mining and prospecting is disclosed herein. A new construction designed for the nipple thread connection is described. The relative amplitude variation, change of power pulse time and energy in their propagation throughout the drilling tool are determined. A possibility of the efficient power pulse transfer along the drill string to the rock destruction tools with new nipple connections which allow automating the make-up and breakout system of drill pipe was supported by experiments.
