Acid mine drainage (AMD) is low-pH with high concentration of sulfates and toxic metal(loid)s (e.g. As, Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn), thereby posing a global environmental problem. For decades, microalgae have been used to remediate metal(loid)s in AMD, as they have various adaptive mechanisms for tolerating extreme environmental stress. Their main phycoremediation mechanisms are biosorption, bioaccumulation, coupling with sulfate-reducing bacteria, alkalization, biotransformation, and Fe/Mn mineral formation. This review summarizes how microalgae cope with metal(loid) stress and their specific mechanisms of phycoremediation in AMD. Based on the universal physiological characteristics of microalgae and the properties of their secretions, several Fe/Mn mineralization mechanisms induced by photosynthesis, free radicals, microalgal-bacterial reciprocity, and algal organic matter are proposed. Notably, microalgae can also reduce Fe(III) and inhibit mineralization, which is environmentally unfavorable. Therefore, the comprehensive environmental effects of microalgal co-occurring and cyclical opposing processes must be carefully considered. Using chemical and biological perspectives, this review innovatively proposes several specific processes and mechanisms of Fe/Mn mineralization that are mediated by microalgae, providing a theoretical basis for the geochemistry of metal(loid)s and natural attenuation of pollutants in AMD.
