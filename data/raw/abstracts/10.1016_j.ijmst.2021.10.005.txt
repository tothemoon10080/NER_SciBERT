The parameters that influence slope stability and their criteria of failure are fairly understood but over-conservative design approaches are often preferred, which can result in excessive overburden removal that may jeopardize profitability in the context of open pit mining. Numerical methods such as finite element and discrete element modelling are instrumental to identify specific zones of stability, but they remain approximate and do not pinpoint the critical factors that influence stability without extensive parametric studies. A large number of degrees of freedom and input parameters may make the outcome of numerical modelling insufficient compared to analytical solutions. Existing analytical approaches have not tackled the stability of slopes using non-linear plasticity criteria and three-dimensional failure mechanisms. This paper bridges this gap by using the yield design theory and the Hoek-Brown criterion. Moreover, the proposed model includes the effect of seismic forces, which are not always taken into account in slope stability analyses. The results are presented in the form of rigorous mathematical expressions and stability charts involving the loading conditions and the rock mass properties emanating from the plasticity criterion.
