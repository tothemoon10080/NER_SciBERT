Mining companies are actively looking for new and innovative techniques which can significantly reduce operational costs and processing carbon footprint. The high voltage pulse (HVP) is a novel technology with the potential to be applied in the mineral processing industries which provides enhanced liberation, pre-weakening and pre-concentration benefits for raw material. This paper reviews in detail the HVP working principles and the work devoted to the aforementioned three applications. In addition, major challenges affecting the industrial uptake of the HVP technique are also discussed in the context of HVP fragmentation specific energy consumption, machine wear, cost of water processing and machine throughput limitations. HVP selectivity in between particles is accentuated in this review and believed to have good prospects for industrial uptake due to its capability to achieve selective fragmentation and selective weakening effects for the mineralised particles. Finally, the paper is enclosed with an outlook of HVP future development.
