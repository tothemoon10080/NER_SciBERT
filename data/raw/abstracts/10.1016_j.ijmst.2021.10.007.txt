In this paper, two surfactants, 3-dodecyloxypropanamine (DOPA) and 3-tetradecyloxypropylamine (TOPA), were synthesized and used as collectors in the quartz micro-flotation in the laboratory. Micro-flotation tests, FT-IR, XPS measurements, and ab initio Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to research DOPA, TOPA, and dodecylamine (DDA)'s adsorption mechanisms onto quartz (101) surfaces. The results of micro-flotation show that the adsorption of DOPA and TOPA onto quartz surface is more robust than that of DDA. The zeta-potential result shows that the DOPA/TOPA was adsorbed on quartz through electrostatic attraction. Then, MD simulation adsorption models were built to compare the computational properties of the three surfactants, such as the radial distribution function, and the interaction energies between the collectors and the quartz cleavage surface. The interaction energies of surfactants (RNH3
                     + or RNH2) on the quartz surface explained why the pH range of DOPA/TOPA is wider than that of DDA. XPS analyses and MD simulations confirmed that DOPA bonded with the (101) surface of quartz through three types of hydrogen bonds between the NH2 of DOPA and the O atom of quartz. The hydrogen bonds of type A and type C were the most likely type and more potent than those of type B.
