The effects of pasteurization, sterilization and, drying of milk on the contents of Cu, Fe, Zn, Mn, Ca, Mg, Na, and K at different stages of these processes were studied. Determinations were made by atomic-absorption spectrophotometry with flame and emission. The existence of statistically significant differences (p < 0.001) for Cu and Fe is observed with a tendency to decrease slightly during pasteurization and sterilization. In the drying process, statistically significant differences were observed (p < 0.001) for all the elements. By a ScheffÃ© multiple-range analysis, the formation of a single homogeneous group composed of raw and homogenized milk was observed for all the mineral elements. For Fe, Ca, Na, and K, two homogeneous groups were formed, one of concentrated skimmed milk and the other of powdered milk. The relationships between the mineral elements investigated in the different processes were studied by multivariate-factor analysis.
