Electrochemical degradation of toxic sulfanilamide with inexpensive approach is in urgent demand due to the harmful effects of sulfanilamide for both humans and aquatic environments. Here, we reported an efficient mineralization of sulfanilamide by using NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanosheets array with abundant oxygen vacancies that was in situ grown on exfoliated graphene (EG) by a simple hydrothermal treatment at different temperatures. The hydrothermal temperature was carefully analyzed for control synthesis of oxygen vacancy-rich NiFe-LDH/EG nanosheets array (NiFe-LDH/EG-OVr) for sulfanilamide degradation. Owing to the abundant oxygen vacancies, NiFe-LDH/EG-OVr rapidly generated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radical (•OH) during electro-Fenton (EF) process, which resulted in the 98% mineralization of sulfanilamide in first 80 min. The radicals trapping experiments revealed that the •OH radicals was participated as the main active oxidation species in the efficient mineralization of sulfanilamide. The present results indicated that the oxidative attack by •OH radicals initiated the degradation process of sulfanilamide. During the total degradation of sulfanilamide, several organic compounds including aminophenol, hydroquinone, and oxalic acid, were identified as main intermediates by using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (HPLC-MS).
