Lumbar bone mineral concentration, as predicted by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), may reflect changes in lamb maturity and eating quality. New season (n = 60) and old season (n = 60) lambs were slaughtered and DEXA scanned at a commercial abattoir across 2 kill groups. The second lumbar vertebra was isolated from the spine for determination of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium concentration (mg/g). The loin and rack cuts were collected for consumer sensory grilling and roasting analyses. Mineral concentration was significantly higher in old season lambs within kill group 1 (P < 0.05). DEXA was a positive predictor of phosphorus and calcium concentration, but only when DEXA lean % (P < 0.05) was included in the model. Calcium and phosphorus were significant positive predictors of overall liking scores (P < 0.05), but only for the rack roast. These effects became insignificant when DEXA lean % was included. These results suggest that DEXA values likely reflect changes in both DEXA lean % and bone minerals, and that DEXA lean % was the driver of eating quality, rather than maturity.
