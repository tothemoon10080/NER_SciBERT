With the deepening understanding for the concept of sustainable development, the utilization of minerals is no longer limited to the traditional way. In this study, an environment friendly method for preparing Fe–Al2O3 composites by using natural minerals was investigated. Additionally, the effects of CeO2 on the properties of composites were studied. The mechanical properties of Fe–Al2O3 composites prepared by natural minerals are affected by the brittleness of glass phase. The strength and toughness of the glass phase in the composite are improved successfully by using rare earth oxides, indicating that the natural rare earths in Bayan Obo minerals have an enhanced influence on the properties of composite materials. The results show that the properties of glass phase can be significantly improved by addition of CeO2. At the optimal addition of 3 wt% CeO2, the composite achieves the density of 4.21 g/cm3, flexural strength of 401 MPa, Vickers hardness of 13.07 GPa and fracture toughness of 6.58 MPa⋅m1/2. The composite has excellent mechanical properties, which can be used in engineering as a cheap structural material. This study aims at reducing waste emissions, improving energy efficiencies and avoiding waste of rare earth resources during the preparation of composite materials.
