The deposited dust provides a large surface for heterogeneous ozone uptake reactions in urban regions. Prior studies have barely considered the effect of the photothermal conversion of deposited dust and underlying surface on ozone uptake. In this study, Fe2O3, TiO2, α-Al2O3, and SiO2 were selected as model mineral dusts (MDs) to evaluate the photothermal effect. With an irradiation intensity of 100 mW/cm2, the uptake coefficients of ozone by Fe2O3, TiO2, α-Al2O3, and SiO2 were 2.4, 30, 2.72, and 2.83 times higher than those in a dark condition. For SiO2 and α-Al2O3, the increase in the uptake coefficient was due to the temperature increase induced by photothermal conversion. For Fe2O3 and TiO2, photoelectric and photothermal conversion simultaneously participated in ozone uptake reactions. At 70 °C, the contribution of thermal catalysis to ozone uptake over Fe2O3 and TiO2 was approximately 55.4 % and 55.0 %, respectively. The temperature increase induced by photothermal conversion also promoted MDs' activity for ozone uptake after removing the light source (after sunset). This work proves that the ozone uptake induced by the photothermal effect of deposited MDs and the underlying surface was the primary ozone elimination pathway in urban atmospheres.
