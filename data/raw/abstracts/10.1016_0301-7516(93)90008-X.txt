A new process to concentrate fine and ultrafine mineral particles from aqueous suspensions is reported. This process is based on the attachment of mineral particles to the surface of polymeric carrier particles via hydrophobic interactions. The carrier used here was polypropylene treated with oleic acid and studies were conducted with various mineral fines model systems. Polypropylene particles coated with mineral particles can be separated from the pulp either by screening, settling or by flotation resulting from their relative densities. Flotation takes place when mineral particles are “carried” up to the air/pulp interface as aggregates with densities less than unity (levitation). Detachment of carried mineral particles was performed by stirring in alkaline suspensions. This introductory article reports basic features, main operating parameters and examines some practical examples of the process at bench scale.
