Misreported pyrite into copper concentrates dramatically declines copper grade and recovery. Copper flotation can be also more complicated if flotation feed comes from an elevated-pyritic copper ore. In this investigation, the effect of two different ore types (high pyritic and low pyritic feeds) was studied on rougher stage of industrial copper flotation circuit. Samples were taken from different streams and the structure of chalcopyrite within the pyrite and non-sulfide gangue minerals was examined in various size fractions for mentioned ore types. Results indicated that 72% and 56% of the total floated pyrite was transferred to concentrate in first four cells in the low and high pyritic feeds, respectively. Whereas, this proportion for floated SiO2 in last ten cells was detected as 72% and 71%, respectively. A detailed interpretation of the effect of locked particles in different size fractions on rougher flotation cells is studied from industrial point of view.
