A proton microprobe in combination with proton induced X-ray emission and a X-ray microprobe are used in the study of the mineralization process. It is demonstrated that the application of both methods enables the determination of the crystallographic structure of the inorganic phase in biological samples with a spatial resolution of about 20 Î¼m.
