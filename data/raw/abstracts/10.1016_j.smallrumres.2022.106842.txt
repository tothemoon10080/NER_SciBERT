This study aimed to evaluate the nutritional quality of goat whey considering the impacts of raising system. Goat whey from Coalho cheese processing was assessed for the minerals, organic acid and fatty acid profiles, amino acid composition, and protein pattern. The pasture production system resulted in products with a better mineral composition (higher concentration of calcium, iron, and potassium and lower sodium concentration) and improved fatty acid profile (lower proportions of medium-chain fatty acids, higher concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids, lower n6-n3 ratio, and better health indices). Furthermore, a greater intensity of protein bands and proteins of higher molecular weight was observed. On the other hand, the confinement production system resulted in higher concentrations of essential amino acids, glutamic and aspartic acids, alanine, and proline. The results demonstrated that goat whey has a high nutritional value and potential as an ingredient to the food industry, regardless of the raising system.
