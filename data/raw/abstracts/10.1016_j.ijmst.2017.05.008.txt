Complex industrial systems, including mining, have a prominent challenge in understanding the interrelationship among the cognitive processes, working environment and available equipment. The concept of cognitive work analysis (CWA) transcends the traditional analytic methods of evaluating human tasks solely based on perceptual and physical traits, and rather implements the notions of behavioral and cognitive awareness indispensable for the intricacy of modern technology. In the last few decades, academic and industrial settings employ this type of analysis to set a suitable standard for a systemâ€™s safety feasibility, and as a result reduce human-based errors. This research paper analyzes current CWA methods and proposes a five-level quantification model portraying the overall cognitive quality of a mining operation.
