South China is characterized by enormous volumes of igneous rocks generated by multiple stages of magmatism. Five large-scale metallogenic belts with many world-class deposits have been discovered, demonstrating great potential for prospecting new resources. To restrict the South China metallogenic cognition the main problems include the types and metal associations of the deposits, factors controlling the distribution of the different types of metallogenic belts, and targets for new deposits. To find possible and feasible solutions to solve these problems. It is necessary to consider the metallogenic factors from the concept of mineral systems. This study first converted the satellite gravity into Bouguer gravity under spherical coordinates. Then the reduction-to-the pole (RTP) magnetic anomalies were obtained using a moving window with different geomagnetic parameters. The vertical lithospheric interfaces and main faults were inverted and interpreted according to these gravity and magnetic data. Based on the results obtained, we have discussed the possible sources and pathways of the five metallogenic belts in South China. Meanwhile, it identified the 3D spatial distribution of intrusions qualitatively by inverted susceptibility and density model, and predicted the potential sites for Cu, Fe, Au, W, and Sn deposits.
