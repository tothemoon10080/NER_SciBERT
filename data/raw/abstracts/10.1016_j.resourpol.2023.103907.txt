Mineral resources are essential to our everyday lives but are finite and can be depleted if not managed responsibly. Unfortunately, many natural resources have been exploited and depleted due to unsustainable mining practices and over-consumption. This has led to environmental degradation in many parts of the world, with deforestation, air and water pollution, and soil erosion as expected consequences. This paper explores the impacts of mineral resource depletion and environmental degradation on natural resource uses in China from 1971 to 2018, considering the impact of general government final consumption expenditure from the perspective of COVID-19 aftereffects. Mineral resource depletion is negatively associated with natural resource rents in China. Environmental degradation and economic growth increase natural resource rents, depicting that as resources become scarcer, the rents associated with natural resources also increase. Governments must ensure that regulations are in place to protect the environment, invest in renewable energy sources, and support businesses transitioning from resource-intensive production. These policies will help ensure the environment is protected and resources are used responsibly and sustainably. Research limitations and future directions are discussed.
