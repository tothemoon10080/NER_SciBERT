Microbial-mediated redox reactions typically control the solute mobilization in groundwater systems, in which the clay aquitard is usually a triggering factor of the release of the dissolved organic carbon, ammonium, and iron into the aquifer during pore water discharge and clay compaction. However, solute mobilization inside the aquitard during clay compaction is generally mistaken for a similar waterâ€“rock interaction process in aquifers controlled by microbial-mediated redox reactions. Through a simulation experiment on argillaceous sediment compaction, we tested the currently accepted solute mobilization mechanism and determined that the variation in the mineral structure dominates it. The variation in the mineral structure occurs in low symmetry minerals, such as clay minerals, and is controlled by the sediment moisture content, the liquid-plastic limit, and the effective stress. When the sediment moisture content decreases to below the plastic limit through pore water discharge and compaction, sudden changes in the mineral structure occur, releasing iron and capturing ammonium through variations in the relative position of the Si-O tetrahedrons and isomorphism of similar atoms without the participation of microbial-mediated redox reactions. These results suggest that the biochemical reactivities of organic carbon, iron, and ammonium are sometimes overestimated, i.e., when the role of the physical processes is ignored, in solute mobilization during clay compaction, which warrants more attention and investigation.
