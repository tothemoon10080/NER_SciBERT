A possibly prominent role for Green Rust minerals in life's emergence is inferred from a comparison of their structural, mechano-dynamic and electrochemical properties and of the layout of bioenergetic, i.e. free energy converting processes in extant organisms. From fundamental thermodynamic considerations, the conversion of environmental free energy into the decrease of entropy that defines life is an indispensable ingredient for life to emerge. A specific scenario for life's emergence mediated by Green Rust minerals in the framework of the alkaline hydrothermal vent hypothesis is proposed.
