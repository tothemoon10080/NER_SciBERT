Using the large-scale thick 4# coal seam from the Mid-Jurassic in the southern Ordos Basin as an example, this paper studied the net primary productivity (NPP) level of the Mid-Jurassic peatland, and discussed its control factors. Geophysical logging signals were used for a spectrum analysis to obtain the Milankovitch cycle parameters in coal seam. These were then used to calculate the accumulation rate of the residual carbon in 4# coal seam. The carbon loss can be calculated according to the density and residual carbon content of 4# coal seam. Then, the total carbon accumulation rate of the peatland was further derived, and the NPP of peatland was determined. The results show that the NPP of Mid-Jurassic peatland is higher than that of Holocene at the same latitude. Comprehensive analysis indicates that the temperature, carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in atmosphere are the main control factors of the NPP of Mid-Jurassic peatland.
