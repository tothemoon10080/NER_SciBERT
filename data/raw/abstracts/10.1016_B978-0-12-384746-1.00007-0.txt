Magnetic separation, as a powerful technique for the manipulation of magnetic particles, has attracted worldwide attentions and achieved tremendous applications in the past several decades, due to its effectiveness, simple operation, low cost, and environmental sustainability. In the field of mineral processing, magnetic separation is mainly used for concentration of magnetic components and for removal of magnetic impurities, under dry or wet conditions. Basic theoretical principle of magnetic separations and three types of magnetic separators, i.e., low-intensity, high-intensity, and high-gradient magnetic separators, and their technological innovations and operational practices are reviewed. In particular, pulsating high-gradient magnetic separation, a landmark progress in the treatment of fine weakly magnetic minerals such as iron oxide ores and ilmenite, and its continual developments and operational variables are expatiated. Practical cases in the processing of typically magnetic ores, i.e., magnetite, hematite, limonite, ilmenite and nonmetallic ores where magnetic techniques are well embodied, are introduced. At the end of this chapter, the merits and limitations of current magnetic techniques and the future trends in the research and development of potential magnetic techniques are discussed.
