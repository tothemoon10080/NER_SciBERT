Mineral carbonation of construction and demolition waste is a viable alternative for the reduction of CO2 emissions from industry. Concrete and cement, together with ceramic blocks, are the primary sources of calcium for mineral carbonation in which CO2 is fixed in a stable and inert process. One type of concrete was selected from 5 for the carbonation tests. Crushed, separated into size fractions, moistened to 20% and tested at 10 bars of CO2 for 24 to 720h. Destruction of portlandite and ettringite phases was determined. Calcite precipitated as carbonate phase. Maximum carbonation was reached after 72h, fixing 6.5% of CO2.
