The prospective use of processes of electric impulse (EI) disintegration of materials in order to study mineral structure for beneficiation of ores, for the processing of mineral raw material, and for the processes of industrial-waste utilization are examined. The principles of EI-destruction have been briefly depicted, and a specific feature of multi-component material disintegration has been explained (a strongly expressed, selective character of destruction). This ensures a high degree of disclosure of useful mineral grains in the process of disintegration and an essential increase in extraction and in improving the quality of concentrates at the next stage of ore beneficiation.
                  The features and technological efficiency of EI-disintegration of various types of ores, and the spheres of effective use of the method have been determined. In particular, a part from minimizing damage, a high degree of mineral grain disclosure provides a highly effective method for implementing extraction of jewels and mica crystals for the process of artificial mica processing. The possibility of using EI-disintegration in special purposes, such as in deriving pure mono-mineral factions of a product for geological investigations of mineral raw material, has been shown. Possibilities have been shown for using EI-technology to resolve different ecological problems, while increasing use of integrated raw mineral and industrial waste.
