This chapter will focus on spectral features of hydrothermal alteration minerals and lithologies in the visible and near-infrared, shortwave infrared, and thermal infrared wavelength regions. The technical characteristics of multispectral and hyperspectral sensors, synthetic aperture radar, and unmanned aerial vehicles will be deciphered for detecting the alteration minerals and zones, lithological units, and structural features associated with ore mineralizations. Explanations about data acquisition for the remote sensing data, preprocessing techniques, image-processing algorithms, accuracy assessment techniques, interpretation of remote sensing data for alteration mineral detection, lithological mapping, structural analysis, and case studies will be discussed in this chapter.
