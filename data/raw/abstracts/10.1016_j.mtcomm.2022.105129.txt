In this paper, a natural pozzolan with suitable physical and chemical properties was introduced to replace a part of cement of concrete, followed by investigating its engineering properties. The mechanical properties of pozzolanic concrete must be improved for its applicability and adaption to the industry. Therefore, steel and polypropylene fibers are used separately and hybrid with the new mineral pozzolan in concrete. According to the previous investigation and optimization, mineral pozzolan with a weight fraction of 15% replacement of cement was employed in concrete. Finally, the strength rate of local mineral pozzolan specimens was compared with that of other pozzolanic concretes, and the effect of this concrete mixture parameter on CO2 emissions was evaluated as well. The results showed that pozzolanic concrete containing steel fibers has more compressive strength compared to other specimens. Pozzolanic concrete specimens consisting of a combination of steel and polypropylene fibers had better performance in terms of flexural strength in comparison with other specimens. The growth rate of the compressive strength of these pozzolan specimens was higher than that of silica fume and fly ash in age of 7–21 days of curing. It also had 15.5% less CO2 pollution with higher strength compared to plain cement concrete. Therefore, this pozzolan can be a great alternative to the partial replacement of cement in concrete and reduction of cement consumption to a good extent, which is a valuable finding for environmental protection and green concrete production.
