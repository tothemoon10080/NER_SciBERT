The concept of mineral assemblages is fundamental to the study of rocks, and this article portrays the evolution of thought and methods over the past 100 years. In metamorphic rocks, the locally coexisting minerals often reflect near-equilibrium states that were established at conditions of elevated pressure (P) and temperature (T). Most minerals are solid solutions, and fluids participating in metamorphic reactions have variable composition as well. For this reason, detailed analysis of the compositions of minerals and the textures preserved in metamorphic samples are essential, if one wants to understand metamorphism. Consideration of these characteristics typically indicates several stages of a protracted metamorphic evolutionâ€”a sequence of P-T stages. These are often only partially preserved, and different methods are required to unravel to what extent coexisting minerals may or may not represent local (near-) equilibrium states. State-of-the-art thermodynamic modelling used in combination with compositional mapping can lead to a fairly detailed understanding of the processes and a robust quantification of the P-T conditions of individual metamorphic stages. Challenges for these approaches include the proper identification of the effective bulk composition of a sample (or of homogeneous local domains), as well as consideration of kinetic limits to equilibration.
