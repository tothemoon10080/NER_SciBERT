Titanium (Ti) has good mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility. Biomaterials for the oral cavity have special requirements, such as the ability to resist bacterial adhesion and promote mineralization. Therefore, the modified Ti surface must have good antibacterial adhesion properties and mineralization activity. The material surface with zwitteric ionic polymer modification has a strong hydration and steric resistance effect, providing excellent bacteria resistance. In our previous work, zwitterionic poly[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl choline phosphate] (Ti-PMCP) was used to modify Ti surface via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization, which can promote cell adhesion and prevent nonspecific protein adsorption. In this work, we further studied the antibacterial and mineralization properties of Ti-PMCP and its the application potential in oral implant materials.
