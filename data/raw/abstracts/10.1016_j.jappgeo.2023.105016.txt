The iron oxide‑gold‑copper deposit (IOCG) and hydrothermal nickel deposit are globally important targets for mineral exploration due to their notable role in the clean energy transition. The Carajás Mineral Province stands out for having the highest known concentration of world-class IOCG deposits, especially within the regional Canaã shear system, which exerts a critical control in polymetallic deposit distribution. The dense regolith cover and rainforest vegetation hinder the structural mapping and recognition of host rocks and metasomatic facies. In this context, we integrated remote sensing and geological data to evaluate the influence of the structural framework on the IOCG and hydrothermal nickel mineralization location and the metasomatic footprints that envelope these mineral deposits. These deposits are spatially correlated to anomalies that have values greater than the average and standard deviation (⩾ x̄ + s

                     ) of the gamma-spectrometry and geomorphological features (K/eTh, eU/eTh, F-parameter, K and eU deviations, and morpholineament density). The regional control is exerted by NW–SE- and N–S-trending structures, whereas NE–SW- and E–W-oriented shallow structures present the most significant mineralization control at the local scale. Structure intersections express the Carajás deep to the shallow crustal architecture of the region and the potential pathways for the hydrothermal and ore-forming fluids in multiple metallogenetic events.
