Clay minerals have great potentials in pinpointing sediment provenance for large depositional systems. However, source identification using clay minerals for small floodplain lakes is not well known. Situated in the North China Plain, the Dongping Lake receives sediments from both the Yellow River and the Dawen River, thereby representing an ideal site for testing the utility of this method. Here we use clay minerals in conjunction with the Bayesian end-member modeling analysis (BEMMA) to quantify the riverine contribution to modern sediments in the Dongping Lake. Results showed that modern sediments of the Dongping Lake are characterized by four primary clay minerals: illite, smectite, kaolinite, and chlorite, with average contents of 60.53%, 11.37%, 12.70%, and 15.40%, respectively. Clay minerals in modern sediments of the Dongping Lake are mainly delivered by the Yellow River, accounting for approximately 58.99–72.33%; whereas those originating from the Dawen River only account for 27.67–41.01%. It is also found that clay mineral from these rivers have a marked spatial variability. For example, source materials from the Yellow River are widely distributed across the lake, while those from the Dawen River only occur at the estuary of the river and slightly spread out in all directions under the action of water flow.
