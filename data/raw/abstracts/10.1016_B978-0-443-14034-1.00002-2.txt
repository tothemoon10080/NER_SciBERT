Minerals (primary and secondary) represent the major part of the solid phase of the soil. Secondary minerals, which are mostly present in the soil clay fraction, present reactive surfaces at which chemical reactions take place. The charge properties of soil clay minerals are responsible for surface chemical reactions. This chapter discusses the chemical composition of soils and the nature of chemical bonds in minerals. Elemental coordination is described via Paulingâ€™s rules. The major types of silicate mineral classes are described along with mineral weathering pathways and products. Special attention is given to phyllosilicate mineral structures and calculation of charge, such as in the 2:1 and 1:1 phyllosilicates. The description and properties of important metal oxides are presented. A background and procedures used for X-ray diffraction (XRD) identification of minerals are given. Surface area and points of zero charge are also described in the chapter.
