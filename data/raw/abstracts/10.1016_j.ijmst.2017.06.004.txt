On the basis of understanding the principle of rotary triboelectrostatic separation, dynamic analysis of charged fly ash particles aimed at determining the key factors and separation experiments to improve decarbonization efficiency had been carried out. Variables of electrode plate voltage and corrected wind speed are the key factors which affect the decarbonization efficiency on the separation of fly ash. The results of separation experiments show that: (1) With the plate voltage increasing, the efficiency of decarbonization continuously rises and in its selected range, the optimal voltage level is 45kV; (2) The corrected wind speed can impact the efficiency of decarbonization significantly: with the speed increasing, the efficiency of decarbonization shows a trend of first decline, then increase and decrease again, and in its selected range, the optimal speed is 2.0m/s. This study is of significance for the improvement of rotary triboelectrostatic separation performance and its decarbonization separation efficiency.
