Obtaining high removal rate of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) and CO2 selectivity with a low ratio of O3/CVOC and energy consumption is challenging. Dodecylamine was used in this study to create active sites on Co3O4 for photo-ozone catalytic mineralization of dichloromethane (DCM). Amine-Co3O4-450 is a dodecylamine-modified sample with high density of Co3+, Co2+, and hydroxyl due to its nanosheet structure and exposed (112) facets. The optimized surface significantly enhanced the cleavage of the Câ€“Cl bond at low temperatures. Photocatalysis primarily participated in the oxidation of intermediates following DCM dichlorination and significantly improved CO2 selectivity. The respective DCM removal rate and mineralization efficiency of Amine-Co3O4-450 with an O3/DCM molar ratio of 1.27 and one-sun irradiation were 14.9 and 15.0 times higher than the sum of those in the presence of light irradiation or O3 alone. This finding indicated that a strong synergistic effect exists between O3 and light.
