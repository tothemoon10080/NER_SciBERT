Mineral particles in air could provide atmospheric chemical reaction interface for gaseous substances and participate in atmospheric chemical reaction process, and affecting the status and levels of gaseous pollutants in air. However, differences of the heterogenous reaction on the surface minerals particles are not very clear. Considering main mineral composition of ambient particles was from dust emission, therefore, typical clay minerals (chlorite, illite) and desert particles (Taklimakan Desert) were selected to analysize chemical reaction of NO2, one of major gaseous pollutants, on mineral particles by using of In-situ DRIFTS (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy) under different condition. And In situ near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (In situ NAP-XPS) was employed to investigate iron (one of the major metals) species variation on the surface of mineral dust particles during the heterogeneous reactions. Our data show that humidity controlled by deuterium oxide (D2O) has a greater effect on chemical reactions compared to light and temperature. Under dry conditions, the amount of heterogeneous reaction products of NO2 on the particles shows Xiaotang dust > chlorite > illite > Tazhong dust regardless of dark or light conditions. In contrast, under humidity conditions, the order of nitrate product quantity under moderate conditions was chlorite > illite > Xiaotang dust > Tazhong dust. In situ NAP-XPS results demonstrate that specie variation of the Fe could promote the heterogenous reactions. These data could provide useful information for understanding the formation mechanism of nitrate aerosols and removal of nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere.
