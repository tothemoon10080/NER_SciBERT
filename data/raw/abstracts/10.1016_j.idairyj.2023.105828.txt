Calcium plays a significant role in stability, functional and nutritional properties of milk. Calcium was depleted by 25, 47 and 66% using cation exchange resin and increased by 10, 20 and 31% in the form of CaCl2Ã—H2O in buffalo milk. Heat stability increased on 25% calcium depletion; however, calcium addition resulted in a progressive decrease with concentration. Calcium depletion resulted insignificant increase of pH and decrease in buffering capacity of milk. However, pH decreased and buffering capacity increased on calcium addition. Furthermore, alteration in calcium affects minerals distribution in milk. A significant decrease in calcium and potassium along with an increase in sodium were observed on calcium depletion in total and soluble phase of milk. Phosphorus was found to decrease in soluble phase of calcium added milk. The results obtained will contribute towards a better understanding of functionality of buffalo milk during processing of buffalo-based products with altered calcium content.
