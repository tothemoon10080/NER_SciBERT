The screening of particles with different vibration modes was simulated by means of a 3D discrete element method (3D-DEM). The motion and penetration of the particles on the screen deck were analyzed for linear, circular and elliptical vibration of the screen. The results show that the travel velocity of the particles is the fastest, but the screening efficiency is the lowest, for the linear vibration mode. The circular motion resulted in the highest screening efficiency, but the lowest particle travel velocity. In the steady state the screening efficiency for each mode is seen to increase gradually along the longitudinal direction of the deck. The screening efficiency increment of the circular mode is the largest while the linear mode shows the smallest increment. The volume fraction of near-mesh size particles at the underside is larger than that of small size particles all along the screen deck. Linear screening mode has more near-mesh and small size particles on the first three deck sections, and fewer on the last two sections, compared to the circular or elliptical modes.
