Though thallium (Tl) is usually present in trace amounts in natural environments, its biotoxicity is extremely high. With the development of mining, the metallurgy industry, and the growing application of Tl in high-tech fields, the threat of Tl to ecological environments and human health is increasing. Natural minerals, such as clay minerals, iron oxides, and manganese oxides, are natural Tl adsorbents due to their mineralogy and crystal structures. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of Tl adsorption by various natural minerals, compare the adsorption capacities of common soil minerals for Tl, and describe the limitations of traditional sequential extraction methods for identifying the chemical states of Tl on minerals and source of Tl. We also provide suggestions on future directions needed in Tl research including a) additional in-depth studies on the competitive adsorption of Tl by minerals; b) more direct comparison of Tl adsorption behavior from lab-based experiments with field observations to clarify the mechanisms of Tl adsorption by minerals under environmental conditions; c) more research data are needed to support the establishment and improvement of relevant research methods based on modern leading-edge technologies such as synchrotron radiation. Further, we suggest further research is needed in adsorption technologies used for Tl treatment. This is the first review on the research progress of Tl adsorption by natural minerals with the purpose of helping understanding the mechanisms of Tl migration and transformation controlled by natural minerals, and providing theoretical supports for the development of Tl adsorbents and the treatments of Tl pollution.
