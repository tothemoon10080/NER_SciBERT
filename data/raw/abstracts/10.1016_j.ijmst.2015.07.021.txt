In this paper an attempt is made to recover sillimanite by flotation tree analysis process and conventional flotation process from non magnetic fraction of red sediments. The experimental results of both the processes are presented. The data reveal that the deslimed sample contains 33.2% (by weight) total heavy minerals and out of which the sillimanite mineral content is 3.6% (by weight). It is observed that flotation tree analysis needs 10 cells to get five output products and where as conventional flotation process needs 15 cells to recover similar grade of five output products. Thus, flotation tree analysis is not only economic process but also efficient process (to say efficient process, the tree analysis product should be higher grade).
