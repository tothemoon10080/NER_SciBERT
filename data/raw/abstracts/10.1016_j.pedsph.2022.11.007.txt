The combination of organic carbon (OC) and reactive minerals is a crucial mechanism of soil C storage, which is regulated by the formation of organic-mineral complexes on the surface of soil colloids. The effect of organic fertilizer on the storage mechanism of OC in soil colloids was studied through an 8-year field experiment, which included 4 treatments: (i) CK, no fertilization, (ii) NPK, only mineral fertilization, (iii) NPKC1, and (iv) NPKC2, mineral fertilizer with low and high level organic fertilization, respectively. The main results indicated that organic fertilizer addition significantly increased the content of aromatic C, in which it was 158.7% and 140.0% higher in soil colloids than that in bulk soil in NPKC1 and NPKC2 treatments, respectively. And X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy further demonstrated that, compared with CK treatment, the relative proportion of C=C on the surface of soil colloids were increased by 20.1% and 19.1% in NPKC1 and NPKC2 treatments, respectively. Meanwhile, compared with NPK treatment, the content of reactive minerals (such as Fe and Al oxides) was significantly increased with organic fertilization, which were positively correlated with C=C in soil colloids. This indicated that aromatic C might be retained by forming aromatic-mineral complexes with reactive minerals in soil colloids. Besides that, organic fertilization significantly increased OC storage efficiency (OCSE), in which it was significantly higher in NPKC1 treatment than that in NPKC2 treatment. Therefore, moderate amount of organic fertilizer application was a better agronomic practice to increase OCSE and OC storage in saline-alkaline paddy soil.
