Coal gangue is a waste derived from coal mining, and its unreasonable disposal usually causes serious land occupation and environmental pollution. Using coal gangue as a substitute for natural aggregate is an effective recycling approach, however, the high water absorption and high crushing rate of coal gangue seriously weaken its performance. This study proposed a novel strategy to decrease the water absorption and crushing rate of coal gangue by co-calcining with mineral powders, including K-feldspar, wollastonite, blast furnace slag and fly ash, meanwhile clarified the improvement mechanisms. Results showed that after calcining with mineral powders, the crushing rate of coal gangue decreased from 16.8 % to 16.1–13.2 %, and water absorption decreased from 5.29 % to 2.74–3.90 %, among which the coal gangue treated by K-feldspar and blast furnace slag had the lowest water absorption (2.74 %), reducing by 48.2 % compared to raw coal gangue. Underlying mechanisms were that during calcination, mineral powders generated micro-crystalline glaze on gangue surface, which improved the pore size distribution of coal gangue and strengthened its hardness. Specifically, as for pores with 1–1000 nm diameter, the pore volume percentage decreased from 88.5 % to 43.2–71.3 %. Vickers hardness of coal gangue increased from 0.29 GPa to 6.37–6.79 GPa, and the fracture toughness increased significantly to 41.9–67.6 MPa m1/2. Under K-feldspar and blast furnace slag treatment, the approximate thickness of micro-crystalline glaze was about 32 μm. The main component of micro-crystalline glaze was silicate lattice derived from SiO2 and Al2O3, and abundant Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 crystalline were sealed in the glaze. This study provides an innovative approach to strengthen the performance of coal gangue, which is important to expand the resource utilization of coal gangue and control the environmental pollution.
