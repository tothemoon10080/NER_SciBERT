Abstract
                  Biofilms can interact with minerals, by either dissolving the substrates on which they are attached and/or inducing mineral precipitation within their extracellular matrix. Diverse scientific fields have studied such mineral-biofilm interactions as they have numerous and broad implications, including the aging and conservation of monument stones, the formation of caries, a control on soil fertility, the geological CO2 cycle and water quality. Despite the importance of mineral-biofilms interactions, they remain difficult to investigate since this task requires biological, crystallographic and chemical information at high spatial resolution and at the same time over large areas in order to grasp heterogeneities within the biofilms. The hardness of minerals associated with the softness and hydrated nature of cells further complicate the use of standard methods. Here we review multiple spatially resolved techniques that have been applied to biofilm-mineral assemblages or may be particularly useful for this purpose, including light (OCT and CLSM) and electron (SEM, TEM, FIB) microscopies, vibrational and X-ray spectroscopies, as well as atomic force microscopy and vertical scanning interferometry. We also emphasize the promising developments that may push such investigations to a new era.
