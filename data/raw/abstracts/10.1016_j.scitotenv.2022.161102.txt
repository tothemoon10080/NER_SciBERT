Wildfires play a critical role in regulating soil carbon (C) budgets in peatland ecosystems, and their frequency and intensity are increasing owing to climate change and human activities. Wildfires not only emit CO2 during the combustion process but also produce pyrogenic carbon (PyC), which accumulates in the soil C pool and influences soil C decomposition. However, the role of PyC after a fire in peatland soil C mineralization has rarely been examined. This study investigated the effects of PyC addition on peatland soil C mineralization and its potential driving mechanisms using an anaerobic/aerobic incubation experiment with peat soils collected from typical peatlands in the Great Khingan Mountains, Northeast China. The effect of PyC was more pronounced under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions. The mean C- mineralization rates of soil were significantly increased by 45.2 ± 15.5 % and 87.6 ± 14.3 % with 10 % PyC250°C addition after the initial stage (D7) of aerobic and anaerobic incubation, but PyC600°C addition caused a to decrease. Compared with PyC600°C, PyC250°C addition significantly increased the available N content and altered the soil microbial activities, which may be the primary reason for the increase in C mineralization rates. Furthermore, adding a high concentration of PyC (10 %) reduced the concentration of phenolics but increased phenol oxidase activity, which promoted C mineralization rates. Thus, PyC250°C addition to peat soils mainly influences the microbial biomass C content through the accumulation of available N and phenolics, which ultimately positively affects C mineralization rates.
