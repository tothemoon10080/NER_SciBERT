The efficiency of physical separation techniques of heavy minerals usually encounters some set-backs. The reason is often not far from the inability to develop suitable mineral characterization strategies in order to comprehend/evaluate certain physicochemical features such as surface chemistry, specific gravity difference, magnetic and electrical responses distributed among the mineral particles. The intense need for the development/advancement of efficient gravity concentration route on heavy minerals, more especially for the recovery and upgrade of fine, near-dense, low-grade heavy mineral deposits cannot be over-emphasized. However, the process application of gravity concentration on heavy minerals has not been widely investigated, and has often times been neglected. Existing literature on investigations conducted does not completely incorporate process routes, operating principles, parameters and applications; and as such, information in this area is somewhat scanty, hence the purpose of this study. A bulk of more recently developed gravity concentration medium such as enhanced gravity concentrations possess essential potentials which can be applied in certain physical beneficiation routes. On this premise, the need for further investigation is highly imperative. This review is therefore aimed at revealing the advantageous features of enhanced gravity concentrations over the conventional techniques, as well as the process selection for optimal beneficiation and high-grade yields. Thus, process applications, operating mechanism/principles, general performance evaluation in treating/upgrading heavy minerals using gravity techniques, the merits/shortcomings involved in conventional/enhanced gravity concentrators and recommendations have been captured in this review. This study will thus contribute greatly to the body of knowledge in the physical treatment/concentration of heavy minerals.
