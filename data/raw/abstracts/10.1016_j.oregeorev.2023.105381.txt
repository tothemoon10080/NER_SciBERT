Data-driven mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) based on deep learning methods has become a powerful tool for mineral exploration targeting in the past years. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in this field because of their powerful ability to capture the complex spatial geo-anomalies related to mineralization. However, the exploration big data applied to MPM mainly relies on the high dimensions of evidence layers (other than spatial dimensions), namely, a large number of channels. This impedes the extraction of key channel features related to mineralization when using traditional CNNs. In this paper, we developed an ensemble MPM method based on CNN and Attention model: the ATT–CNN method. Specifically, a channel attention layer is added after the convolution operation of the CNN to enhance the extraction of key channel features in complex exploration data, thereby improving the feature extraction ability and prediction accuracy of CNN for MPM. A case study of W–Sn mineral prospectivity modeling in the Nanling metallogenic belt in South China was used to verify the proposed method. To alleviate the issue of training sample scarcity, we used data augmentation methods (including sliding window and random zero noise addition) when training CNN models. The results show that the prediction accuracies of the ATT–CNN model (92.949% and 94.872% using sliding window and random zero noise addition, respectively) are higher than those of the traditional CNN (91.667% and 92.308%, respectively). Moreover, the improved areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) of ATT–CNN (0.987 and 0.971) compared to those of the CNN (0.970 and 0.964) suggest that the proposed ensemble method improves the geological generalization of CNN. The high agreement with known deposits suggests that the areas targeted in this study can guide future mineral exploration of the W–Sn mineralization in the Nanling range.
