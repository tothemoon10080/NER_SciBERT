Secondary mineralization is a promising method for remediating cadmium (Cd) pollution in sediments, but the poor stability of Cd-containing secondary minerals is a bottleneck that limits the development of this approach. The existence of phosphate can enhance the formation of stable secondary minerals and points a new direction for Cd immobilization. In this research, a novel syntrophic system composed of phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) and dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria (DIRB) was established and the effect and mechanism of Cd immobilization in the system were also explored. The results showed that under the conditions of DIRB:PSB (V:V)= 3:1, syntrophic bacteria dosage of 5% and glucose dosage of 5 g/L, Cd incorporated in the secondary minerals could account for about 60% of the total Cd. In the pH range of 5–9, alkaline environment was conducive to the immobilization of Cd and the percentage of combined Cd was up to 58%, while the combined Cd in secondary minerals decreased from 62% to 56% with the increase of initial Cd concentration from 0.1 to 0.3 mmol/L. In addition, XRD, XPS, Mössbauer and other characterization results showed that secondary minerals, such as Cd exchange hydroxyapatite (Cd-HAP) and kryzhanovskite (Fe3(PO4)2(OH)3) were formed in this new system. The established syntrophic system of PSB and DIRB is thus a prospective bioremediation technology for Cd immobilization in sediments and can avoid the potential risk might be caused by the addition of phosphorus-containing materials.
