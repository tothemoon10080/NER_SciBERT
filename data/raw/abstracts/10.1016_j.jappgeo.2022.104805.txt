Considering the current economic growth that Egypt is going through, it is necessary to increase research about the exploration of mineral resources. The current study is one of those studies that aim to define highly radioactive zones at East Wadi Qena area (EWQ), Eastern Desert using airborne radiometric and remote sensing data. This area is characterized by a complex geological setting which encountered multi-phases of deformation and tectonic events. Airborne radiometric data are used for identifying the presence of uranium, thorium, and potassium in the present study. Ternary composite map is important in radioelement exploration, as they reveal the source of radioactivity. In addition, semi-quantitative statistical analysis is an effective way in calculating radiometric anomalies. Moreover, processing and classification of remote sensing data are applied for valuable mapping of alteration and mineralization zones in the granitic rocks in the considered area. In this regard, radioactive potential zones (RPZ) have been evaluated using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) through geospatial analysis tools in Geographic Information System (GIS). Five spatial maps are extracted from among the dominant and contributing factors to the concentration of radioactive elements for resolving a radioactive prediction model. The results show that EWQ area is promising for radioactive minerals exploration at diverse phases of granitic rocks, unexpectedly Dokhan volcanics and metavolcanic rocks. The integration between remote sensing and airborne radiometric data can effectively expect the radioactive favorable zones in the study site that can be help for future investigations in other difficult accessible areas.
