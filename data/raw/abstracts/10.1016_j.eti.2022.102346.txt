In this study, a low-cost synthetic mineral (LCSM), synthesized by mechanochemical treatment of several primary minerals and contains large amounts of available K

By application of LCSM, the acidity of the ferrallisols was neutralized, the base cations and available Si lacking in ferrallisols were replenished. In addition, kaolinite as the predominant clay mineral in ferrallisols, is vulnerable in the hypersaline with substantial quantities of available K

Application of LCSM can not only markedly enhance the pakchoi yield, total N and Vitamin C content but also reduce the accumulation of Cd and Pb in pakchoi. The main mechanism of LCSM on the increase of N utilization efficiency and heavy metal immobilization can be due to the reactive mineral compositions of LCSM, which can immobilize Cd and Pb by precipitation, adsorption, and ion exchange, followed by the newly formed 2:1 type clay mineral in LCSM-amended ferrallisols which can fix the dissolved heavy metal and NH
