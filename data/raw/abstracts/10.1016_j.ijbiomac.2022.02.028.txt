Bovine serum albumin methacryloyl (BSAMA) is a newly emerging photocurable globular protein-based material whereas gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) is one of the most popular photocurable fibrous protein-based materials. So far, the influence of their different structural conformations as building blocks on hydrogel properties and mineral deposition has not been investigated. Here, we compared their differences in structures, gelation kinetics, hydrogel properties, mineralization, and cell behaviors. BSAMA maintained a stable globular structure while GelMA exhibited temperature-sensitive conformations (4 – 37 °C). BSAMA displayed slower gelation kinetics and much more retarded enzymatic degradation compared to GelMA. Photocurable BSAMA (6.41 – 390.95 kPa) and GelMA hydrogels (36.09 – 199.70 kPa) exhibited tunable mechanical properties depending on their concentrations (10 – 20%). Interestingly, BSAMA hydrogels mineralized needle-like apatite (Ca/P: 1.409) with higher crystallinity compared to GelMA hydrogels (Ca/P: 1.344). BSAMA and GelMA supported satisfactory cell (MC3T3-L1) viability of 99.43 ± 0.57% and 97.14 ± 0.69%, respectively. However, BSAMA gels were less favorable to cell proliferation and migration than GelMA gels. In serum-free environments, cells on GelMA displayed a higher amount of attachment, a more elongated shape, and a longer protrusion compared to those on BSAMA (p < 0.01) during the early adhesion.
