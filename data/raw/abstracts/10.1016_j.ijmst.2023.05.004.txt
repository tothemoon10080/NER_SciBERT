This paper investigates mechanical behaviours of sandstone during post-peak cyclic loading and unloading subjected to hydromechanical coupling effect, confirming the peak and residual strengths reduction laws of sandstone with water pressure, and revealing the influence of water pressure on the upper limit stress and deformation characteristics of sandstone during post-peak cyclic loading and unloading. Regarding the rock strength, the experimental study confirms that the peak strength σ
                     p and residual strength σ
                     r decrease as water pressure P increases. Especially, the normalized strength parameters σ
