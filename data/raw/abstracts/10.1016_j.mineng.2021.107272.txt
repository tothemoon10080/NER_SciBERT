There is a lack of skilled operators for mineral processing plants in the mining sector, which might be related to the challenge of creating trainings that addresses the operator’s daily work problems. In recent years, the use of simulator-based trainings as a tool to build competence has grown in many different fields. With the help of technologies like virtual reality, these tools have been demonstrated to increase awareness and the capability of workers when compared to traditional learning methods. In this paper, a review is presented on the development and application of such technologies in simulation-based training for the training of operators of the minerals industry in the last 20 years. Proposed next steps and new technologies with the potential of improving these applications are also discussed.
