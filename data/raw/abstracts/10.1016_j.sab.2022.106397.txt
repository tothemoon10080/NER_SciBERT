Natural carbonate standards of calcite structure were analysed using a handheld Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) device to investigate the spectral applicability for quantitative analysis in the Ca-Mg-Fe-Mn carbonate system. To obtain an initial understanding of the relationship between the elemental concentrations and LIBS signals, the determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean arctangent absolute percentage error (MAAPE) for cross-validation and forecast accuracy were used, respectively. To relate the changes in spectral characteristics to the mineral content of carbonate mixtures, different spectral ratios were compared with mixture ratios between the two carbonate minerals. We found that spectral information from LIBS emission lines showed high correlations to their elemental concentration (Ca, Mg, Fe, and Mn), and their spectral ratios in carbonate mixtures showed a linear correlation with mineral content. Principal component analysis (PCA) was investigated the chemometric capability of the discrimination for carbonate minerals. This study demonstrates that handheld LIBS can be effectively applied in the field for the discrimination and identification of carbonate endmembers and their quantification for the case of mixtures.
