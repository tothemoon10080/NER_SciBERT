In order to successfully apply biochar to soil remediation such as immobilizing contaminants and sequestering carbon, the prerequisite is to maintain its strong sorption capacity for contaminants and stability after long-term aging. Simulated diagenesis was performed here to mimic real geochemical aging process of biochars with different mineral content. The results showed that biochars exhibited increasing aromaticity, thermal and chemical oxidation resistance, microporosity, but declined surface and total polarity after direct diagenesis. The involvement of minerals during diagenesis further increased the surface Fe, Al, and Si content, as well as surface polarity and thermal stability compared to direct diagenesis. Other property changes induced by mineral involvement were dependent on original biochar structure and mineral type. Diagenetic treatment slightly improved the sorption capacity of 450 and 600 °C biochars, regardless of mineral amendment. Only marginal effects were observed relating to their sorption capacity, while the structure of 250 °C biochars was most profoundly affected during diagenesis. Consequently, the simulated geochemical aging had positive effects on biochars long-term stability and ability to immobilize pollutants.
