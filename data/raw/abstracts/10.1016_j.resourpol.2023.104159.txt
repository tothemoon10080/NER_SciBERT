Natural resource conservation is a priority for many countries worldwide as climate change becomes increasingly pressing. Reforestation, mineral extraction, and natural resource depletion all play a role in the effort to mitigate the effects of climate change. This paper examines natural resource conservation outpaces and climate change nexus in China from 1971 to 2019, using mineral depletion, natural resource depletion, and forest rents as moderator variables. CO2 emissions, forest rents, mineral depletion, and natural resource depletion positively affect natural resource conservation in China. Moreover, CO2 emissions, forest rents, mineral depletion, and natural resource depletion increases natural resource conservation in China. Through increased temperatures, changes in precipitation, and rising sea levels, natural resources are negatively affected by rising CO2 emissions. Policymakers are suggested to implement policies to reduce emissions and incentivize businesses to invest in renewable energy sources and conservation efforts, prioritizing sustainable development involving utilizing resources responsibly, promoting renewable energy sources, and encouraging clean technologies through incentives, regulations, and international cooperation. Research limitations and future directions are discussed.
