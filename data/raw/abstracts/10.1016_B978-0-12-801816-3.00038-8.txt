Aside from being essential to life and to numerous critical biochemical pathways, magnesium, calcium, and potassium are minerals known to be implicated in biological aging. Their dietary intake and body concentrations modulate inflammatory, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and cellular signaling processes as well as glucose metabolism. Their action on these processes tends overall to be protective. Dietary intake of these minerals is overall linked to better cardiovascular health, lower risk of stroke and myocardial infarction, and decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. Their influence on brain aging has not been sufficiently studied but the available evidence also suggests that their intake exerts a positive influence on brain health. Finally, emerging evidence while sparse is also suggestive of a protective effect of dietary intake of magnesium, calcium, and potassium on cognitive decline and risk of dementia in old age.
