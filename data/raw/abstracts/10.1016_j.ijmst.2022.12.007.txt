The quantitative determination and evaluation of rock brittleness are crucial for the estimation of excavation efficiency and the improvement of hydraulic fracturing efficiency. Therefore, a “three-stage” triaxial loading and unloading stress path is designed and proposed. Subsequently, six brittleness indexes are selected. In addition, the evolution characteristics of the six brittleness indexes selected are characterized based on the bedding effect and the effect of confining pressure. Then, the entropy weight method (EWM) is introduced to assign weight to the six brittleness indexes, and the comprehensive brittleness index B
                     c is defined and evaluated. Next, the new brittleness classification standard is determined, and the brittleness differences between the two stress paths are quantified. Finally, compared with the previous evaluation methods, the rationality of the proposed comprehensive brittleness index B
                     c is also verified. These results indicate that the proposed brittleness index B
                     c can reflect the brittle characteristics of deep bedded sandstone from the perspective of the whole life-cycle evolution process. Accordingly, the method proposed seems to offer reliable evaluations of the brittleness of deep bedded sandstone in deep engineering practices, although further validation is necessary.
