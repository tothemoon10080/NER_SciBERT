Chalcopyrite is the main Cu-containing mineral and cannot be separated well from pyrite using traditional xanthate collectors with large amounts of lime depressant, resulting in difficulties of the tailing treatment and associated precious metals recovery. Therefore, in this study, the green and odourless ethylenediamine tetramethylenephosphonic acid (EDTMPA) was introduced as a novel chalcopyrite collector. Flotation results from the binary mineral mixture and real ore demonstrated that EDTMPA could realize the selective separation of chalcopyrite from pyrite relative to ethyl xanthate (EX) without any depressants within the wide pH range of 6.0–11.0, and might replace the traditional high-alkaline lime process. Electrochemical and Fourier transform infrared spectra measurements indicated that the difference in adsorption performance of EDTMPA on chalcopyrite and pyrite was larger than that of EX, suggesting a better selectivity for EDTMPA. Density functional theory calculations demonstrated that there were stronger chemical bonds between P—O groups of EDTMPA and the Fe/Cu atoms on chalcopyrite in the form of a stable six-membered ring. Crystal chemistry calculations further revealed that the activity of metal atoms of chalcopyrite was higher than that of pyrite. Therefore, these basic theoretical results and practical application provide a guidance for the industrial application of EDTMPA in chalcopyrite flotation.
