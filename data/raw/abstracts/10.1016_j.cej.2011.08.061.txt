Different single treatments and a combined process based on two advanced oxidation processes, catalytic wet peroxide oxidation and photocatalysis, have been tested for the purpose of achieving complete mineralization using phenol as target compound at medium-range concentration (200mgLâˆ’1). The heterogenous catalysts that were used were a home-made activated carbon-supported iron catalyst (FeCN), and the commercial Aeroxide titania P25. An important improvement in the rate and percentage of TOC removal was achieved by combining both catalysts in a hybrid process based on a mixture of FeCN and TiO2 P25 (50:50wt.%) in the same photoassisted reactor in ambient conditions. TOC evolution has been modelled for all the treatments for comparative purposes. The hybrid process allowed a highly efficient use of hydrogen peroxide with the almost complete oxidation of phenol to CO2 and H2O by using the theoretical stoichiometric amount of H2O2. Among the different advantages of this hybrid process is the rapid and effective degradation of the aromatic compounds adsorbed onto the Fe/CN catalyst surface as a consequence of synergistic effect of the two catalysts in the presence of irradiation light in ambient conditions, achieving a higher degree of mineralization of short-chain organic acids that are resistant and refractory to CWPO treatment. Finally, the stability and durability of this catalytic mixture (FeCN+titania P25) in hybrid mode have been examined through four consecutive cycles. A constant organic matter removal was observed during the last three consecutive cycles in which 90% of total organic carbon conversion was achieved.
