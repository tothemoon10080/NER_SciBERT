The global pandemic of COVID-19 has led to an increased interest in herbal infusions as natural remedies since 2020. This has also heightened the need for controlling the composition of these dietary supplements to ensure consumer health and prevent food fraud. In the present work, various mass spectrometry techniques were used to analyze the organic and inorganic composition of 23 herbal infusion samples. UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS was used to determine target, suspect, and nontarget polyphenolic compounds. Thus, 8 phenolic compounds were identified in the target analysis and additionally, 80 extra-compounds were identified through suspect and nontargeted screening. ICP-MS was used to monitor the metals released during tea leaf infusion, providing a complete mineral composition of each sample. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Discriminant Analysis (DA) were utilized to identify relevant compounds for differentiating and grouping the samples, thus serving as specific markers to detect potential food fraud.
