The synchronous nitrogen elimination and phosphorus (P) recovery can be realized by the novel one-stage partial nitritation/anammox (PN/A)-hydroxyapatite (HAP) crystallization (PN/A-HAP) process, which seems promising in actual application. This research firstly conducted the startup of the PN/A-HAP process based on reconciling biomass and mineral to cultivate the novel sludge with the strategy of alternating enhancement of biomass accumulation and mineral formation. Within three months, the nitrogen removal rate of 1.1 kg/m3/d and the P removal efficiency of 54.2% were achieved. The biomass reached to 3.7 g/L and the average particle size of sludge granules was about 260 μm. The microbial analysis indicated that in sludge the ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) mainly belonged to the genus Nitrosomonas, and the anammox bacteria mainly the genus Kuenenia. The main mineral in sludge was identified as HAP. This startup strategy is guidable for the application of one-stage PN/A-HAP process in actual wastewater treatment.
