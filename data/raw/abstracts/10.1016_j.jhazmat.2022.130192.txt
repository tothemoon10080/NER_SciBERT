While extensive works focused on the enhancement of the activity of heterogeneous Fenton catalysts, little was paid attention to the inhibition of soil organic matter (SOM) and Mn minerals in soil remediation. Here, the oxidation of petroleum hydrocarbons in soils (S1: 4.28 % SOM, S2: 6.04 % SOM, S3: 10.33 % SOM) with inactivated SOM and passivated Mn oxides regulating by calcium superphosphate (Ca(H2PO4)2) was carried out. Oily sludge pyrolysis residue was used as precursors to prepare an oleophilic iron-supported solid catalyst (Fe-N @ PR). For regulated systems, under the optimal conditions of 1.8 mmol/g H2O2 and 0.05 g/g Fe-N @ PR, 72 ∼ 91 % of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs: 15,616.58 mg/kg) were oxidized, which was 38 ∼ 45 % higher than that of control systems. The mechanism of efficient oxidation was proposed that the passivated Mn minerals stabilized H2O2 redistributing more H2O2 to sustainably produce •OH, and the inactivated SOM improved the relative reactivity of •OH to TPHs. Additionally, the passivation of Mn oxides was mainly related to the binding of H2PO4
                     -, and the inactivation of SOM was realized by Ca2+ combing with -OH and C-O-C to form stable complexes. This study brought us a new perspective on soil remediation through passivating Mn minerals and inactivating SOM.
