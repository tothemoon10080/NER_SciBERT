This study investigated inulin and calcium-rich milk mineral incorporation into a pork sausage in order to examine the effects on microbiome and biochemical activity in the gastrointestinal tract upon ingestion. Rats (n = 48) were fed one of four sausages; a pork sausage enriched with 1) inulin (6.0%) and milk mineral (3%), 2) inulin (6.0%), 3) milk mineral (3%) or 4) control sausages without enrichment. NMR-based metabolomics revealed that inulin-enrichment increased the fecal concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Milk mineral-enrichment also increased SCFA concentrations, although less pronounced. In addition, milk mineral reduced the concentration of nitroso compounds in feces and small intestinal content. Combined enrichment with both inulin and milk mineral showed no cumulative effect on SCFA formation and seemed to oppose the milk mineral-induced reduction of nitroso compound formation. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing indicated that alterations of the gut microbiome contributed to the observed effects.
