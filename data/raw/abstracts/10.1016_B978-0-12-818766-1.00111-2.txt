In the context of dairy ingredient technology, ’milk minerals’ may refer to a calcium phosphate-rich ingredient prepared from a dairy stream. These streams are generally casein-free and include various types of whey and permeate. Manufacturing the ingredient is based on the selective precipitation of calcium phosphate, which can then be recovered using centrifugal separation prior to washing and drying. The ingredient finds application primarily as a nutritional fortificant. The challenge in expanding the applications base includes the limited physical stability of the milk mineral ingredient.
