Schizophyllan is a natural polysaccharide that has shown great potential as enhanced oil recovery (EOR) polymer for high-temperature, high-salinity reservoirs. Nevertheless, the adsorption behavior of schizophyllan over carbonate minerals remains ambiguous element towards its EOR applications. Here, we investigate the adsorption of schizophyllan on different carbonate minerals. The effect of mineral type, salinity, and background ions on adsorption is analyzed. Our results indicate the adsorption capacity is higher on calcite and dolomite compared to silica and kaolin and the adsorption capacity decreases with salinity. Moreover, the adsorption kinetics follows pseudo-second order mechanism regardless of the mineral type. Adsorption over calcite is diminished in presence of water structure making ions and enhanced in presence of structure breaking ion and in presence of urea. Gel permeation chromatography results reveal the preferential adsorption of longer chains. The adsorption over carbonate minerals proceed via complex formation between polymer molecule and mineral surface.
