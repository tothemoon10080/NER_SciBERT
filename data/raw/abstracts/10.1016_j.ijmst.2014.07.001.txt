Based on the techniques of X-ray diffraction analysis, identification of the thin sections of core cast, physical analysis and scanning electron microscopy analysis, this paper studied the reservoir characteristics of the Carboniferous strata in Donghe well No.1 of Tarim region. The results show that the reservoir lithology is mainly the fine-grained quartz sandstone with ferrocalcite and pyrite, mud cement-based, the permeability concentrated in 5–40×10–3μm2, a small part of the high permeability up to 150–327×10−3
                     μm2 and porosity ranged from 10% to 20%. The most part of the reservoirs is low permeability with a small part of the layer in moderate-high permeability. The types of reservoir space include intergranular pores, intra particle-molding pores, micro-pores and cracks, which mainly are intergranular pores with the pore diameter of 15–200μm, 95.5μm on average. And the types of the throats are complex with the main type of constricted throats in this area and large contribution to the permeability.
