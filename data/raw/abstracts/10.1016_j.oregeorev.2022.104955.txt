The complexity of geochemical patterns in the surficial media makes it necessary to consider the uncertainty in the process of identifying geochemical anomalies. The existence of various anomaly detectors that define geochemical anomaly under different assumptions, constitutes an important source of such uncertainty. In this study, the model averaging strategy was applied to combine the predictions of three different anomaly detectors, i.e., local singularity analysis, autoencoder network and one-class support vector machine, with the aim of accounting for this type of uncertainty. The receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve were used to evaluate the model performance. A case study of processing the stream sediment geochemical samples in Northwest Sichuan Province, China was presented to illustrate the procedure. The results indicate that: (1) model averaging can further improve the predictive performance with respect to the individual anomaly detector, which hence serves as an alternative approach to account for model uncertainty; (2) geochemical anomalies patterns identified by the model averaging approaches show strong correlations with known mineralization in the study area, and those associated with low uncertainty and favorable geological evidence (e.g., fault) provide valuable information for mineral exploration at a later stage.
