The ability to interrogate the dynamic internal characteristics of minerals processing plant, such as separation vessels, mixers, hydraulic and pneumatic conveyers, using conventional instrumentation is severely limited for most practical conditions, since at high solids concentration the mineral constituents are optically opaque. The results of recent work using alternative methods employing non-instrusive electrical sensors to obtain 2-dimensional images of component concentration profiles in cross-sections through process equipment are described in this paper. Examples of two types of electrical tomographic methods are given to observe solids flow in pneumatic conveying and solid/liquid/gas flow in mixers and hydrocyclone separators. Prospects for applications of the method to other unit operations in minerals processing are reviewed.
