Aimed at the CMS laser scanning theory and characteristic, a combined actual situation of stope N4–5 of Fankou Lead–Zinc Mine and complementary monitoring of the stope were carried out by carefully choosing two measuring points. The cavity 3D visible model was created by large-scale mining industry software Surpac after changing the measured data. The stope mine design model, bottom structural model and backfill model of the south and north sides of the stope N4–5 were established according to the stope design data. On this basis, the stope block model was established, and then block attribute was estimated. The amount the ore remains, mullock, backfill and total mined ore were calculated through the solid model restrains. Finally, the stope mining dilution rate and loss rate reached 8.2% and 1.47%, respectively. The practice indicates that the mining index visible calculation method based on cavity 3D monitoring and stope block modeling can make up the deficiency of adopting the solid model to directly carry out the Boolean operation. The stope mining indexes obtained by this method are accurate and reliable, and can be used to guide the actual production management and estimate the mining quality.
