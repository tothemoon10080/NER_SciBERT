The filtration and dewatering of fine clean coal not only ensure industrial water recycle in coal washing plant, but also reduce the moisture of coal product in order to meet the requirements of combustion or coking industry. Fine clean coal is mainly composed by organic matter, and the property difference of different organic matter determines the filtration and dewatering behavior. In this investigation, vitrinite and inertinite were separated from a clean bituminous coal, and the comparative filtration and dewatering behavior of vitrinite and inertinite were conducted. The results showed that inertinite has lower dewatering rate and higher filter cake moisture than vitrinite. The analysis of filter cake structure showed that inertinite particle is easier to be broken into small particles due to the difference of mechanical properties, thus forming more compact filter cake than vitrinite. The analysis of particle surface properties showed that vitrinite is more hydrophobic than inertinite, which makes water easier drained from filter cake. The simulation study showed that the structure of inertinite is more porous than that of vitrinite, and the interaction between inertinite and water is stronger than that between vitrinite and water. This study provides a theoretical basis for improving coal dewatering by selectively improving coal maceral hydrophobicity.
