We used micro-Raman spectroscopy to analyze volcanic ejecta from the 7 March 2012 phreatic eruption at Old Crater (Million Dollar Hole) on Ioto Island, Izu-Bonin arc, Japan, to assess the ability of this technique to identify clay and other alteration minerals in volcanic ejecta. We also analyzed five reference clay minerals (kaolinite, dickite, pyrophyllite, montmorillonite, and saponite) using the same technique. Dickite, montmorillonite, gypsum, pyrite, marcasite, quartz (α-quartz), and anatase were identified by comparison with spectra of the reference materials and published databases. These minerals occur in close spatial association with each other. Marcasite, quartz, and anatase in aliquots of the sample were not observed by a previous powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) study. The presence of dickite, montmorillonite, gypsum, quartz, marcasite, and anatase indicates that these alteration minerals were likely derived from the acidic alteration zone (150–190 °C) below the crater on Ioto Island. Our results demonstrate that Raman microspectroscopy, compared with conventional XRD, is a more sensitive technique for identifying and characterizing alteration minerals present in the volcanic ejecta. However, owing to the strong fluorescence from clay minerals during Raman analysis, the presence of other minerals in the sample may be overlooked. Therefore, the use of the two techniques in combination can be a powerful tool for obtaining a full understanding of mineral phases in volcanic ejecta from phreatic eruptions, thereby providing more accurate information on the hydrothermal conditions below volcanic craters.
