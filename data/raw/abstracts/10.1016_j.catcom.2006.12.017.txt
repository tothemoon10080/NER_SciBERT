A novel regenerative catalytic system has been developed using cerium and ozone in nitric acid medium. It was found that cerium(III) was oxidized to cerium(IV) by ozone in nitric acid medium with good conversion yields. The conversion rate of Ce(III) was measured under various parameters viz. ozone–air flow rate, initial concentration of Ce(III), and concentration of nitric acid at 25°C. It was found that the conversion of Ce(III) increased with increasing ozone flow rate and concentration of nitric acid while decreased with increasing Ce(III) concentration. The pseudo first order kinetic constants were evaluated for Ce(III) oxidation. The efficiency of this hybrid system comprising of ozone and cerium redox pair towards organic mineralization was evaluated taking phenol as the model organic pollutant and compared with Ce(III) catalyzed and uncatalyzed ozonation processes. The presence of Ce(III) catalyst increased the destruction efficiency of phenol compared to uncatalyzed ozonation whereas a synergetic effect was observed between the cerium redox pair (Ce(III) and Ce(IV)) and ozone towards phenol mineralization and a maximum TOC removal was obtained in the latter case. Kinetic interpretations have been made with some simplifying assumptions owing to the much complex nature of ozone and metal ion interactions. This hybrid catalytic ozonation process may find its suitability for continuous organic destruction at room temperature.
