Mineralization of the ZIF-8 in the presence of biomacromolecules has been demonstrated to be a general way for making bioentities@ZIFs composites. The ZIF-8 crystals permit controlled storage and utilization of the bioentities, thus can benefit drug delivery, cold-chain breaking etc. With the increasing needs on personal care and distributed manufacturing, automated synthesis controlled by a computer becomes the next challenge. In this work, we designed an automatic synthesis system to prepare PEG mineralized ZIF-8 composite particles. This system is based on flow chemistry with the microfluidic chips fabricated by femtosecond laser micromachining. The particles were synthesized and monitored automatically. Furthermore, this synthesizer could be extended for fabrication of vaccine particles under remote control through internet.
