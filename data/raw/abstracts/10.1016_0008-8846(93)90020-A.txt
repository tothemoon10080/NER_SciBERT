                      on the hydration kinetics was studied by X-ray diffraction analysis, and differential calorimetry. The surface area of the phases controls the concentrations of different ions in the non-equilibrium liquid phase and by this way determines the mechanism of formation of hydrated products in the system. Results show that the particle sizes of the anhydrite influence significantly on the kinetics and mechanism of precipitation of hydrates in the initial period. Whereas in the presence of fine particles of C2S leads to the retardation of reaction processes.
