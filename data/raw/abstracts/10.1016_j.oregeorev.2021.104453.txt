Compositional zoning is common in magnetite from different geological environments, but its formation mechanism remains controversial. Here, we characterize micron- to nano-scale textural and chemical variations in zoned magnetite from the Sossego iron oxide-copper–gold deposit (Carajás, Brazil) using electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Lack of porosity and of a reaction front at both the micron and nanometer scales indicates that compositional zoning in magnetite is a pristine texture formed during crystal growth, rather than a secondary texture due to dissolution and reprecipitation reaction. TEM energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry analyses and mapping identify four types of nanoinclusions in zoned magnetite: 1) Mg-Fe-Al silicates, most likely amphibole, 2) Fe-Ti oxides, mainly ilmenite, 3) pyroxene, 4) Si-rich magnetite. The formation of ilmenite nanoinclusions in Sossego magnetite is possibly due to oxy-exsolution of ulvöspinel from Ti-rich magnetite, whereas nanoinclusions of other minerals likely formed by local supersaturation in the fluid boundary layer, followed by magnetite crystal entrapment. Compositional zoning in magnetite likely formed by a self-organization process where fluid composition fluctuations are feedback responses for an evolving fluid system far from equilibrium, rather than cyclic variations in external factors such as temperature and oxygen fugacity. Saturation of silicate minerals results in relative depletion of Si, Ca, and Al in boundary layer fluids, and formation of inclusion-poor zone depleted in these elements. Nanoinclusions in magnetite highlight the importance of textural characterization when using in situ chemical composition to discriminate the origin of magnetite. In addition, the assemblages of nanoinclusions in magnetite can be used to complement the discrimination of magnetite origins.
