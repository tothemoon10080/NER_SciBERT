Mixed mesophilic and extreme thermophilic bioleaching were evaluated to remove copper from the molybdenite concentrate. Bioleaching tests were carried out in shake flasks and in a 50-L bioreactor. The shake flask tests were performed with different inoculum size, solids density, pH, and temperature in order to identify optimum conditions. The highest amount of copper elimination, 75% was obtained with extreme thermophilic microorganisms (at 12% inoculation, 10% solids, 65째C and a pH of 1.5). The highest copper elimination by mesophilic microorganisms was 55% (at 12% inoculation, 5% solids, 30째C at pH 2). The optimum conditions in shake flask tests were applied to 7days batch tests in a 50-L bioreactor. Extreme thermophilic experiment gave the best copper elimination of 60% (at 12% inoculation, 10% solids, 65째C and pH 1.5). Mesophilic test removed 50% of the copper (at 12% inoculation, 10% solids, 35째C at pH 2).
