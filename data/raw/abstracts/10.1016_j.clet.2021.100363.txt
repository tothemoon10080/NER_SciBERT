In a mineral separation process such as in the production of metals, the embodied exergy used in the process is important for sustainability. Currently, using or elaborating embodied exergy indicators are relevant in metal production according to ore grades, once the decline in ore grades requires more exergy in metal production processes. Mineral reserves are limited and there is a tendency in increasing mineral demand, specifically for the rarest of which. This article aims to identify whether there is a published measurable proportion used to evaluate embodied exergy involved in metal production as an ore grade function. A systematic longitudinal review through thematic areas and subdomains is the main methodology applied in this paper, with a wide review ranging from the years 1847–2020, and a more specific review ranging from 1973 to 2020. In these reviews keywords such as: metals, ore-deposits, minerals, ore-grades, life-cycle, mining-industry and exergy were obtained, revealing that most reviewed articles relate earth's crust mineral concentration to the mining industry. Three research groups declare that when ore grades tend to zero, embodied energy/exergy involved in metal productions increases. None of the articles from the three groups of researchers we reviewed use a direct proportion between ore-grades and an embodied exergy. We suggest a useful proportional measurement, which is: “for each 50% mineral concentration variation, at least 100% additional exergy is used in the process. In a spontaneous or natural process, this proportion is possibly 100% variation in the exergy used for every 50% variation in the concentration of matter. This can help to assess the exergetic efficiency of technological systems and natural systems.
