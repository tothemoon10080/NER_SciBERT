Carbonatites of the Central Taimyr region, formed during the early Triassic (246.5 ± 1.9 Ma), are coeval with other occurrences of alkaline‑carbonatite magmatism of the Siberian LIP and related to the Siberian superplume activity. Petrological characteristics indicate that Central Taimyr carbonatites were derived from an alkaline-carbonatitic melt source with remarkably high concentrations of chloride-phosphate-fluoride-sulfate brines. Magmatic minerals (bearing F-Ba-Sr-REE ores), represented by calcite, fluorite, barite, bastnaesite-(Ce) and fluorapatite, were formed at a temperature range of 720–550 °C by brine-melts. Whereas, hydrothermal mineral assemblages (bearing F-Ba-Sr-REE ores), including magnetite, hematite, monazite-(Ce), parisite-(Ce), fluorite, roscoelite, rutile (Nb), barite, quartz, calcite, dolomite, as well as sulfides and uraninite, occur within a late-stage ore-forming processes, for which mineralized fluids of sulfate-fluoride-chloride‑carbonate and chloride-hydrocarbonate compositions were responsible. Significant changes in the composition of fluid inclusions occurred as the homogenization temperature varied from 460 to 230 °C, and concentrations from 55 to 25 wt% NaCl-eq, respectively.
