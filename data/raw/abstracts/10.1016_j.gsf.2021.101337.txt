Geo-electric anomalies are generated during the process of stress accumulation and release associated with earthquakes. However, the mechanism of these anomalies remains equivocal. Based on the analysis of thermoelectric characteristics of semiconductor minerals of the earthâ€™s deep crust such as graphite, ferrosilicon alloy, magnetite etc., we perform finite element analysis to evaluate the principles governing the thermoelectric power generated by minerals and rocks. The results show that graphite, ferrosilicon alloy and magnetite all exhibit Seebeck effect and can be superimposed. And the thermo-electric field can be enhanced with the activation temperature increases, the content of thermoelectric minerals increases, the size of aggregates increases, and the spacing of thermoelectric minerals grains decreases. Seismogenic processes would generate a similar thermal gradient. The natural semiconductor minerals in this thermal field show a thermoelectric effect, forming a thermoelectric field that interferes with the background electric field. This study indicates that thermoelectric effect may have an important influence on the formation of geoelectric field.
