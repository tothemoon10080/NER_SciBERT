The promotion of carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction methods is due to the fact that the CO2 concentration has been increasing rapidly in 21st century. In order to prevent further damage of the environment caused by greenhouse gases, CO2 concentration should be stabilized by increasing CO2 fixation, which can reduce CO2 emission into the atmosphere. Mineral carbon sequestration or mineral carbonation is the process of utilizing minerals, mostly rich in calcium and magnesium (Ca/Mg) as the feedstock in reaction with CO2 to produce stable solid carbonates. Mineral carbonation through indirect pH swing process is a very effective method for producing calcium and magnesium carbonates. The Ca/Mg ions are extracted out of feedstock using suitable solvents at low pH condition and then in the second step the leached Ca/Mg ions are carbonated at elevated pH condition. In this paper the state-of-the-art of the carbonation involving pH swing method is updated.
