Commercial cultivation of elite and non-itchy genotypes of underutilized legume Mucuna pruriens L. is required for food security as well as for meeting the demand of naturally available aromatic amino acid L-Dopa. Comprehensive studies were conducted in bower and surface-grown production systems at different periods during 2013–2020 at Bengaluru, India. The elite genotypes were examined for their suitability in food and pharmaceutical sectors based on seed yield, L-Dopa content, protein content and nutrient profile. Bower-training system increased the seed yield (0.73–2.38 t ha−1) and L-Dopa yield (19–140 kg ha−1) over surface-grown system. In general, long duration genotypes registered higher seed and L-Dopa yields. The genotype Arka Shubra registered significantly higher L-Dopa content (5.17–5.43 g per 100 g) in bower and surface-grown production systems. Similar yield levels (2.39–2.47 t ha−1) and L-Dopa content at higher nutrient levels, and significant effects of nutrient uptake on seed yield (R

The protein content was comparable in leaf (24.4–29.1%) and seed (25.5–28.6%). Long duration genotypes are ideal for commercial cultivation and for further use in food and pharmaceutical sectors.
