Natural iron-bearing minerals are widely distributed in the environment and show prominent catalytic performance in pollutant removal. This work provides an overview of groundwater restoration technologies utilizing heterogeneous electro-Fenton (HEF) techniques with the aid of different iron forms as catalysts. In particular, applications of natural iron-bearing minerals in groundwater in the HEF system have been thoroughly summarized from either the view of organic pollutant removal or degradation. Based on the analysis of the catalytic mechanism in the HEF process by pyrite (FeS2), goethite (Î±-FeOOH), and magnetite (Fe3O4) and the geochemistry analysis of these natural iron-bearing minerals in groundwater, the feasibility and challenges of HEF for organic degradation by using typical iron minerals in groundwater have been discussed, and natural factors affecting the HEF process have been analyzed so that appropriate in situ remedial measures can be applied to contaminated groundwater.
