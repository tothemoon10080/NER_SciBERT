The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that genetic variability is the key driver of mineral concentration in wheat grain in Mediterranean conditions. We grew 12 modern winter wheat varieties in semi-arid conditions and alkaline soils, in two consecutive years of contrasting water availability, and at three rates of N-fertilization: 64, 104, and 130 Kg N/ha. The genotype was the main driver of [Ca], [K], [Mg], and [S] in wheat grain, while the environmental conditions were more relevant for [Fe] and [Zn]. The nitrogen fertilization rate had little effect. The thousand-grain weight correlated negatively with the mineral concentration in the grain, revealing the importance of grain shape. CH-Nara grains were highly nutritious making this variety a potential source of germplasm. The knowledge gained from this study will guide future breeding and agronomic practices and guarantee food safety in the region in the advent of climate change.
