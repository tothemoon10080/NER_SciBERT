In order to better understand the prevailing mechanism of CO2 storage in coal and estimate CO2 sequestration capacity of a coal seam and enhanced coalbed methane recovery (ECBM) with CO2 injection into coal, we investigated the preferential adsorption of CH4 and CO2 on coals. Adsorption of pure CO2, CH4 and their binary mixtures on high-rank coals from Qinshui Basin in China were employed to study the preferential adsorption behaviour. Multiple regression equations were presented to predict CH4 equilibrium concentration from equilibrium pressure and its initial-composition in feed gas. The results show that preferential adsorption of CO2 on coals over the entire pressure range under competitive sorption conditions was observed, however, preferential adsorption of CH4 over CO2 on low-volatile bituminous coal from higher CH4-compostion in source gas was found at up to 10MPa pressure. Preferential adsorption of CO2 increases with increase of CH4 concentration in source gas, and decreases with increasing pressure. Although there was no systematic investigation of the effect of coal rank on preferential adsorption, there are obvious differences in preferential adsorption of gas between low-volatile bituminous coal and anthracite. The obtained preferential adsorption gives rise to the assumption that CO2 sequestration in coal beds with subsequent CO2-ECBM might be an option in Qinshui Basins, China.
