The use of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) as a tracer gas for analyzing underground mine ventilation systems has been practiced for over 30years. As a result, the methods used to release, sample, and analyze SF6 are well accepted. As the complexity and size of underground mine ventilation networks increase, the ability of a SF6 to function as a convenient and rapid means of analysis diminishes. The utilization of multiple tracer gases can mitigate this by removing the need to purge the background presence of a tracer before conducting another release and allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation using multi-zone techniques. Recent studies have identified perfluoromethylcyclohexane (PMCH) as a possible supplement for SF6 in underground mine ventilation tracer studies. However, the deployment of PMCH remains a challenge because of this compounds physical properties. This paper evaluates a PMCH permeation plug release vessel (PPRV) under controlled turbulent conditions. The details of the experimental parameters used in the evaluation as well as a discussion regarding the performance of the PPRV are included.
