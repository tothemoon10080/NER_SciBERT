Geological data provide information necessary for discovering mineral resources. Geological mapping is deemed a prerequisite for most exploratory surveys and constitutes many stages, including observing lithological and structural features in the field and recording these features on a map. The information collected in the field must be factual and thorough, gathered by many methods in traversing. In addition, since a preliminary knowledge of structural mapping, petrography, mineralogy, and stratigraphy is an asset for geological mapping, these issues will be thoroughly covered in this chapter.
