The exploration and exploitation of mineral resources in the international seabed area is conducive to alleviate the global resource crisis. However, these activities are facing huge challenges due to the extreme difficulty, high risk and cost, and unpredictable impact on the deep-sea environment. With the method of literature analysis and social network analysis, this article studies the roles and challenges of different participants in deep-sea activities in China, and put forward suggestions to optimize the functions of stakeholders. Key findings demonstrate that Chinese managers, deep sea mining companies, scientific research institutions, the International Seabed Authority and International non-governmental organizations are the major stakeholders engaging in deep-sea activities of China; the challenges faced by different stakeholders mainly come from three aspects: Law, environmental protection and technology. Finally, recommendations are proposed to promote the sustainable development of deep-sea activities in China based on the aforementioned three aspects.
