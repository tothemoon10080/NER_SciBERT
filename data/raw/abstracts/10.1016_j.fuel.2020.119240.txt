The combustion of some types of biomass leads to the formation of ash deposits, which reduce the efficiency and reliability of boiler equipment. The mechanism of formation of these deposits is still not fully understood. The aim of this work is a comprehensive study of the mineral part of the flour-milling waste (wheat bran) to determine the possibility of using them as fuel. Separation of bran into fractions with different densities by sedimentation was carried out in the work. X-ray fluorescence analysis and scanning electron microscopy were used as the main research methods. As a result of the study, it was found that the mineral part of wheat bran is sintered at a temperature of above 675 °C. It has been suggested that in the process of bran combustion, the Ca/K ratio is an essential factor affecting the sintering of the ash residue. It was experimentally shown that the addition of calcium carbonate to bran in an amount of 3 wt% and more eliminates the sintering of the ash residue.
