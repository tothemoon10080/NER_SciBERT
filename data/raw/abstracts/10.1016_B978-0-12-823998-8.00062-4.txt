Noise as an environmental hazard remains a perennial issue in mineral industry which increases with mechanization. It is estimated that 12.4% –25.7% mining and processing workforce are suffering from noise-induced hearing loss in India. Both area noise survey and personal noise dosimetry conducted to assess magnitude of problem in coal and mineral processing plants. Area noise levels in more than 50% of the samples exceeded 90 dB(A). The noise levels within control cabins (70.2–81.5 dB) fell below stipulated warning limit of 85 dB(A). Out of 27, 19 personal noise samples exceeded the stipulated 8 h exposure limit while they crossed danger limit value of 90 dB in six samples. Noise levels reported in the present study are not much different from those in the studies of the 1970s and 1980s. Overall severity of exposure might have decreased over the years but still rendering the plants unhealthy.
