Carbonyl compounds (CCs) can migrate from bottles to mineral water because of plastic degradation. An exploratory analysis of the presence a significant number of CCs (14) in bottled mineral water with and without gas in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) containers was performed using ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS). The data from the analysis was submitted to chemometric treatment (principal component analysis, PCA). Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and benzaldehyde were found in all samples (0.07–125 ng mL−1). Acrolein and acetone were present in 81% and 75% of the samples, respectively. The concentration of acrolein in carbonated water was up to 3.8 times greater than that measured in non-carbonated water (0.07–0.44 ± 0.01 ng mL−1). PCA analysis showed that gasification can influence the composition of CCs present in mineral water and that the plastic material of the bottles is a likely source of CCs. In addition, benzaldehyde levels may be associated with the use of recycled materials.
