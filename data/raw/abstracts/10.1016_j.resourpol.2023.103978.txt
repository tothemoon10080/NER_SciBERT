The mining industry's value chain is gradually changing in order to manage current assets more effectively and boost production. The nature of mining has not changed much over the years, despite the industry's ups and downs. Rethinking how the mining industry functions is necessary for a breakthrough in efficiency and performance. In light of the significant obstacles that digital transformation must overcome to be successfully implemented in dangerous mine environments, an overview of the significance of digital transformation in the mineral industry with a focus on improved safety, productivity, environmental sustainability, and reduced mining accidents is reviewed. The application of digital technology indicates that technological innovations have improved the productivity of mines because processes are optimized and human error is reduced. This paper has demonstrated that there is a concrete history of technological and digital advancements that, whether on purpose or not, correlate with elements of the 4th industrial revolution and have been effectively applied in discrete domains within the mineral industry. A gap between what can still be done and how it should be done to ensure a sustainable supply of minerals is also revealed by these developments. Overall, this paper identifies various improvement that has taken place over the years in the mining industry that assisted to reduce hazards and risks in working areas due to technological advancement.
