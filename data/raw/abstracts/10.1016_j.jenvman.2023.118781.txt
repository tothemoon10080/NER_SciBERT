The hazards caused by Pb pollution have received worldwide attention. Phosphogypsum (PG) and titanium gypsum (TG) have the disadvantage of limited adsorption capacity and poor dispersion when used as heavy metal adsorbents on their own. The excellent pore and electron transfer capacity of biochar makes it possible to combine with PG and TG to solidify/stabilize Pb2+. In this study, the mechanism of Pb2+ adsorption/immobilization by rice husk biochar (BC) combined with PG/TG was investigated in terms of both mineral formation and electron transfer rate. The removal rate of Pb2+ by BC composite PG (BC/PG-Pb) or TG (BC/TG-Pb) was as high as 97%â€“98%, an increase of 120.9% and 122.5% over BC. Adsorption kinetics and mineral precipitation results indicate that the main removal of Pb2+ from BC/PG-Pb and BC/TG-Pb is achieved by PG/TG induced Pb-sulfate and Pb-phosphate formation. The addition of PG/TG significantly enhances the formation of stable Pb-minerals on the biochar surface, with the proportion of non-bioaccessible forms exceeding 50%. The four-step extraction results confirm that P and F in PG/TG are key in facilitating the conversion of Pb minerals to pyromorphite. The rich pore structure of biochar not only disperses the easily agglomerated PG/TG onto the biochar surface, but also attracts Pb2+ for uniformly dispersed precipitation. Furthermore, the excellent electrical conductivity and smooth electron transfer channels of biochar facilitate the reaction rate of Pb2+ mineralization. Overall, the use of biochar in combination with PG/TG is a promising technology for the combination of solid waste resourceisation and Pb remediation.
