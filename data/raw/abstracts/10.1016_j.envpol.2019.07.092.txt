The long-term use of animal manure in agriculture has resulted in estrogen pollution, which poses risks to facility vegetable soils. Owing to the complex soil composition, estrogen may exhibit a variety of behaviors at the water/soil interface. This study demonstrated the role of humic acid (HA) on the 17β-estradiol (E2) adsorption by clay minerals (montmorillonite, kaolinite, and hematite). The interfacial behaviors were investigated using adsorption kinetics and isotherms data. Then, the effects of temperature, pH, and bisphenol A (BPA) on the interactions between humic-mineral complexes and E2 were explored. The adsorption of E2 is an exothermic and spontaneous process, and the addition of HA to minerals significantly promoted their E2 adsorption capacities. Higher pH levels (>10) and the presence of BPA decreased the adsorption capacities of minerals and mineral complexes for E2. Moreover, intercalation, hydrophobic partitioning, π-π interactions and hydrogen bonding could dominate the E2 adsorption onto complexes. These results provided insight into the interfacial behaviors of E2 on the surfaces of humic-mineral complexes and promoted the understanding of the migration and transport of estrogens in soils.
