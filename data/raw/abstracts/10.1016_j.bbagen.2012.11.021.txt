Background
                  Enamel synthesis is a highly dynamic process characterized by simultaneity of matrix secretion, assembly and processing during apatite mineralization. MMP-20 is the first protease to hydrolyze amelogenin, resulting in specific cleavage products that self-assemble into nanostructures at specific mineral compositions and pH. In this investigation, enzyme kinetics of MMP-20 proteolysis of recombinant full-length human amelogenin (rH174) under different mineral compositions is elucidated.
               
                  Methods
                  Recombinant amelogenin was cleaved by MMP-20 under various physicochemical conditions and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF MS.
               
                  Results
                  It was observed that mineral ions largely affect cleavage pattern, and enzyme kinetics of rH174 hydrolysis. Out of the five selected mineral ion compositions, MMP-20 was most efficient at high calcium concentration, whereas it was slowest at high phosphate, and at high calcium and phosphate concentrations. In most of the compositions, N- and C-termini were cleaved rapidly at several places but the central region of amelogenin was protected up to some extent in solutions with high calcium and phosphate contents.
               
                  Conclusion
                  These in vitro studies showed that the chemistry of the protein solutions can significantly alter the processing of amelogenin by MMP-20, which may have significant effects in vivo matrix assembly and subsequent calcium phosphate mineralization.
               
                  General significance
                  This study elaborates the possibilities of the processing of the organic matrix into mineralized tissue during enamel development.
