Based on the safety coefficient method, which assigns rock failure criteria to calculate the rock mass unit, the safety coefficient contour of surrounding rock is plotted to judge the distribution form of the fractured zone in the roadway. This will provide the basis numerical simulation to calculate the surrounding rock fractured zone in a roadway. Using the single factor and multi-factor orthogonal test method, the evolution law of roadway surrounding rock displacements, plastic zone and stress distribution under different conditions is studied. It reveals the roadway surrounding rock burst evolution process, and obtains five kinds of failure modes in deep soft rock roadway. Using the fuzzy mathematics clustering analysis method, the deep soft surrounding rock failure model in Zhujixi mine can be classified and patterns recognized. Compared to the identification results and the results detected by geological radar of surrounding rock loose circle, the reliability of the results of the pattern recognition is verified and lays the foundations for the support design of deep soft rock roadways.
