Objectives
                  The objectives of the study were: (i) to compare mineral values of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc and their ratios, in teeth from Croatian populations that lived in different historical periods, namely the Medieval period, the early 20th century, and the 21 st century; and (ii) to elucidate the influence of diet and lifestyle on tooth quality in these groups.
               
                  Design
                  Determination of mineral content (Ca, Mg, P and Zn) in 294 teeth from three different periods of history (Medieval Period [G1], Second World War period [G2] and the contemporary period [G3]) using atomic absorption spectrometer and UV/VIS spectrometer methods.
               
                  Results
                  Our results showed that the mineral content in teeth has changed over the centuries. Between analysed samples from all groups, there were significant differences in the elemental content as well as in the interrelationship of the elements. The largest differences were observed in the mean values of magnesium and zinc concentrations while smaller differences were observed for changes in calcium and phosphorus.
               
                  Conclusions
                  From the obtained results, it is evident that there are changes in the tooth mineral composition in specimens centuries apart that could be a reflection of changes in eating habits, food quality and the environment. In addition to differences in individual elements, differences in their mutual ratios were also observed.
