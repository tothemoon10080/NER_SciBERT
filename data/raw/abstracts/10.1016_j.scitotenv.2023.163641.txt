The effects of exotic plants on soil nitrogen (N) transformations may influence species invasion success. However, the complex interplay between invasive plant N uptake and N transformation in soils remains unclear. In the present study, a series of 15N-labeled pot experiments were carried out with Solidago canadensis L. (S. canadensis), an invasive plant, and the Ntrace tool was used to clarify the preferred inorganic N form and its effects on soil N transformation. According to the results, nitrate-N (NO3
                     −-N) uptake rates by S. canadensis were 2.38 and 2.28 mg N kg−1 d−1 in acidic and alkaline soil, respectively, which were significantly higher than the ammonium-N (NH4
                     +-N) uptake rates (1.76 and 1.56 mg N kg−1 d−1, respectively), indicating that S. canadensis was a NO3
                     −-N-preferring plant, irrespective of pH condition. Gross N mineralization rate was 0.41 mg N kg−1 d−1 in alkaline soil in the presence of S. canadensis L., which was significantly lower than that in the control (no plant, CK, 2.44 mg N kg−1 d−1). Gross autotrophic nitrification rate also decreased from 5.95 mg N kg−1 d−1 in the CK to 0.04 mg N kg−1 d−1 in the presence of S. canadensis in alkaline soil. However, microbial N immobilization rate increased significantly from 1.09 to 2.16 mg N kg−1 d−1, and from 0.02 to 2.73 mg N kg−1 d−1 after S. canadensis planting, in acidic and alkaline soil, respectively. Heterotrophic nitrification rate was stimulated in the presence of S. canadensis to provide NO3
                     −-N to support the N requirements of plants and microbes. The results suggested that S. canadensis can influence the mineralization-immobilization turnover (MIT) to optimize its N requirements while limiting N supply for other plants in the system. The results of the present study enhance our understanding of the competitiveness and mechanisms of invasion of alien plants.
