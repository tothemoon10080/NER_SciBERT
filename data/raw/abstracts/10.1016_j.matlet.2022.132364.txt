The ideal material for bone defect requires promising bioactivity and matching mechanical properties. In this study, uniform polydopamine (PDA) nanospheres were prepared by a simple and effective process and doped into the β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP)/ Calcium phosphate dibasic (MCPA)-based bone cement. The results revealed that the hydroxyapatite (HA) phase appeared in the cement compositions after adding 1.5 wt% of PDA nanospheres. In addition, the most striking observation was that the micro-nano-filling effect of PDA nanospheres and lath-like HA on the internal pores of cement significantly increased the compressive strength to more than twice. Moreover, the apatite mineralization capacity of 5 wt% PDA-doped nanospheres was considerably superior to that of undoped cement, and the mechanism of enhanced mineralization properties of PDA nanospheres was proposed. Hence, it is suggested that the mechanical properties and bioactivity of the cement can effectively improve with the incorporation of PDA nanospheres.
