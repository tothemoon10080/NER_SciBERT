The progress of the GAG gas flow in a conveyor drift is investigated. The output of a calculation model is evaluated and compared with experimental results from full-scale inertisation experiments. Expressions presenting the fastest and most extensive condensation of water resulted in well fitted arrival times of the GAG gas front. A common denominator for the two sets of expressions is that the type of flow is considered and thus better fitted to the actual flow situation. The model was further refined to include the surface roughness factor in the condensation calculations, which resulted in time lengths even closer to the measured time length. The measured rapid temperature increase at certain positions along the conveyor drift was found to fit well with the calculated GAG gas front arrival at the corresponding positions. The magnitude of the GAG flow was found to have a large impact on the arrival time of the GAG gas front. Knowing and understanding the GAG gas behaviour would increase the likelihood of successful inertisation of all or part of a mine.
