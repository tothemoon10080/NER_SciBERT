Despite lots of techniques in improving the heap leaching performance, many constraints on the industrial applications remain. We proposed a correspondingly effective and new idea of introducing forced aeration to improve the bad permeability and leaching effect of Yangla Copper Mine (YCM) during heap leaching. The dual-media theory was employed to study the impact mechanism of forced aeration on the variations of porous and fractured media during the column leaching experiments. An X-Ray Computed Tomography (CT) set was utilized to perform the pore imaging of the specimens and the fracture morphology of the particles within the columns was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) as aeration rate (AR) changed. The results show that there exists copious fine particles within the heap of YCM, the particle size distribution of which is not reasonable. The forced aeration can not only promote the development of the porous and fractured structures but effectively break the blocked seepage paths. Then the leaching degree is improved and the seepage performance of the solute within the solution is enhanced. Therefore, the forced aeration is probable of making the leaching performance greatly improved.
