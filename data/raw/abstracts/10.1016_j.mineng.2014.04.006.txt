The original geometallurgical model for the Namakwa Sands deposit was modified to accommodate ore blends in addition to the various single ore types. A process mineralogy approach was followed in a structured and systematic manner to evaluate the integrity of the adjusted model, particularly for ilmenite and zircon, the minerals of highest intrinsic value. This study reproduced recovery relationships predicted by the geometallurgical model for each of the key process functions, and as a result the integrity of the geometallurgical model is validated. Overall, the recovery potential determined for ilmenite and zircon are well adjusted to model estimates. Poor mineral liberation, an anomalously high abundance of garnet and pyroxene and variation in particle chemistry are recognized as the key recovery penalties. The gangue content is the most significant constraint to ilmenite recovery, whereas zircon chemistry is the most important negative factor in the production of a premium quality zircon product. Results of this study contributed to the refinement of the current geometallurgical model and also identified opportunities to optimise mineral resource utilisation in the future.
