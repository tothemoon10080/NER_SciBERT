The Evidential Belief Functions model was used for investigating the geochemical and geophysical anomalies and delineating the Pb–Zn mineralization zones in the Chichakloo area, east of Takab, Iran. In addition, we evaluated the uncertainty of geochemical and geophysical results in the detection of mineralization zones. For this purpose, the individual belief, disbelief, plausibility, and uncertainty functions of geophysical and geochemical predictor maps were assigned and then integrated using belief function equations. The obtained belief map reveals a remarkable potential for Pb–Zn mineralization in the east part of the study area with a conservative estimation of more than 50% and uncertainty of less than 10%. An increase in conservative estimate and a decrease in the uncertainty rate in this zone, compared to any of the other individual exploration predictor maps, indicate remarkable overlapping anomalies. The results of drilled boreholes proved the existence of the Pb–Zn mineralization and confirmed the obtained mineral potential map.
