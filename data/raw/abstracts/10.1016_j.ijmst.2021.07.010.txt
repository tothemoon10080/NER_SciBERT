During the development of hot dry rock, the research on thermal fatigue damage caused by thermal shock of cold and heat cycles is the basis that ensures the long-term utilization of geothermal resources, but there are not enough relevant studies at present. Based on this, the thermal damage tests of granite at different temperatures (250, 350, 450 °C) and quenching cycles (1, 5, 10, 15 cycles) were carried out. Preliminary reveals the damage mechanism and heat transfer law of the quenching cycle effect on hot dry rock. The results show that with the increase of temperature and cycles, the uneven thermal expansion of minerals and the thermal shock caused by quenching promote the crack development of granite, resulting in the decrease of P-wave velocity, thermal conductivity and uniaxial compressive strength of granite. Meanwhile, the COMSOL was used to simulate the heat transfer of hot dry rock under different heat treatment conditions. It concluded that the increase in the number of quenching cycles reduced the heat transfer capacity of the granite, especially more than 10 quenching cycles, which also reflects that the thermal fatigue damage leads to a longer time for the temperature recovery of the hot dry rock mass. In addition, the three-dimensional nonlinear fitting relationship among thermal conductivity, temperature and cycle number was established for the first time, which can better reveal the change rule of thermal conductivity after quenching thermal fatigue effect of hot dry rock. The research results provide theoretical support for hot dry rock reservoir reconstruction and production efficiency evaluation.
