The interactions between clay minerals and organic matter, specifically adsorption, are widely recognized as a crucial mechanism for promoting the preservation of organic matter within sedimentary environments. This paper discusses the genesis and adsorption of clay minerals, especially their influence on the process of organic matter enrichment in sedimentary environments. The composition of clay minerals found in sediments serves as an indicator of both the climatic and lithological characteristics of the provenance area. Smectite formation is favored in mafic provenance, while the coexistence of illite and chlorite suggests cold and arid conditions. Additionally, an abundance of kaolinite indicates intense chemical weathering of the provenance area. The physical and chemical properties of clay minerals and organic matter significantly influence adsorption. Smectite is thought to adsorb more organic matter due to its greater surface area. Selective adsorption of high molecular weight, aromatic, and aliphatic compounds dissolved organic matter onto mineral surfaces may have played a role in kerogen formation. Moreover, the preservation of organic matter via clay mineral adsorption is intricately linked to the sedimentary environment. Disparities in nutrient elements during the clay minerals synsedimentary period can impact biological productivity. Furthermore, the pH and solution metal ions of the water column influence the quantity and type of organic matter adsorbed. The contribution of adsorption to organic matter preservation is influenced by redox conditions, and this contribution can be observed through density separations. Additionally, we present several recommendations for future research. Firstly, diagenesis alters the clay mineral assemblage in sedimentary rocks. However, it may be possible to reconstruct the clay mineral assemblage based on morphological, mineralogical, and chemical composition characteristics. Secondly, studies have indicated that clay minerals can facilitate the precipitation of carbonate minerals, providing insights into the formation of abiotic carbonate minerals. Finally, the practical applications of clay minerals in shale oil and gas exploration are underscored, such as their ability to predict sweet-spot areas and control reservoir properties.
