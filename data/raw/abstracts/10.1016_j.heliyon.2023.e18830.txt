Climatic variability and the scarcity of rainfall have intensified the process of soil salinization, leading to land degradation and loss of rice yield. A field experiment was conducted to study the effect of cultural mode and organo-mineral fertilizers on rice performance and soil chemical properties. A split plot design with four replications and two factors that were cultural mode (flat and ridge) and fertilizers (mineral, organic, organo-mineral, and control) was carried out. Observations on growth, yield parameters, and yield of rice and soil chemical properties (pH and EC) were recorded. The cultural mode influenced significantly rice performance. Height (76.26 cm), tillers (89.93 m-2), panicles (71.66 m-2), biomass (3252.25 kg ha−1), 1000 kernel weight (12.85 g) and yield (1123.14 kg ha−1) were significantly higher in ridge than flat. However, infertility (44.74%), sterility (58.04%), and survival (91.86%) were higher in flat than ridge mode. However, sowing of rice on ridges with mineral and organo-mineral amendments improved yield parameters increasing the yield of rice more than in flat mode. Soil chemical properties were significantly influenced by cultural modes and fertilizers. Ridge mode increased the soil pH and reduced the salinity more than in flat. Organic and organo-mineral fertilizers affected significantly the soil's chemical parameters by improving the pH and reducing the salinity. Ridge mode combined with organo-mineral amendment improved rice performance and soil chemical properties. Cultural modes and fertilizer types were critical elements to improve soil pH, salinity, and yield.
