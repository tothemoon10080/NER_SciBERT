Micro-nanobubbles (MNBs) generated during hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) have been extensively studied in mineral processing field in the past two decades. Many researchers have claimed that MNBs can effectively promote the collection of fine particles in flotation, while studies on MNBs assisted mineral separation are rare. In this study, the role of bulk MNBs in desorbing flotation reagent was investigated, with the aim of illustrating the potential effects of MNBs on minerals separation. The results showed that bulk MNBs could efficiently remove the sodium oleate (NaOl) from diaspore surfaces, reducing the residual concentration of NaOl on solids, which was more significant when the amount of NaOl pre-adsorbed was relatively small. Furthermore, lower residual concentration of NaOl on solids caused by MNBs cleaning made the particles less hydrophobic and flocs more friable. Given that gangue entrapment in flocs was one of the main limits for high-selective flotation, the roles of MNBs in enhancing reagent desorption and associated flocs breakup and reorganization probably contribute to higher separation efficiency of different minerals, which was confirmed by the flotation results of diaspore/kaolinite mixture.
