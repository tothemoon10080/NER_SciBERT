The high cost of energy and the consumption of almost three times the net theoretical heat required in clinkering process continue to be a nagging problem faced by VSK plants. There is, therefore, a need for energy conservation which could be rapidly and economically accomplished by promoting the clinker formation at lower temperature. The use of fluxes for lowering the melting point of the raw mix is an important measure to save energy, giving economic benefits. Fluxes and mineralizers improve burnability and quality of clinker, solving particularly the free lime problem faced by cement plants.
                  The purpose of the present paper is to highlight the role of CaF2 and CaSO4 as mineralizers with industrial raw mix in VSK technology in conserving energy and improving the quality of clinker. The use of CaF2, CaSO4, or a mixture of CaF2 and CaSO4 promotes the clinker formation at lower temperature, giving direct implication on commercial production with economic benefits without affecting the quality.
