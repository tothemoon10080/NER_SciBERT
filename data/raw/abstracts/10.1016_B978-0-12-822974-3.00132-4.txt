Major primary minerals in soils include feldspars, quartz, micas, and olivines, amphiboles and pyroxenes as accessory minerals. Weathering of these minerals serves as a template for various secondary minerals and to supply elements for the crystallization of secondary minerals in soil environments. Primary minerals are the source of many essential plant nutrients and also provide pH buffering capacity to soils. The weatherability of primary minerals in soils depends on their structural (e.g., points of weakness in the structure) and chemical properties (e.g., presence of Fe2+ iron), and environmental conditions. The structure and composition of common primary minerals and their weathering products in soils are described in this chapter.
