Electron microprobe analyses of the uranium, thorium and lead content of minerals are able to provide a reliable age for those minerals without recourse to isotopic methods. The result is known as the “chemical age.” The Pb content of these minerals is mainly derived from radiogenic decay of the U and Th rather than being Pb present at the time of formation. The method has been successfully applied to minerals such as uraninite (UO2), monazite (Ce, La, Nd, Th(PO4) and zircon (ZrSiO4) that have a measurable U and Th content when those minerals are old enough to have accrued enough radiogenic Pb. Proposed in 1990 there are now microprobe laboratories (some using the name Ultrachron) dedicated to these measurements. The advantages of the method are the ease of use in conjunction with other petrological studies, especially in cases where the minerals analyzed show zonation or the presence of multiple generations that can be related to different moments during their formation.
