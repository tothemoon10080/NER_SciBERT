We previously reported a xanthan gum (Xan) hydrogel showing excellent mechanical properties. Mineralization of hydroxyapatite (Hap) upon the Xan hydrogel would provide a unique biomaterial applicable for bone tissue engineering. Here, we show the mineralization of Hap upon the Xan hydrogel by means of an alternate soaking process. Hap was gradually grown upon the Xan-matrix surface with increasing number of soaking cycles due to the ionic interactions between calcium cations and carboxyl groups. Interestingly, the mineralization induced a microstructure change in the gel-matrix from a layered structure to a porous structure. The mechanical properties of the resulting Hap–Xan composite hydrogels were further investigated by a tensile test, where the Hap–Xan composite hydrogel with an appropriate amount of Hap (Xan/Hap=2.7) was capable of approximately 370% elongation.
