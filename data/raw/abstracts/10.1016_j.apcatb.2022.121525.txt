Herein, we report a hydrogen peroxide-free resin photo-Fenton system with separation-free, low-cost, and strong mineralization ability of efficiently degrading organic pollutants (phenols, endocrine disruptors, antibiotics, and dyes). Based on the synergistic effect of hydroxyl radicals and holes, the corresponding degradation rate for Bisphenol A (BPA) was 11 times and 14.6 times higher than that of P-g-C3N4 and CdS/rGO photo-self-Fenton, respectively. The excellent performance is mainly attributed to a nearly 100% reduction of iron ions by electrons and promoted hydrogen peroxide utilization of 82.1%. Meanwhile, the introduction of strong oxidizing holes (2.15Â eV) prevented the generation of macromolecular polymer intermediates, leading to a directly aromatic ring-opening and high mineralization efficiency (67%). This work exhibits a promising role of resin in visible-light photo-self-Fenton systems, offering a new route for eco-friendly and efficient wastewater treatment.
