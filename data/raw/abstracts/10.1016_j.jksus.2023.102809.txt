The numerous hydrothermal alteration zones and subsurface structures affecting the mineralized deposits of the Dungash region were identified using aeromagnetic data. The Center of Exploration Targeting (CET) approach and several filters, such as reduction-to-pole, Tilt derivative, First Vertical Derivative, Horizontal gradient map, Downward continuation, analytical signal methods, regional, and residual separation, were used to analyze the aeromagnetic data. The research region is impacted by several structural trends running in the N-S, E-W, NW-SE, and NE-SW directions, and these trends are strongly related to the gold mineralization and surrounding hydrothermal alteration zones. In the NW-SE direction, four alteration zones have been identified. The research region's northern and eastern regions have shallower basement relief, with depths of only approximately 100Â m, and those depths show that the area is rootless. Conversely, the basement relief and surface depths are lower in the study region's western and southern regions. The routes taken by the ascending hydrothermal fluids can be seen as aeromagnetic lineaments at the hydrothermal alteration zones. Mineralization appears to be linked to structural lineaments, as evidenced by airborne magnetic data. For gold prospecting, the aeromagnetic technique seems to be the most effective and efficient geophysical method because gold is typically found in severely deformed shear zones and faults.
