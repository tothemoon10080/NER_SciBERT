The microflotation of three single minerals, mixed coal–kaolinite and mixed coal–montmorillonite were examined to study the effects of clay and calcium ions on coal flotation. The results show that the ash content of flotation concentrate increases by 3% in the presence of clay minerals, and the ash content would further increase by 3% in co-presence of clay minerals and high concentration of Ca2+. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and elemental spectrum analysis indicate that fine clay particles that coat on the coal surface, which is called slime coating, can affect the coal flotation. The slime coating would be induced much more easily in the presence of Ca2+.
