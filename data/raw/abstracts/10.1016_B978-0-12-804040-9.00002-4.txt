Most countries throughout the world require some form of environmental impact assessment (EIA) of major mining projects expected to have significant impact on the quality of the human environment, before such projects can be approved and undertaken. Environmental impact assessments define and analyze potential environmental impacts, identify ways to mitigate negative impacts, and are vital for sound, cost-effective, and sustainable decision making. This chapter presents a 10-step systematic procedure for preparing environmental impact analyses for mining and mineral processing using a matrix approach that relates a list of project activities to affected environmental attributes. The approach is based upon experience and processes used in the United States and many other industrialized countries.
