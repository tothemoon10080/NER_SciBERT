It is strongly believed that tremendous resources of precious metals and oxides are hidden in the West Ethiopian region. The present work presents a significant test to conduct oriented geochemical mapping for forty-two elements combined with typical geological features in the Pan-African basement exposed area using stream sediment and rock samples. The stream sediments most likely contain some elements directly derived from the surrounding Precambrian to Tertiary bedded metamorphic and igneous intrusive rock units. The obtained data suggest high economic potentials for Au (2.14 ng/g), Cu (43.56 μg/g), Cr (365.1 μg/g), Ni (69.2 μg/g), Co (34.46 μg/g), V (204.1 μg/g), Ti (13278 μg/g), Mn (1472 μg/g), Fe2O3 (10.97 %), P (888 μg/g), Al2O3 (14.05 %), Ba (501.7 μg/g), Zr (309.5 μg/g), Sr (155.7 μg/g), and Nb (28.2 μg/g). In the composite geochemical anomalies maps, anomalous zones HS12, HS16, HS18, HS19, HS20, and HS28 suggest that transitional metals of intense differentiation with high average contents as compared to Chinese recommended values may be the favourable focus of exploration in the migmatitic gneiss (Cu ∼ 66.38 μg/g), granitic orthogneiss (Zr ∼ 426.9 μg/g), upper basalt/lower basalt (Nb ∼ 63.4 μg/g), meta-volcanic (Mn ∼ 2680 μg/g, Ti ∼ 29823 μg/g, V ∼ 365.6 μg/g, Fe2O3 ∼ 1629 %), meta-sedimentary formation (Au ∼ 5.3 ng/g), Abshala tectonic melange (Cr ∼ 2457.1 μg/g), and meta-ultrabasic rocks (Co ∼ 62.65 μg/g, Cu ∼ 66.38 μg/g, Ni ∼ 313.4 μg/g). In conclusion, fifteen ore-forming elements are distinctively abnormal in the area with sixty-four new discovered mineralized spots.
