Non-thermal plasma mineralization of the adsorbed toluene over γ-Al2O3 hybrid with 13X, ZSM-5, and HY was investigated in a sequential adsorption and plasma oxidation system. The γ-Al2O3-13X was shown to have a better plasma oxidation performance with fewer by-products as compared to γ-Al2O3-ZSM-5 and γ-Al2O3-HY, which was due to its better discharge performance and O3 decomposition ability. For all of the tested materials, the plasma mineralization of the adsorbed toluene process had a good match with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model: kt = 1/n - 1/n
                     o, where n
                     0 and n are the amount of adsorbed toluene (mmol) at discharge time = 0 and t, respectively. The overall reaction constant (k) was shown to be affected by the packing materials. The reason for the kinetic model following the pseudo-second-order in the sequential process was analyzed based on the chemical reaction and mineralization mechanism.
