Sesame seeds, which are rich in some potential nutraceutical compounds such as enolics and unsaturated fatty acids, are widely used in the bakery and confectionery industries, and are the main source of tahini product. In this study, the effect of sesame seed process steps on bioactive compounds (total phenol, total carotenoid, antioxidant activity), fatty acid composition, phenolic compounds and nutrient contents of raw and roasted sesame seed and sesame paste (Tehina) and oils was investigated. Analyzes were carried out by spectrophotometric and chromatographic methods. The antioxidant activities and total phenol amounts of sesame seed and tehina samples were recorded between 8.09 (roasted sesame) and 74.76% (raw sesame) to 44.44 (tehina) and 170.28 mgGAE/100 g (raw sesame seed), respectively. Linoleic and oleic acid amounts of samples were identified between 42.77 (tehina oil and 43.73% ( roasted seed oil) to 40.95% (tehina) and 41.51% (dehulled seed), respectively. Also, (+)-catechin contents of seed and tehina samples varied between 11.40 (tehina) and 89.66 mg/100 g (raw seed). In addition, gallic acid contents changed between 12.45 (tehina) and 35.05 mg/100 g (raw seeds). Ca amounts of samples were determined between 4316.18 (dehulled seed) and 16,445.94 mg/kg (roasted sesame seeds). In addition, K contents of samples were recorded between 3154.48 (dehulled seed) and 19,595.77 mg/kg (roasted seed). As a result, the processing stages of tehina production affected the oil result, bioactive components, fatty acid composition, mineral contents and phenolic compounds of the product. In addition, the quantitative values of phenolic compounds generally decreased with the dehulling of sesame seeds.
