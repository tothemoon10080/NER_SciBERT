This paper investigates the feasibility of mechanical activation as a pre-treatment method as part of an integrated mineral carbonation process for a nickel mining operation in British Columbia. The physical, structural and chemical characteristics of forsterite and lizardite in mine waste rock after mechanical activation were monitored to determine their CO2 sequestration efficiency for a direct aqueous carbonation process. Economic analysis on the process was developed through considering the energy requirements, cost modeling and carbon balance. Mechanical activation on mining residue reduced the particle size, enlarged the surface area, distorted the crystal structure of forsterite, and enhanced the CO2 sequestration efficiency. However, it didn't create new phase or induce phase transfer between forsterite and lizardite, and distort the crystal lattice of lizardite. The optimum condition for 60% CO2 sequestration efficiency was found at mechanical activation for 210 kWh t−1 ore and carbonation for 260 kWh t−1 ore, which had an operating cost of 104.1–107.1 $ t−1 CO2 avoided. Using mechanical activation, the integrated mineral carbonation plant in the mine can potentially sequester 14.62 Mt y−1 CO2 using mine waste rock and tailings during the 28-year life of mine.
