The use of solid recovered fuels (SRF) is often associated with an increased risk of chloride corrosion because these fuels can be high in chlorine and alkali. One way to reduce the risk of chloride corrosion is the co-combustion of fuel mixtures in the presence of a mineral additive containing chemical compounds that bind the emitted chlorides. This paper concerns the influence of mineral additives â€“ constituting waste material, on the process of the binding of emitted chlorides. One of these waste materials could be a halloysite, not yet used in power industry. The research has shown its high chloride binding effectiveness, comparable to that of kaolin (known in literature as a mineral additive effectively binding chloride). Moreover, the studies have shown that SRF combustion in the presence of stabilized, dried and granulated sewage sludge, with a 25% mass fraction of sewage sludge, allows reducing chloride emissions. Studies are based on tests in a calorimetric bomb.
