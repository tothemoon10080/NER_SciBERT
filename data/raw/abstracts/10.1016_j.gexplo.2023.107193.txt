Supergene Au deposits have attracted economical attention because of their increased grades and more environmentally leaching. Understanding the supergene processes responsible for the Au mobilization in the surface environments is important to determine the location of concealed Au deposits. In this study, we recognized and sampled three Au-rich spatial zones in the Shangmanggang deposit in southwestern China: the hypogene, semi-oxidized, and red clay zones. The microscopic and chemical analyses of Au-bearing minerals show that (i) gold is mostly present as lattice-bound Au+ in the pyrite within the hypogene zone and (ii) numerous fine Au grains, mostly 100 × n nm to 1 × n μm in size, with a granular, spindle, or irregular shape, have been widely observed in the semi-oxidized and red clay zones, mainly inside the fissures and cavities of limonite. When exposed to an oxidizing environment, primary pyrite in the hypogene zone is gradually oxidized into limonite. With S diffusing out of the limonite, the Au in pyrite becomes rapidly activated and also diffuses into the environment as Au(S2O3)2
                     3− with a neutral or weakly alkaline pH in karst terrains. When meteoric water containing Au(S2O3)2
                     3− infiltrated the regolith profile, Au+ was reduced to elemental Au and precipitated in the limonite cavities and fissures due to their difference in the pH with the soil solution, which is an important insight into the formation of Au grains inside the limonite in the regolith. These results could provide a reference to better understand Au mobilization in the immature laterite in SW China, as well as the exploration of a potential hypogene Au deposit covered by the lateritic profile.
