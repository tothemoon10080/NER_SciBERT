The phosphate family of compounds is reviewed. The IUPAC nomenclature is used with reference to former names summarized as a glossary. Aspects of the chemistry of polyphosphates are introduced which may help identify potential applications of interest to the mineral engineer. General applications are described and current and possible uses in mineral flotation considered. The strong metal ion polyphosphate complexes that form may find use in controlling metal ions in flotation which can cause accidental activation/depression.
