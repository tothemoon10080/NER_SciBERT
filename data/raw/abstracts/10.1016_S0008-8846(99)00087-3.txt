The numerical simulation of corrosion processes can be a valuable tool for the planning of durable structures exposed to chemical attack and for planning of their maintenance and repair. In this paper, a simulation model—incremental in time and space—of corrosion of mineral-building materials is described. The model combines the calculation of transport processes with the quantitative simulation of chemical reactions. The following transport processes are incorporated: capillary suction, diffusion of solved species (including the influence of the diffusion potential), water vapor diffusion, and diffusion of solved species through the inner surface of cracks. The reactions are simulated by the repeated calculation of the thermodynamic and kinetic stable phase assemblage. Due to the thermodynamic module, the simulation does not depend on the specific reaction. Additional modules are incorporated for the actualization of transport parameters and material strength as well as for the expansion in the case of sulphate attack.
