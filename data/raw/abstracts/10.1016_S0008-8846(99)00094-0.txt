A model for the simulation of corrosion processes of mineral building materials is provided. The model combines the calculation of several transport processes with the quantitative simulation of the chemical reactions. The model was verified by experiments on the corrosion of cement mortar by sulfate solutions and acid, the corrosion of cement mortar and concrete in a seepage water treatment plant (ammonium attack), and the corrosion of a sandstone with calcitic binder by acidic solutions with and without sulfate content. The corresponding simulations were calculated using solely the properties of the uncorroded materials (experimentally determined or estimated by the literature). The comparison of the measured and calculated corrosion behaviour lead to the conclusion that the algorithm is able to simulate very different corrosion processes without any change of the model, despite some difficulty in detail.
