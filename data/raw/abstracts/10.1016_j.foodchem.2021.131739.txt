The study evaluated the effect of goat and cow milk processing on the bioaccessibility of calcium, magnesium and zinc using different methods following the static in vitro simulation of gastrointestinal digestion: solubility and dialysis models. Raw goat and cow milks were processed to obtain pasteurized milk, yogurt and cheese. In general, goat milk and dairy products presented higher bioaccessibility of Ca and Mg than cow milk and dairy products. The milk processing affected the minerals bioaccessibility indicating the importance of food structure, composition and minerals equilibrium on the in vitro digestion and bioaccessibility prediction. The potential absorptions of Ca and Zn were higher in cheeses when compared to the milks and yogurts, independently of the method used. The minerals bioaccessibility evaluated by the solubility method was higher than the obtained by dialysis method for all the products evaluated.
