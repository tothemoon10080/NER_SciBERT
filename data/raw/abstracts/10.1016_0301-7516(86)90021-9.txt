The material balancing problem seeks to transform observed data taken from a mineral processing circuit into a data set satisfying mass conservation. Here entropy forms the basis for this analysis. Developed to model matter in physics and chemistry using the multinomial distribution, entropy has been valuable in determining the most probable state of an observed physical system. For this problem the entropy model combines disparate data such as flow rates, assays and particle size distributions to produce a consistent data set. Two actual data sets are analyzed using entropy and results are compared with a least-squares approach.
