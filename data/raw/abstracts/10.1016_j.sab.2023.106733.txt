Fast and precise identification of minerals in geological samples is of paramount importance for the study of rock constituents and for technological applications in the context of mining. However, analyzing samples based only on the extrinsic properties of the minerals such as color can often be insufficient, making additional analysis crucial to improve the accuracy of the methods. In this context, Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy mapping is an interesting technique to perform the study of the distribution of the chemical elements in sample surfaces, thus allowing deeper insights to help the process of mineral identification. In this work, we present the development and deployment of a processing pipeline and algorithm to identify spatial regions of the same mineralogical composition through chemical information in a fast and automatic way. Furthermore, by providing the necessary labels to the results on a training sample, we can turn this unsupervised methodology into a classifier that can be used to generalize and classify minerals in similar but unseen samples. The results obtained show good accuracy in reproducing the expected mineral regions and extend the interpretability of previous unsupervised methods with a visualization tool for cluster assignment, thus paving for future applications in contexts requiring high-throughput mineral identification systems, such as mining.
