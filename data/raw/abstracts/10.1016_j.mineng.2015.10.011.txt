The paper reviews the modern characterization techniques for flocs. Flocculation is playing an integral role in mineral processing. In the solid liquid separation processes, flocculation can speed up particle settling and dewatering. Also, flocculation can increase concentrate recovery or reduce gangue mineral entrainment in the flotation processes. The effect of flocculation is highly related to floc property. The characterization techniques for three kinds of floc property, namely floc size, floc shape and structure and floc strength, are reviewed in this paper.
