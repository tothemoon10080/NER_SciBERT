This paper reports a key note for introduction the subject of mineral raw materials in the symposium Raw Materials, Processing and Applications, at the Material's 2013 Congress, that was held in Portugal in March 2013, promoted by Sociedade Portuguesa de Materiais (SPM). In the first part, some concepts about mineral deposit and technological upgrading of mineral raw materials are reviewed. Comminution is then presented not only as a typical size reduction process but also as a process that generates the liberation of mineral phases as a pre-requisite for mineral separation seen as size or grade Partition Processes. In the second part, information about the Portuguese potential for mineral raw materials, provided by LNEG Portuguese Geological Survey, is presented. Finally an overview about EC policy for Raw Materials and the Portuguese Government strategy for the mining sector is briefly explained.
