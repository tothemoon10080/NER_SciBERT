The Wuyi metallogenic belt can be divided into the South and the North Wuyi metallogenic belt by the ENE-trending Nanping–Ninghua–Ganzhou Tectonic Belt. In the Wuyi metallogenic belt, Paleozoic mineralization, which has caused typical deposits such as the Yongping, Fenglin, and Yushui Cu deposits and the Makeng Fe deposit, exhibits notable variations. However, systematic research on the controlling factors of these mineralization episodes is lacking. In order to understand the Paleozoic minerlization in the Wuyi metallogenic belt, we study the genesis of typical deposits in Wuyi metallogenic belt. The phenomenon of “basal ore control” was observed as different basement units control different ore types in the Wuyi metallogenic belt. We believed that Paleozoic mineralization in the Wuyi metallogenic belt includes siliceous–carbonate Jingshe, Lindi, and Chuanshan Formations, which are related to the Fe–Mn deposits such as the Makeng Fe deposit, Dapai Fe–Pb–Zn deposit, and Luoyang Fe deposit in the Southwest Fujian Province, carbonate formations of the Hutian Group related to Cu deposits such as the Yushui Cu deposit in the North Guangdong Province of the southern Wuyi region, and the Carboniferous Outangdi Formation related to the Yongping and Fenglin Cu deposits in the Northeast Jiangxi Province of the northern Wuyi region. Based on a systematic analysis on typical metallogenic deposits and basement characteristics in the Wuyi metallogenic belt, we proposed that the Paleozoic mineralization is not only controlled by Paleozoic strata and Mesozoic magmatism, but also by the basement. The basement controls Paleozoic Cu mineralizations in the southern and northern Wuyi regions. However, Fe–Mn mineralization is mostly related to Late Paleozoic sedimentation. The superposition and transformation of Mesozoic magmatism to the basement and Paleozoic strata is an indispensable factor in the Cu and Fe–Mn mineralizations in the Wuyi metallogenic belt.
