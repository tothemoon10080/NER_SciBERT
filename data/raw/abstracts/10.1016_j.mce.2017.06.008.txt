Bone is a dynamic tissue that is strongly influenced by endocrine factors to restore the balance between bone resorption and bone formation. Bone formation involves the mineralization of the extracellular matrix formed by osteoblasts. In this process the role of vitamin D (1Î±,25(OH)2D3) is both direct and indirect. The direct effects are enabled via the Vitamin D Receptor (VDR); the outcome is dependent on the presence of other factors as well as origin of the osteoblasts, treatment procedures and species differences. Vitamin D stimulates mineralization of human osteoblasts but is often found inhibitory for mineralization of murine osteoblasts.
                  In this review we will overview the current knowledge of the role of the vitamin D endocrine system in controlling the mineralization process in bone.
