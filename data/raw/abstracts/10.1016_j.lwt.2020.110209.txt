Minerals such as calcium, zinc, iron and copper are of great significance for human health, and deficiencies of minerals can lead to various diseases. Currently, the absorption rate and bioavailability of some mineral supplements are relatively low. Mineral-chelating peptides (MCPs) are characterized by high bioavailability, rapid absorption and potent bioactivity. A large amount of by-products including bone, skin, scale and fin are generated during fish processing. They are abundant in collagen, which can serve as a good raw material for the production of MCPs. In this review, preparation methods, evaluation assays, structure-activity relationship, bioactivity and bioavailability of MCPs are systematically reviewed. This article reveals the opportunity to utilize MCPs derived from fish collagen as high value-added mineral supplements.
