Biomimetic mineralization emphasizes reversing the process of dental caries through bio-inspired strategies, in which mineralization promotion and collagen protection are equally important. In this study, carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) was deemed as an analog of glycosaminoglycan for biomimetic modification of collagen, both of the mineralization facilitation and collagen protection effect were evaluated. Experiments were carried out simultaneously on two-dimensional monolayer reconstituted collagen model, three-dimensional reconstituted collagen model and demineralized dentin model. In three models, CMC was successfully cross-linked onto collagen utilizing biocompatible 1-Ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxy sulfosuccinimide sodium salt to achieve biomodification. Results showed that CMC biomodification increased collagen's hydrophilicity, calcium absorption capacity and thermal degradation resistance. In demineralized dentin model, the activity of endogenous matrix metalloproteinases was significantly inhibited by CMC biomodification. Furthermore, CMC biomodification significantly improved cross-linking and intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen, especially in the two-dimensional monolayer reconstituted collagen model. This study provided a biomimetic mineralization strategy with comprehensive consideration of collagen protection, and enriched the application of chitosan-based materials in dentistry.
