Low grade dumped limestone sample having high silica of 8.1%, 36.8% CaO, and 3% Al2O3 has been studied with the aim to reduce the silica level to below 3% for its utilization in iron making. Beneficiation study of the sample was initiated with desliming of the feed sample of −100 µm to remove the siliceous ultrafine particles and to improve the feed quality. Flotation study was carried out by column flotation technique varying the collector dosage, superficial air flow velocity and froth depth to assess their effect on silica reduction and CaO recovery. It was observed that increased collector dosage and superficial air velocity increases the recovery of CaO, and increase in the froth depth reduces the mass flow and silica content in the concentrate. The best result was found at 1.25 cm/sec superficial air velocity, 25 cm froth depth, 1.25 kgpt collector dosage and concentrate assayed 47.3% CaO, 2.8% silica with 72% CaO recovery.
