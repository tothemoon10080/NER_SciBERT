The feasibility of using fly ash, blast furnace slag, silica fume, and CaCO3-TiO2 composite and seashell powders as mineral admixtures in fair-faced concrete is investigated. A series of mix proportions were designed based on an orthogonal method. The effects of different mineral admixtures on the strength, durability and appearance properties were assessed by compressive strength, rapid chloride migration and grey-scale value tests, respectively. The results have shown that compressive strength is affected most by the content of seashell powder. Regarding chloride migration coefficient, blast furnace slag presents the most robust effect. Fly ash has the greatest influence on the grey-scale values at 180 d. Excessive seashell powder would lead to substantial decline in overall performance of fair-faced concrete.
