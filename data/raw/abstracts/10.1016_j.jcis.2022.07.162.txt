Peroxymonosulfate-based advanced oxidation processes (PMS-AOPs) are effective methods for the degradation of highly toxic and refractory nitrogen-containing heteroatomic pollutants such as benzotriazole (BTA). The construction of catalytic materials with multiple active centers is the key to generating abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS) and achieving high mineralization efficiency in PMS-AOPs. Herein, carbon nanotubes-intercalated cobalt copper bimetallic oxide nanosheets catalyst (CoCuNS@CNTs) was obtained by pyrolysis of two-dimensional (2D) MOF precursor. The degradation rate constant of BTA in CoCuNS@CNTs/PMS system was 4 times higher than that of metal oxide nanosheets catalyst without CNTs, while exhibiting high cycling stability and mineralization efficiency. Serial characterizations demonstrated that CoCu nanosheets was formed by CNTs-induced the directional assembly of metal oxide nanoparticles, which had high graphitization and abundant oxygen vacancies and could greatly facilitated the adsorption and electron transfer between the catalyst, PMS and BTA. Moreover, the doping of Cu species significantly improved PMS utilization and accelerated the Co(III)/Co(II) redox cycle. Both radicals (SO4–• and •OH) and non-radicals (1O2) played a role in CuCoNS@CNTs/PMS system and the contributions of ROS were 72.2%, 11.1% and 16.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, the concentration of key ROS (SO4

                     ) production increased from 4.76 μM to 8.56 μM compared with cobalt oxide nanosheets (CoNS). Three degradation pathways of BTA were proposed: benzene ring opening, benzene ring hydroxylation and triazole ring dimerization. Finally, the toxicity changes during the degradation process were measured and the toxicity of eleven intermediates was evaluated. This study may provide new insights into the degradation of persistent organic pollutants.
