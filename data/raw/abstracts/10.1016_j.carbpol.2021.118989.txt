Ulomoides dermestoides (UL) are macroinvertebrates insects belonging to Tenebrionidae Coleopteran family. They were used to hasten, in five days, the biodegradation-mineralization of thermoplastic starch (TPS)-poly(lactic acid) (PLA) films, otherwise biodegradable under composting conditions. After the contact of TPS-PLA film with UL for five days, TPS was metabolized and PLA was hydrolysed, as evidenced by decreasing of hydroxyl and carbonyl group peaks intensity by FTIR spectra, increasing of 13% of PLA crystallinity by DSC thermograms, reduction of PLA and TPS thermal stability by TGA analysis; faecal residues evidenced two glass transition temperature Tg, at 33 °C and 57 °C, associated with depolymerized TPS and PLA, respectively. SEM micrographs highlighted consumption of TPS-PLA surface, while GPC analysis showed a decrease in PLA concentration by 20% during contact by UL. Mineralization tests evidenced UL boosted effect on TPS biodigestion-biodegradation (80%) and PLA biodisintegration (50%), envisaging a challenging perspective for end-life management of bioplastics in environmental conditions.
