The composition of ‘indicator’ minerals is thought to provide a guide to the potential of magmatic arc systems to form porphyry Cu deposits, but whether this is also the case for endoskarn- and exoskarn-dominated systems remains unclear, despite their importance as a source of Cu, Fe and Au. In a first step to address this, we compare the texture, cathodoluminescence (CL) colour and composition of apatite between relatively fresh quartz monzodiorite (QMD) and porphyry-type-, endoskarn- and Fe-(Cu)-mineralised exoskarn components of the Tonglushan porphyry-skarn system of the Daye ore district, China. In the relatively fresh QMD, apatite luminesces yellow-green due to elevated Mn contents. However, where affected by potassic-sodic alteration, it shows green–blue CL thought to reflect partial removal of Mn and an associated increase in REE. Apatite in the endoskarn is more pervasively replaced and veined, and shows mid-blue luminescence due to relatively low Mn, Mg and Cl. The exoskarns contain apatite with variable grain shapes and navy blue-violet or bright to dark blue CL colours, caused by low Mn and elevated Ce, and with only small patches of pale yellow-green CL. Apatite is near absent in the limestone wall rocks and xenoliths and, therefore, where present in the exoskarns is interpreted to have precipitated from the same fluids as the Fe-(Cu) mineralization.
                  Apatite CL colour and chemistry is indicative of the different styles of alteration and mineralisation in the Tonglushan system and provides insights into the composition of skarn-forming fluids. Our results offer a potentially effective method for utilising apatite as a porphyry and skarn deposit indicator mineral in a range of exploration materials including regolith and stream sediments.
