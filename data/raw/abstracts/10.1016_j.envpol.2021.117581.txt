While bioremediation using soil microorganisms is considered an energy-efficient and eco-friendly approach to treat polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-contaminated soils, a variety of polar PAH metabolites, particularly oxygenated ones, could increase the toxicity of the soil after biodegradation. In this study, a typical bio-oxidative transformation of PAH into quinones was investigated in soil amended with laccase using three PAHs with different structures (anthracene, benzo[a]anthracene, and benzo[a]pyrene) to assess the toxicity after oxidative bioremediation. The results show that during a 2-month incubation period the oxidation process promoted the formation of non-extractable residues (NERs) of PAHs, and different effects on mineralization were observed among the three PAHs. Oxidation enhanced the mineralization of the high-molecular-weight (HMW) PAHs (benzo[a]anthracene and benzo[a]pyrene) but inhibited the mineralization of the low-molecular-weight (LMW) PAH (anthracene). The inhibition of anthracene suggests increased toxicity after oxidative bioremediation, which coincided with a decrease in soil nitrification activity, bacterial diversity and PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase gene copies. The analysis of PAH metabolites in soil extract indicated that oxidation by laccase was competitive with the natural transformation processes of PAHs and revealed that intermediates other than quinone metabolites increased the toxicity of soil during subsequent degradation. The different metabolic profiles of the three PAHs indicated that the toxicity of soil after PAH oxidation by laccase was strongly affected by the PAH structure. Despite the potential increase in toxicity, the results suggest that oxidative bioremediation is still an eco-friendly method for the treatment of HMW PAHs since the intermediates from HMW PAHs are more easily detoxified via NER formation than LMW PAHs.
