Radionuclides, specifically 210Pb, can be recovered to copper concentrates potentially by associating with copper sulphide surfaces. This presents regulatory and health issues around radionuclide activity in concentrates. It is hypothesised that 210Pb forms a stable PbS species on the copper sulphide surfaces allowing 210Pb to be “carried” through the flotation process. It is the presence of such a species that this paper seeks to confirm. The minerals examined in this study are chalcocite (Cu2S), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) and pyrite (FeS2) with lead nitrate providing Pb2+ to simulate 210Pb. Thermodynamic modelling and Cyclic Voltammetry studies indicate that PbS does form on the mineral surfaces with Cryogenic X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy confirming its presence. The mechanism of PbS formation is via the adsorption of Pb2+ to sulphur-rich regions on the mineral surfaces and subsequent reaction to form PbS. Various oxygen-associated lead species were also detected, forming via the interaction of Pb2+ with mineral oxidation products. Total lead on the mineral surfaces was 9.69 at%, 19.62 at% and 12.62 at% for pyrite, chalcocite and chalcopyrite, respectively. The ratio of lead-sulphur species to lead-oxygen species was 0.27, 0.84 and 1.00 for pyrite, chalcocite and chalcopyrite, respectively. Under flotation conditions, PbS is a stable species, meaning that it likely remains on mineral surfaces throughout the flotation process, facilitating 210Pb recovery to concentrates.
