Self-compacting concrete (SCC) mixtures requires a large amount of Portland cement and thus resulting in high CO2 emissions, expanding its application has been in question to environment sustainability. Accordingly, environmental-friendly alternatives to Portland cement in SCC mixtures are deemed necessary for the progress of SCC in construction. In this investigation, treated jute fibers and mineral powders were used to replace cement in SCC mixtures. The effects of fibers and powder contents, fiber treatment, and mineral powder types on the workability and mechanical properties of SCC mixtures were investigated through slump-flow, compressive, and flexural tests. A microstructure was conducted through scanning electron microscopy. It was concluded that mineral powders and jute fibers could significantly improve the workability and mechanical properties of SCC. The microstructure observations demonstrated that the proposed methods are capable of enhancing the mechanical properties of SCC with an optimum fiber content. Specifically, a combination of 0.1% jute fibers and 75 μm zeolite powders were found to achieve the best mechanical properties. The relevant results supply fundamental reference and background for artificial intelligence and multi-function development for future infrastructure.
