The in situ high-sensitivity multielement detection capability of PIXE, combined with Î¼m spatial resolution opens up new possibilities in mineral-related research. Trace element data obtained using the proton microprobe provide new tools in exploration for diamond and precious metals, ore genesis studies as well as in the processing of precious-metal-bearing ores. Introduction of this new methodology to the minerals industry however is controlled by economic factors which must be taken into consideration.
