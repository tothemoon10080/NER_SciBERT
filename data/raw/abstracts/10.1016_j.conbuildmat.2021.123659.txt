The main purpose of this paper was to investigate the influence of different liquid accelerators (AR, liquid accelerator based on sodium aluminate; AS, liquid accelerator based on aluminum sulfate; AF, liquid accelerator based on fluoroaluminate) and mineral admixtures (fly ash, slag and silica fume) on the setting time of cement pastes and compressive strength of mortar. In addition, the early hydration process of cement pastes with different mineral admixtures in the presence of AR, AS and AF was explored by isothermal calorimetry, and the crystals composition and micro morphology of hydration products were analyzed by XRD and SEM. The results indicated that in the presence of 7.0% AF, the initial and final setting time of cement pastes with 10% and 5% silica fume are 0.67 min and 1.47 min, respectively. In the presence of 4.0% AR, the mortar with 10% silica fume reaches the highest value of 16.8 MPa. In addition, when the dosages of AF and silica fume are 7.0% and 10%, the first exothermic peak value of paste is 87.79 mW/g. Furthermore, in the presence of liquid accelerators, different mineral admixtures also have great influence on the morphology and crystals composition of hydration products.
