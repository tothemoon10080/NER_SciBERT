Minerals including calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, and copper have several human nutritional functions due to their metabolic activities. Body tissues require sufficient levels of a variety of micronutrients to maintain their health. To achieve these micronutrient needs, dietary consumption must be adequate. Dietary proteins may regulate the biological functions of the body in addition to acting as nutrients. Some peptides encoded in the native protein sequences are primarily responsible for the absorption and bioavailability of minerals in physiological functions. Metal-binding peptides (MBPs) were discovered as potential agents for mineral supplements. Nevertheless, sufficient studies on how MBPs affect the biological functions of minerals are lacking. The hypothesis is that the absorption and bioavailability of minerals are significantly influenced by peptides, and these properties are further enhanced by the configuration and attribute of the metal-peptide complex. In this review, the production of MBPs is discussed using various key parameters such as the protein sources and amino acid residues, enzymatic hydrolysis, purification, sequencing and synthesis and in silico analysis of MBPs. The mechanisms of metal-peptide complexes as functional food ingredients are elucidated, including metal-peptide ratio, precursors and ligands, complexation reaction, absorbability and bioavailability. Finally, the characteristics and application of different metal-peptide complexes are also described.
