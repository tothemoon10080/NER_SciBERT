This chapter summarizes the fundamentals of the technology and gives an overview of the first large-scale application of BaSO4-forming solutions to immobilize contaminants in the former Koenigstein uranium mine of Wismut GmbH company (Germany). The technology of sealing and immobilization by directed crystallization processes can find many applications, both to solve geotechnical tasks and to remediate contaminated areas. Different technologies, such as spraying, penetration grouting, pressure grouting, infiltration from ponds or reservoirs, can be used to transport the mineral-forming solutions into the area that has to be treated. The simple preparation of the solutions can be performed both on the surface and under conditions typical for underground mining. All grout or penetration agents are pure solutions with a viscosity similar or equal to natural groundwater. Good penetration or infiltration even occurs with soils of low permeability. The first large-scale applications have demonstrated successful implantation of the technology for immobilizing contaminants and for sealing porous formations.
