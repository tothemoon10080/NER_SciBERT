The associated minerals make coal middlings possess a relatively high ash content. Subsequent liberation through size reduction can cause recovery increase. However, effect of comminution facilities on mineral liberation of middlings was ignored. This paper studied the liberation characteristics of middlings crushed with different kinds of fragmentation forces. Middlings of −3mm+0.5mm sampled from a dense medium cyclone were comminuted by a jaw crusher and a ball mill to −0.5mm with similar size distribution respectively. The generating mechanism of fines was also analyzed. Full densimetric analyses indicate that mineral liberation of the product crushed by the jaw crusher is better than that by the ball mill at each fraction. For sizes of −0.125mm+0.074mm and −0.074mm, yields of the product with ash content 11% comminuted by jaw crusher are nearly 20% higher than that by the ball mill. Sectional micrographs observed by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) also show the same law for these two fractions and some intergrowth particles still exist in the fraction of −0.5mm+0.25mm.
