2,6-Di-tert-butyl-hydroxytotulene (BHT) is an additive commonly used in the manufacturing of lubricants to improve their antioxidant properties. However, in this study, we found that BHT affects the biodegradation of bio-lubricants by influencing the microbial community during the degradation of bio-lubricants. Specifically, BHT was found to reduce bacterial richness in activated sludge, but it increased the relative abundance of Actinobacteria (from 21.24% to 40.89%), Rhodococcus (from 17.15% to 31.25%), Dietzia (from 0.069% to 6.49%), and Aequorivita (from 0.90% to 1.85%). LEfSe analysis and co-occurrence network analysis suggested that Actinobacteria could be potential biomarkers and keystone taxa in microbial communities. Using the MetaCyc pathway database, the study found that BHT interfered with cellular biosynthetic processes. Additionally, the study also showed that mineral-lubricant base oils, which are difficult to degrade, significantly altered the diversity and composition of the microbiome. Overall, the findings demonstrate that BHT and mineral-lubricant base oils can substantially alter bacterial richness, structure, and function, potentially contributing to the difficulty in degrading lubricants. These findings have implications for the development of more biodegradable lubricants and the management of industrial waste containing lubricants.
