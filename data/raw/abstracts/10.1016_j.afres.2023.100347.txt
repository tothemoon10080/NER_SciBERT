Mineral composition of plants is influenced by the growing environment, plant genetics and management practices. This affects claims about nutritional value of food plants. This review attempts to highlight the various factors associated with absorption of mineral nutrients by plants. Influences of soil factors which can be physical, chemical, and biological are identified. Environmental factors such as temperature, seasonality, and CO2 levels as well as plant factors such as genetics, variety, root architecture, stage of growth etc. affect absorption of mineral nutrients. The role of agronomy in the form of fertilizer inputs, irrigation, plant densities etc. is also a significant factor in the availability and absorption of mineral nutrients. The practical significance of such a critical review of mineral absorption arises due to its implications for health and nutrition and the various claims made for nutritional value and dietary interventions. It is also of value to food producers to ensure that their produce meets the expectations of consumers who rely on such foods for diet and wellbeing. The topic is also of significant national and global importance for food policy and nutrition planning.
