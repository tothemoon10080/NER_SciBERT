This study aims to evaluate the use of two biochars obtained by pyrolysis of sugarcane-bagasse and compare it with commercial activated carbons as catalysts for the recovery of metals from one mining waste from sulfide minerals flotation (MW). It is also intended to determine the influence of carbon materials on the toxicity of the final residues. Leaching tests were performed in 250 mL erlenmeyer flasks using plates with magnetic stirrers during 24 h, at 90 °C and a stirring speed of 350 rpm. For each test, 5 g of MW were mixed with carbon material in two ratios of MW/carbon material (1/0.1 and 1/0.2 wt/wt) and 100 mL of leaching agent (H2SO4 solution at pH = 0.8–0.9 and 5 gL−1 of Fe3+). The experimental results showed that the addition of biochar and activated carbon enhances the recovery of Cu and Zn. The use of commercial activated carbons in ratios of 1/0.1 and 1/0.2 MW/carbon material leads to the extraction of more than 91 % of Cu and 97 % of Zn, after 24 h of leaching. For biochars, the highest recovery values of Cu (82.9 %) and Zn (98.1 %) were achieved with biochar prepared at 750 °C and used in the ratio of 1/0.2. However, the addition of carbon materials does not improve the recovery of Co. The presence of carbon materials decreased the electrical conductivity and pH of the final residue. The leaching of samples MW + W35 (1/0.1) and MW + BC550 (1/0.1) leads to a germination index higher than 90 %. For two biochars, all samples showed non-phytotoxicity.
