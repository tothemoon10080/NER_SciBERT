Critical minerals will play a vital role in the energy transition. In South East Asia like in other regions across the world, there will be an additional advantage in that critical mineral development can contribute to an economic recovery and in time a green economic recovery. This article explores the role of justice in critical mineral development in the South East Asian region with a specific focus on Indonesia. The recent literature on critical minerals has a very limited focus on the role of justice in critical mineral development and this is even more so the case for South East Asian countries. This article provides a first account, utilising the JUST framework to explore, assess and quantitatively examine justice in the critical minerals industry in South East Asia and in particular, Indonesia. If the South East Asian region is to have a green economic recovery, there has to be a focus on achieving justice and reducing unjust outcomes. Indonesia provides strong examples for the potential of the industry and the development of policy to ensure justice, yet, it presents lessons for other South East Asian countries of the pitfalls in such ambition.
