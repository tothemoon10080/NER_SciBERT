The divalent cations in sewage can act as adhesion agents for anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB) and form mineralized granules, thus affecting granular characteristics. The differences of characteristics between non-mineralized and mineralized anammox granules are not tapped, although extensive research have been conducted on anammox granule. This is the first work to systematically compare the detailed differences between non-mineralized (Rc) and mineralized anammox systems (Re) in terms of physicochemical, rheological properties and microbial community under identical operating conditions. Results showed that the mineralized anammox granule with “egg-box” structure was formed with excellent settleability, micro-granular diameter, higher biomass retention and superior mechanical strength compared with non-mineralized granules. The long-term operation results manifested nitrogen removal rates of over 0.8 kg N/m3/d have been stably obtained in both systems due to symbiotic mechanism between Ca.Brocadia and Denitratisoma. Further, the higher polysaccharide concentrations were combined with Ca2+ to promote bacterial aggregation without affecting the specific anammox activity. Additionally, Ca. Jettenia might secrete sec-dependent secretory proteins, which served as the colonizers to promote the initial adhesion of AnAOB on the hydroxyapatite surface. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization confirmed AnAOB was predominantly distributed in the outer layer of granules. Overall, these findings elucidate the proper control strategy to avoid sludge floatation and promote the fluidization of anammox granules in continuous stirred tank reactors.
