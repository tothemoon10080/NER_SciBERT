The utilization of Ca ion as assistant depressant of CMC on talc has been widely reported. Thus, the study on the adsorption mechanism of Ca ion on talc surface is very crucial for understanding the performance of CMC on talc depression. In this paper, mechanism insights into hydrated Ca ion adsorption on talc (001) basal surface were creatively provided using DFT calculation. [Ca(H2O)6]2+ and [Ca(OH)(H2O)3]+ were determined as the effective hydrate components for Ca ion adsorption, and the top O site was the most favorable position for their adsorptions on talc surface. Furthermore, the adsorption mechanisms of [Ca(H2O)6]2+ and [Ca(OH)(H2O)3]+ on talc surface were found to be not the Caâ€”O chemical bond, but the hydrogen bonding formed by the H atom of the H2O ligand and the surface O atom. H2O acted like a bridge to connect them to the talc surface. Moreover, the hydrogen bonding was formed due to the hybridization of H 1s orbital with the O 2s, O 2p orbitals. Simultaneously, electrons transferred between the H atom and the surface O atom. This work provides theoretical insights into the Ca ion adsorption on talc surface, which can help deeply understand the talc flotation using CMC as depression.
