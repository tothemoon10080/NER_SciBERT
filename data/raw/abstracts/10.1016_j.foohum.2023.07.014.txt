In this study, the effect of roasting in microwave and oven on selected constituents, bioactive properties, fatty acid compositions, polyphenol and mineral contents of Chestnuts (Cestanea sativa Milles) grown in Bursa in Turkey was investigated. The oil contents of Chestnut fruits are defined between 0.85 (control) and 3.30% (microwave). While antioxidant results of Chestnut roasted change between 68.07 (microwave) and 70.03% (oven), total phenolic amounts of Chestnut extracts roasted varied between 74.65 (control) and 129.10 mgGAE/100 g (oven). Gallic acid and 3,4-dihydroxy benzoic acid contents of Chestnut roasted were recorded between 9.55 (control) and 21.79 mg/100 g (microwave) to 2.93 (control) and 11.47 mg/100 g (microwave), respectively. Oleic and linoleic acid contens of unroasted and roasted chestnut oils were reported between 35.40 (microwave) and 38.91% (oven) to 39.02 (control) and 43.22% (microwave), respectively. The Ca and K amounts of unroasted and roasted Chestnut samples changed betweeen 770.40 (oven) and 1156.30 mg/kg (microwave) to 7436.01 (control) and 7947.72 mg/kg (microwave), respectively. In general, while oven roasting is recommended for bioactive components of Chestnuts, microwave roasting is recommended for phenolic components and minerals.
