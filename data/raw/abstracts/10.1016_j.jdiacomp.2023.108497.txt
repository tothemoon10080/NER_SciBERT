Diabetes mellitus (DM) and arterial hypertension are considered serious public health problems. Several studies have shown that oxidative stress is usually related to the onset of DM and hypertension, as well their associated complications. Moreover, the levels of some minerals are closely related to the pathophysiology of these diseases. Thus, in this study we aimed to evaluate the effect of metformin on the redox profile and mineral levels in the serum of patients with DM type 2 and hypertension. We also tested the effect of metformin on the viability and redox profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for 24Â h. As expected, we found that patients with type 2 DM and hypertension + type 2 DM had higher fasting glucose and triglyceride levels. As groundbreaking research, we found that both patients DM type 2 and Hypertension + DM type 2 had reduced myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. On the other hand, the levels of total thiols (PSH) and vitamin C were increased. There was no statistical significance for the alterations in mineral levels. In addition, metformin treatment had no cytotoxic effect on PBMCs. Similarly, in patients of both groups, MPO activity was reduced and PSH levels were increased in PBMCs. We have shown that metformin is a drug with a protective effect in patients with DM type 2 against oxidative stress by reducing MPO activity and improving the levels of PSH and antioxidant defenders such as vitamin C. The results of in vitro assays support the antioxidant effect of metformin. Furthermore, we suggest studies to assess the biochemical mechanisms of metformin and how it can be used in a pharmacological therapeutic perspective against oxidative damage.
