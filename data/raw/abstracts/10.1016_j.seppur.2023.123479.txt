Typical mine tailings can be dewatered by filter press to filter cakes containing >=85 wt% solids that are ready for reclamation, but Alberta oil sands tailings could only reach about 60 wt% solids using the same technology, even when the dominant particle sizes are similar. In this work, the effects of residual bitumen, one of the distinguishing features of oil sands tailings, were investigated. The residual bitumen in the oil sands tailings exists in the forms of bulk bitumen, emulsified bitumen, and adsorbed bitumen. The roles of the three forms of bitumen were investigated in the filtration of primarily a model mineral kaolinite mineral slurry supplemented by rutile, quartz and montmorillonite slurries. Generally, bulk bitumen was found not to affect filtration significantly, emulsified bitumen facilitated filtration possibly by mopping the ultrafine particles, while bitumen adsorbed on mineral surfaces had more complex effects: a thin bitumen coating improved filtration because of the induced surface hydrophobicity, while a thick bitumen coating impeded filtration due to its mobile and deformable nature. The poor filterability of oil sands tailings may be partly caused by the mobile and deformable bitumen coating on the sands/clay mineral surfaces. This study elucidated the effects of a third deformable organic phase on the filtration of an aqueous mineral slurry, providing insights for solid–liquid separation in the presence of a mobile third phase.
