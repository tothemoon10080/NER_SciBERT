Based on the elastic plate theory, a mechanical model of thin plate for the first caving of overlying roof rock in steep mining face was established. The analytical solution of the deflection and stress distribution of roof rocks was obtained. According to the specific geological conditions of the 5-103 panel in Shanxi, the failure of roof rocks and the influence of seam dip on it during the exploitation were theoretically investigated. Meanwhile, the first caving characteristics of the overlying rock in the steep coal seam were investigated based on its stress contour. The results show that the dip angle has a distinct influence on the caving interval and the first caving interval for the 5-103 panel is 37m in theory. Finally, a systematic monitoring on the behavior of rock pressures was conducted. The measured results agree well with the theoretical prediction, which provides a good reference for practical steep coal seam mining.
