Ammonia is a useful modifier for enhancing surface sulfurization in copper oxide ore flotation using xanthate as a collector. However, its potential role in the reaction of sulfhydryl collector with sulfurized copper oxide mineral in a complex pulp has been neglected. This work investigates the contribution of ammonia to xanthate adsorption on the sulfurized malachite surface, independent of its effect on sulfurization. Zeta potential measurements indicate that NH3·H2O increases the surface potential of malachite and enhances the proximity of xanthate to the malachite surface in a strong-alkaline solution. Adsorption tests and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis demonstrate that NH3·H2O can increase the xanthate adsorption density. Spectroscopic analysis reveals copper(I) xanthate and dixanthogen as the primary xanthate products, with their quantities increasing upon NH3·H2O treatment. Thermodynamic analysis of the reaction of malachite, HS−, and xanthate to form copper(I) xanthate and dixanthogen shows that NH3·H2O treatment enhances the stability of the reaction compared to its absence. Thus, NH3·H2O treatment increased the recovery of sulfurized malachite by over 10%. This study offers a comprehensive understanding of ammonia modification for enhancing sulfurization–xanthate flotation of copper oxide minerals and provides a scientific basis for developing high-efficiency collectors.
