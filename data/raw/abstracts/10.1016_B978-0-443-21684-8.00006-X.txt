Several researchers have sought to explain the heterogeneous distribution of individual or groups of mineral deposits through time in terms of the tectonic evolution of the Earth. As discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, rather than considering mineral deposits, there has been increasing attention on the concept of mineral systems as a more systematic and holistic approach for defining the critical parameters that control their distribution. The background for the evolution of global metallogenic provinces from the Archean to early Paleoproterozoic is provided here in terms of the nature of tectonics on a hotter early Precambrian Earth. This includes (1) the nature of the mantle and episodic mantle overturns; (2) the evolution of plate tectonics; and (3) the formation of cratons with their thick buoyant mantle lithosphere. This is followed by a discussion of the supercontinent cycle.
