To improve the catalytic activity of photothermal catalysts for efficient mineralization of volatile organic compounds still keeps challenge. Herein, ZnMn2O4 with controllably exposed {010} facets (ZMO-H), {11−1} facets (ZMO-R), and {1−1−1} facets (ZMO-C) were firstly synthesized and used to unveil an essential role of facet-dependent activation of surface lattice oxygen for toluene mineralization under full-spectrum light irradiation. The experimental studies and theoretical calculations together evidenced that as compared to ZMO-R and ZMO-C, ZMO-H is favorable for activating surface lattice oxygen, owing to its relatively stronger light absorption, higher surface lattice oxygen content, and lower oxygen dissociation energy. The theoretical calculations further confirmed that toluene is more easily adsorbed by ZMO-H than by ZMO-R and ZMO-C. All these advantages have substantially afforded the toluene photothermal oxidation activity of ZMO-H. This finding confirms that surface lattice oxygen activation of catalyst by facet engineering is crucial on the photothermal oxidation of toluene.
