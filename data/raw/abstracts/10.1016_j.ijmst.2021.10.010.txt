In this investigation, a chelating agent of amino trimethylene phosphonic acid (ATMP) was introduced to eliminate the adverse effect of seawater in molybdenite flotation. Microflotation results presented that high flotation recovery of molybdenite was achieved in freshwater using kerosene as the collector, but it was significantly decreased in the presence of seawater when pH > 9.5. Among the main ions in seawater, magnesium and calcium ions played a more detrimental role than others. After the addition of ATMP, molybdenite floatability can restore in seawater. Zeta potential distribution and solution chemistry calculation results illustrated that the decreased molybdenite floatability was attributed to the interaction of positive Mg(OH)2(s) (major) and CaOH+ (minor) components with the molybdenite surface. The magnesium/calcium ions of positive components of Mg(OH)2(s) and CaOH+ interacted with the ionized species of ATMP and then produced ATMP-calcium/magnesium complex, leading to the electrostatic repulsion between molybdenite and ATMP-calcium/magnesium complex that was restoring the molybdenite flotation. Hence, the ATMP can be utilized as an appropriate reagent to improve molybdenite flotation in seawater.
