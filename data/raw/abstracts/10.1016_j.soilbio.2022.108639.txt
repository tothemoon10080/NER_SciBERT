Magnetically responsive minerals were isolated from soil samples using a strong permanent magnet. The isolated materials exhibited peroxidase-like activity using N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate salt as a substrate. Autoclaving and hot air treatment at 200 °C did not substantially decreased the enzyme-like activity; on the contrary thermal treatment many times caused an increase of peroxidase-like activity. Peroxidase activity measured in soil suspensions is thus due to both the enzymes (peroxidases) of microbial, plant and animal origin, and the inorganic peroxidase-mimetic minerals. We define a new research area called “soil nanozymology” devoted to study of soil-related nanozymes and other enzyme-mimetic materials.
