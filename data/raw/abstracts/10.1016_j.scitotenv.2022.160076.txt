Acid mine drainage (AMD) threatens the water quality and safety of karst river water (KRW), and the formation of secondary iron or aluminum-bearing minerals during the mixing of AMD with KRW plays a crucial role in the migration of elements. However, the variations in the mineralogical, morphological and elemental compositions of secondary minerals and their influences on the migration of elements during AMD–KRW mixing have not been systematically studied. In this study, we mixed different proportions of AMD and KRW in a laboratory experiment to simulate seasonal hydrological conditions in a river to understand the major and trace elemental distributions in the mixed water and in precipitates and we discuss the formation process for the secondary minerals. The results showed that AMD can lead to a decrease in pH and DO and an increase in heavy metals and rare earth elements (REEs) in KRW. With the biological or chemical oxidation of Fe2+, Fe3+ combines with SO4
                     2− to form schwertmannite or hydrolyzes to form Fe(OH)3(s) and FeOOH(s), accompanied by the formation of amorphous Al hydroxide, resulting in a decrease in pH and an increase in Eh. Schwertmannite had strong adsorption and coprecipitation effects on Mn, Cr, Cu and As, so the adsorption and coprecipitation effects of schwertmannite on REEs were inhibited, while the migration of REEs were mainly affected by Al hydroxides. Therefore, after the AMD mixes with KRW, it not only causes severe water and sediment pollution but also adsorbs and enriches high concentrations of heavy metals in the secondary minerals formed during the mixing process, creating a major ecological hazard that requires further attention.
