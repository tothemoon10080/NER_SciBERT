Schizophyllum commune Fr. is a wild macro fungus species, which is often used as a food source by the indigenous Kaili tribe along the Palu-Koro fault, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. This fungus has a wide variety in terms of the weathered wood substrate as a place to grow and is found in almost all types of ecosystems. Although its diversity has been investigated, there is no identification of the weathered wood type as a substrate for growth. Some communities in Indonesia have not also known its potential and benefits. Therefore, this research aims to determine the wood type that grows S. commune fungus, ethnomycology, mineral composition, proximate, and phytochemical compounds. It was carried out using the descriptive explanatory approach and the fungi location as well as wood substrate sampling, was determined through the purposive sampling technique in forest areas, agroforestry, and community gardens along the Palu-Koro fault, Central Sulawesi. The samples of unknown wood types were through the collection of tree parts, namely twigs, leaves, flowers, and fruits, which were brought to Herbarium Celebense, Tadulako University for identification. Analysis of mineral content, proximate, and fungal phytochemical compounds was carried out based on the method according to the existing protocol. The results showed that 92 types of rotted wood found where the fungus S. commune grew, belonged to 36 families. The nutritional content is also good, although it varies based on the type of wood growing media. Therefore, it can be used and processed into various health-beneficial food products. This showed that domestication of the fungus needs to be carried out to support its commercialization as food and medicine in the future.
