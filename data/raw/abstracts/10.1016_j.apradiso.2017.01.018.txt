An effective process for the oxidation of Methyl Orange dye (MO) was determined by comparing the mineralization efficiency between two advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) viz., ozonolysis and gamma radiolysis in presence and absence of an added inorganic salt potassium persulfate (K2S2O8). The effects of various operating parameters such as ozone flow rate and reaction temperature were optimized to achieve the best possible mineralization extent of MO by ozonolysis. The mineralization efficiency of MO was significantly enhanced during gamma radiolysis in presence of K2S2O8 (γ+K2S2O8) compared to in absence of K2S2O8. The presence of methyl group at the amine of phenyl ring assisted the mineralization of dye during γ+K2S2O8. The oxygen-equivalent chemical-oxidation capacities (OCC) of ozonolysis and γ+K2S2O8 for 75% mineralization of the dye solution were calculated as 7.008 and 0.0336kg equiv. O2 m−3, respectively which signifies that γ+K2S2O8 can be explored as an effective AOP. The non-biodegradable MO dye solution became biodegradable even after the dose of 0.5 kGy during γ+K2S2O8 compared to 1 kGy in absence of K2S2O8. The study concludes that a lower dose γ+K2S2O8 could be one of the efficient pretreatment steps before undergoing biological degradation of dye solution.
