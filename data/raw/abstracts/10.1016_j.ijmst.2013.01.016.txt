The concentration of 39 trace elements in coal from the late Permian taken from the eastern Yunnan-western Guizhou region was determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. It was found that the mean content of Ti, V, Cr, Mo, Co, Ni, Y, and Zr is higher than the national average. The occurrence of Mn, Ni, and Co in the different coalfields is distinctly different. Most of the enriched transition metal elements exist mainly as inorganic minerals. In the Zhina coalfield, Co, Ni, and Nb are primarily associated with sulfur. Mn, Cs, and Mo are mostly sulfides. Almost all Co was organic and a significant part of the Ni is also organic in the Liupanshui coalfield. Cs, Co, and Ni are related to sulfur in the coal taken from eastern Yunnan. Carbonate is the main form of Mn in the coal from eastern Yunnan and the Liupanshui coalfield. Ti is the oxide in the coal samples where Ti is enriched. Zr is in the form of zircon in the samples where Zr is enriched. The situation for most of the transition metal elements is consistent with terrestrial genesis. Coal seams are universally influenced by the sea. The strongly seawater effected peat bog with a reductive and alkaline environment favors the relative enrichment of Mn. A reducing environment is conducive to transition metal element enrichment.
