This study sought to 1) investigate the spatial distribution of mineral density of dog dentin using µ-CT and 2) characterize the relationship between the elastic modulus and mineral density of dog dentin using nanoindentation and µ-CT. Maxillary canine teeth of 10 mature dogs were scanned with a µ-CT then sectioned in the transverse and vertical planes and tested using nanoindentation. Spatial distribution of mineral density and elastic modulus was quantified. Results demonstrated significant spatial variation in mineral density and elastic modulus. Mineral density and elastic modulus generally increased from the dentin-pulp interface to the dentino-enamel junction and from the crown base to the crown tip. Significant site dependent correlations between mineral density and elastic modulus were determined (0.021 > R2 > 0.408). The results of this study suggest that while mineral density is a mediator of elastic modulus, other mediators such as collagen content may contribute to the mechanical behavior of dog dentin.
