The onset of lactation is characterized by substantially altered calcium (Ca) metabolism; recently, emphasis has been placed on understanding the dynamics of blood Ca in the peripartal cow in response to this change. Thus, the aim of our study was to delineate how prepartum dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) diets and the magnitude of Ca decline at the onset of lactation altered blood Ca dynamics in the periparturient cow. Thirty-two multiparous Holstein cows were blocked by parity, previous 305d milk yield and expected parturition date, and randomly allocated to either a positive (+120 mEq/kg; +DCAD) or negative (âˆ’120 mEq/kg; -DCAD) DCAD diet from 251 d of gestation until parturition (n = 16/diet). Immediately after parturition cows were continuously infused for 24 h with i.) an intravenous solution of 10% dextrose or ii.) Ca gluconate (CaGlc) to maintain blood ionized (iCa) concentrations at approximately 1.2 mM (normocalcemia) to form 4 treatment groups (n = 8/treatment). Blood was sampled every 6 h from 102 h before parturition until 96 h post parturition and every 30 min during 24 h continuous infusion. Cows fed a -DCAD diet prepartum exhibited a less pronounced decline in blood iCa approaching parturition with lesser magnitude of decline relative to +DCAD fed cows. Cows fed a -DCAD diet prepartum required lower rates of CaGlc infusion to maintain normocalcemia in the 24 h postpartum relative to +DCAD fed cows. Infusion of CaGlc disrupted blood Ca and P dynamics in the immediate 24 h post-parturition and in the days following infusion. Collectively, these data demonstrate that prepartum -DCAD diets facilitate a more transient hypocalcemia and improve blood Ca profiles at the onset of lactation while CaGlc infusion disrupts mineral metabolism.
