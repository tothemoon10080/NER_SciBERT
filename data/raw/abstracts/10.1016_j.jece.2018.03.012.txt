Gaseous emissions from organic waste treatment processes are substantial contributors to global ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions. Regarding complexity of the waste gas mixture, low concentration levels of the single compounds, and their high odor relevance, non-thermal plasma (NTP) processes are an adequate technique for the treatment of such emissions. However, performance tests of NTPs were mainly carried out with artificial low-volume gas flows and highly experimental plasma catalysts. A combined process of a non-thermal plasma and a readily available low-cost halloysite-containing mineral adsorber for VOCs removal and odor abatement was tested for emission treatment of two organic waste treatment plants. The process revealed average removal rates for VOCs, ammonia, and methane of 62.9 %, 15.9 %, and 30.1 % at the first site and 43.2 %, 22.2 %, and 34.8 % at the second site at specific input energy (SIE) levels of 2.1–2.2 kWh 1000 m−3. Additional odor analysis in the latter case revealed a high potential for odor abatement of 95.9–98.3 % at similar SIE levels.
