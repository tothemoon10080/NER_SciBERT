The ability of microorganisms to reduce iron in clay minerals has been well demonstrated by literature up to now. However, the detailed interaction mechanisms between minerals surface and responsible sites of bacterial appendages remains unclear. The work delves deep into the mechanisms involved in iron reduction from clay minerals, illuminating forces at play such as electrostatic forces and hydrophobic interactions, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and chelating effect of EPS, among others. This work also succinctly synthesize the factors affecting the adhesion of bacteria onto clay surface, as well as the effects of the interaction on the physico-chemical properties of clay minerals and electron transfer mechanisms between microorganisms and minerals. Knowledge gaps in current understanding are identified while future perspectives to bridge the gaps are also outlined including the use of state-of-the-art analysis techniques such as Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), analytical cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (cryo-STEM-EELS) to visualise information at the molecular and nanometer scale.
