Analyzing the relationship between nanotechnology applications, mineral saving, and environmental degradation is important to achieve sustainable development goals. However, in the literature, no study empirically examines the interaction among nanotechnology applications, mineral saving, and environmental degradation. This study addresses this significant gap in the literature by investigating the impacts of nanotechnology applications on mineral saving and the ecological footprint in 9 countries (Australia, Canada, China, France, Japan, Korea, Russia, Sweden, and the USA) in the period 1990â€“2017 using the combined panel fourier fractional cointegration and panel fractional fourier causality test. According to the causality test results based on group statistics, there is a Granger causality from nanotechnology applications to mineral saving. Also, there is causality from mineral saving to ecological footprint. The estimations of the causality based on individual statistics show no causality linkage between nanotechnology applications and mineral saving in the countries, excluding Australia and France. Canada, China, France, and Sweden are countries with unilateral causality from nanotechnology applications to ecological footprint. In the other countries, except China, Japan, and the USA, mineral saving doesn't Granger cause ecological footprint.
                  The long-run findings show a positive impact of nanotechnology applications on mineral saving and ecological footprint. These findings are valid for all countries. In this context, it can be concluded that nanotechnology applications are essential for resource-saving. But, to save resources, the authorities should focus on controlling and measuring nanoparticle emissions.
