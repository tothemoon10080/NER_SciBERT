In this review, it is first attempted to put together the available basic knowledge as relevant to the problem of very fine particles, and secondly to analyse the various surface-based methods. The greater part of this vast literature is of a basic, fundamental nature. An acute need to do more research on the problem of very fine particles from an applied angle is explicit. Considerations of the significance of what has been practically observed with a qualitative theoretical approach may be defined as an applied approach. Such an approach will enable an understanding of why there are lower size limits for various existing processes and a base for further developments.
                  Aggregation of very fine particles by hydrophobic-association, the use of oil as a collector extender in the above, column flotation, and the physical and chemical characterization of the surface composition and heterogeneity are the areas in surface-based methods identified for future research.
