This research delves into the complex interplay between land and electricity prices and sustainable mineral resource development across ten Asian countries characterized by significant pollution levels. Leveraging the CUP-FM (continuously updated full modified) technique from 1995 to 2020, the study uncovers crucial insights. Notably, heightened electricity prices demonstrate a direct association with an elevated ratio of mineral consumption to GDP (Gross Domestic Product), underscoring the role of pricing in optimizing mineral resource utilization. Additionally, a positive correlation between the poverty ratio and mineral consumption underscores that regions grappling with higher poverty levels tend to rely more on mineral consumption for their economic activities. Conversely, a negative link exists between the Consumer Price Index and mineral consumption, indicating how inflation impacts prudent resource consumption. Furthermore, the research reveals a compelling connection wherein increased patent applications coincide with reduced mineral consumption-to-GDP ratios, underscoring the role of innovation. Lastly, population growth exhibits a positive influence on the mineral consumption-to-GDP ratio. To enhance mineral efficiency, practical policy recommendations encompass fostering renewable energy, strategically importing green utilities, supporting green patents, and embracing digital transformation.
