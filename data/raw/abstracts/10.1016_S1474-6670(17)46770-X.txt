Optimal Control techniques are important in Mineral Processing, but they give rise to complex mathematical and statistical properties and due to process noise, benefits may be scanty. This paper presents a new method to simultaneously identify and optimize the control of a process in an iterative way, so as to approach at each iteration the point of optimum. The technique makes use of the theory of Statistical Control and convergence results are proved. Moreover in comminution processes it is shown to be robust and optimal.
