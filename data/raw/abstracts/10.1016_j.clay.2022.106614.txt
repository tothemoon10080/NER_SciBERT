Mycotoxin pollution is a continuous feed and food safety issue, leading to livestock and human health risks and potential secondary environmental pollution. Currently, various methods have been developed to reduce the amount of mycotoxin in feed. Clay minerals are one of the most widely used approaches in the animal industry. Because of the negatively charged, high specific surface area, and high cation exchange capacity, clay minerals have excellent adsorption performance that can affect the transference and transformation of mycotoxins in feed. Depending on the metal ions or oxides they are combined with, a few clay minerals are used for the degradation of mycotoxins in the environment, which can be one of the potential candidates for the removal of mycotoxins to avoid secondary environmental pollution. In this review, we have summarized the adverse effects of mycotoxins on animals and humans and the way mycotoxins circulate in the biological chain, including aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and zearalenone (ZEN). Furthermore, the effects of natural clay minerals and clay mineral-based nanocomposite materials on mycotoxins in ecological chain circulation, including adsorption, degradation, and antifungal, have been described. Finally, the potential for clay mineral materials to be used in animal husbandry and environmental protection is explored.
