The third crucial macronutrient required for the development and growth of plants in addition to nitrogen and phosphorous is potassium. The quantity of soluble potassium in soil that could be directly taken up by plants is less and present in the form of evaporite deposits situated in countries lying in the Northern hemisphere such as Canada, Belarus, Israel, USA and Russia. All other countries are dependent on imports from these countries to fulfil their potash requirement. But a major part of potassium exists in insoluble form as silicate minerals abundantly in these countries which can compensate for the potassium deficit. Mostly feldspar and feldspathoid from the tectosilicate group and micaceous minerals from the phyllosilicate group are the common potassium bearing silicates containing 5â€“15% K2O. Tectosilicates are framework silicates in which potassium is present in the three-dimensional silicate tetrahedra. Phyllosilicates are sheet silicates having a two-dimensional parallel sheet structure and potassium ions are located in the interlayers of the silicate structure. Various processes have been adopted to release the potassium from these silicate resources such as bio-leaching using various algal, bacterial and yeast strains, acid leaching with different acids of varying concentrations, base leaching with diverse strategies and roast-leach studies with alkali and alkaline salts to optimise the recovery. This review summarizes versatile methodologies that have been approached and the scope of various works that could be further accomplished.
