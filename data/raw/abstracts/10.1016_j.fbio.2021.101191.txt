The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of dietary peptide-chelated trace minerals as inorganic mineral substitutes to modulate cellular enzyme activity and improve pork quality. Cross-bred pigs were fed a corn-soy-wheat basal diet without (Con) or with supplementary inorganic (ITM) or organic (OTM) trace minerals (Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, and Se at 125, 22.5, 30, 120, and 0.3 mg/kg, respectively) to investigate the effects on meat quality and storage stability (4 °C). A diet with one-third of the OTM mineral content (OTM1/3) was also tested. Drip loss of ITM and OTM pork was reduced by 27.5% and 50%, respectively, compared to the control. The OTM pork displayed a higher colorimetric L* value throughout storage but a slightly lower a* value during the first 4 days than ITM meat. While both forms of minerals suppressed lipid oxidation (TBARS), OTM was more effective than ITM, corresponding to a higher muscle superoxide dismutase activity. The OTM1/3 diet also produced significant oxidation inhibition, and the effect was comparable to ITM.
