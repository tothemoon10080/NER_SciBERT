A methodology for the selection of the optimal land uses of the reclamation of mined areas is proposed. It takes into consideration several multi-nature criteria and constraints, including spatial constrains related to the permissible land uses in certain parts of the mined area. The methodology combines desirability functions and evolution searching algorithms for selection of the optimal reclamation scheme. Its application for the reclamation planning of the Amynteon lignite surface mine in Greece indicated that it handles effectively spatial and non-spatial constraints and incorporates easily the decision-makers preferences regarding the reclamation strategy in the optimization procedure.
