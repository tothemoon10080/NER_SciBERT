The purpose of this research is to indicate the potential differences in bearing characteristics resulting from the application of different lubricant types with the same viscosity grade. The effect of different environmentally acceptable lubricants (EALs) on hydrodynamic journal bearing properties is studied experimentally and compared to the properties obtained after lubrication with a reference mineral oil. The results of the studies proved that a bearing lubricated with EALs had practically the same properties as one lubricated with mineral oil. The calculations for the tested bearing system showed that the variations of selected lubricant parameters, such as specific heat or thermal conductivity, do not significantly affect the properties of the bearing, i.e. the minimum film thickness or power losses.
