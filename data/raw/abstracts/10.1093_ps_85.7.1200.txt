Three floor pen experiments (Exp) were conducted to evaluate low nonphytin P (NPP) concentrations and the NPP sparing effect of phytase (PHY) and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25D) on bone mineralization, bone breaking during commercial processing, litter P, and water-soluble P (WSP) concentrations. Tested treatments (TRT) were control, National Research Council NPP; University of Maryland (UMD) NPP; UMD + PHY, UMD NPP reduced by 0.064% NPP + 600 U of PHY/kg; UMD + PHY + 25D, UMD NPP reduced by 0.090% NPP + 600 U of PHY and 70 µg of 25D/kg; control + PHY mimicked the industry practice of diets by 0.1% when PHY is added; and negative control with 90% UMD NPP concentrations. UMD + PHY and control + PHY diets contained 600 U of PHY/kg, and UMD + PHY + 25D contained 600 U of PHY + 70 µg of 25D/kg. Performance results were presented separately. After each Exp, litter P and WSP were determined, and bone measurements were obtained on 8 or 10 broilers per pen. Tested TRT did not affect broiler BW. Femur ash weight of broilers fed the UMD and UMD + PHY + 25D was lower in all Exp compared with that of broilers fed the control diet. Femur ash was similar for control and UMD + PHY broilers, yet averaged over all Exp, UMD + PHY broilers consumed 39% less NPP and required less NPP per gram of femur ash than those on the control (4.87 and 7.77 g of NPP/g of ash, Exp 3). At the end of Exp 3, broilers were processed in a commercial facility. Despite reductions in NPP intake and bone mineralization, no differences were observed in measurements of economic importance (parts lost, carcass yield, and incidence of broken bones). The P excretion per bird was lowest for birds fed the UMD + PHY + 25D diet followed by those fed the UMD + PHY and negative control diets (10.44, 12.00, and 13.78 g of P/bird, respectively) and were highest for those fed the control diet (19.55 g of P/bird). These results suggest that feeding diets low in P together with PHY and 25D will not affect performance or increase losses at processing while resulting in improved P retention and reductions in P and WSP excreted.
