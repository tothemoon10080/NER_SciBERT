Through analyzing mine's exploration report, mineral processing report, monitoring reports of beneficiation wastewater and clarified water in tailings reservoir, the paper discusses the migration and distribution regularity of accompanying harmful elements in the copper-bearing skarn mine at the Fengshan in the mineral processing system. After beneficiation of the crude ore, the content of arsenic and lead in one ton of concentrate are so high that they form some of pollutant factors in the subsequent smelting process for concentrate; arsenic, zinc and lead are highly concentrated in the tailings and it would accelerate environmental risk.
