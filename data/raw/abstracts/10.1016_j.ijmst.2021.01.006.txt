Reports on corrosion failure of cable bolts, used in mining and civil industries, have been increasing in the past two decades. The previous studies found that pitting corrosion on the surface of a cable bolt can initiate premature failure of the bolt. In this study, the role of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (A. ferrooxidans) bacterium in the occurrence of pitting corrosion in cable bolts was studied. Stressed coupons, made from the wires of cable bolts, were immersed in testing bottles containing groundwater collected from an underground coal mine and a mixture of A. ferrooxidans and geomaterials. It was observed that A. ferrooxidans caused pitting corrosion on the surface of cable bolts in the near-neutral environment. The presence of geomaterials slightly affected the pH of the environment; however, it did not have any significant influence on the corrosion activity of A. ferrooxidans. This study suggests that the common bacterium A. ferrooxidans found in many underground environments can be a threat to cable boltsâ€™ integrity by creating initiation points for other catastrophic failures such as stress corrosion cracking.
