During the present investigation, carrot flour was studied in terms of mineral profile, proximate composition, bioactive profile and antioxidant potential. Experiments were performed in triplicate and the data reported are a mean of three different carrots flour. Mineral profile indicates the presence of phosphorus (0.21 ± 0.02–0.29 ± 0.07%), potassium (1.14 ± 0.12–2.71 ± 0.15%), calcium (0.1 ± 0.01–0.2 ± 0.04%), zinc (0.0021 ± 0.0001–0.0025 ± 0.0002%), copper (0.0007 ± 0.0001–0.0008 ± 0.0002%), iron (0.0064 ± 0.0003–0.0746 ± 0.0007%) and manganese (0.0008 ± 0.0001–0.0016 ± 0.0003%). Proximate analysis revealed that purple carrot flour possess significant amount of fiber whereas orange carrot flour higher amount of protein. Total phenolic content (TPC) was observed as 13.16 ± 0.09–13.72 ± 0.17 mg GAE/g dwb carrot flour (mg gallic acid equivalent/g dry weight basis of carrot flour) for orange carrot flour followed by 16.89 ± 0.31–18.57 ± 0.46 mg GAE/g dwb for purple carrot flour and 14.59 ± 0.22–15.28 ± 0.26 mg GAE/g dwb for red carrot flour. Minerals, fiber, protein and antioxidant rich carrot flour could be utilized in the preparation of health benefiting fortified food products.
