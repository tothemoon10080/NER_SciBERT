Canastra cheese is a product with an indication of origin and obtained from raw cow milk using endogenous culture (pingo). Since this type of cheese is considered one of the best-known and most consumed artisanal dairy products in Brazil, this study aimed to provide relevant information on its characteristics and evaluate the variability related to the production units and seasons. Thirty-six samples (ripened for 22 days) were produced in winter (n = 18) and summer (n = 18) and analyzed for proximate composition, pH, water activity, mineral content, fatty acid profile, fat health indicators, and texture parameters. Our findings revealed that the season and production units affected the composition and texture properties of the samples due to the fact that pH, Ca, Cu, K, and C4:0, C16:0, C14:1, C16:1, C18:1n-9 t, C18:1n-9c, C18:2n-6c levels were higher in cheese produced in summer, while C6:0, C10:0, C12:0, C14:0, and C18:0 content increased in winter samples. Fat content showed low atherogenic and thrombogenic indexs and high desirable hypocholesterolemic fatty acids, and the resilience was the only texture parameter that did not differ among the samples. The principal component analysis separated the cheese produced in different seasons, making this differentiation clear in all production units. The results provide information for consumers about the characteristics and nutritional composition of these products. In addition, they demonstrated that although it has produced in the same region, these cheeses are heterogeneous and have their peculiarities.
