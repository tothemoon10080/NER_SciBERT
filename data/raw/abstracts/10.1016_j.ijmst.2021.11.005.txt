Persistent froth is becoming more and more common in coal and mineral flotation plants and presents safety and operational challenges. No effective method has been developed to destabilise persistent froth. As a new initiative, this study examined the structural difference between persistent foam and coal froth, based on which a solution was developed to maximumly destabilise coal froth. Destabilisation test, oscillatory rheology measurement and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicated that the coal froth was more stable than the foam due to the formation of thin capillaries and tightly arranged coal particles on bubble surfaces. Although 107 µm silicone oil droplet could completely destabilise the foam at 2 mmol/L concentration, it only destabilised less than 50% coal froth even at 6 mmol/L concentration. To maximumly destabilise the coal froth formed by −38 and −20 µm particles, 24 and 18 µm silicone oil droplets were required to pass through the thin capillaries and enter the bubble films, respectively. However, smaller silicone oil droplets could not bridge the bubble films to destabilise coal froth and therefore a critical droplet size occurred depending on the size of particles stabilising the froth.
