The integrated automation system consisting of two layers: Manufacturing Execution System (MES) and Process Control System (PCS), is developed to overcome the problems of high production cost, high expenditure of resources and serious environmental pollution in minerals processing industry in China because of low automation level. The structure, functions and control strategy of this system are discussed. The system proposed in this paper has been successfully applied to the Minerals Processing Factory of Jiuquan Iron and Steel Company of China, providing process optimal control, process optimal operation and process optimal management. It has been proven to provide benefits to this minerals processing factory.
