Composites development, by incorporating organic or mineral fillers to starch matrices, can be used to improve their final properties. Accordingly, composites of different starch matrices reinforced with organic fillers, as well as, with mineral particles are described in this chapter. In this sense, it was reported, among others, the use of cellulose fibers from different botanical origins and clays particles. Nowadays, both academic and industrial interest in nanoscale fillers is growing since a nanostructured composite could be developed from a polymeric matrix and layered mineral particles. Thus, in this chapter is also included the development of nanocomposites based on thermoplastic starch and talc nanoparticles from different geological origins and morphologies. Processing methods and structural and final properties of composites are described.
