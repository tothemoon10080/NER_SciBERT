Abiotic and biotic reactions operate side by side in the cycling of phosphorus (P) in the environment, but the relative roles of these two reactions vary both spatially and temporally. In biotic reactions, the uptake and release of P are catalyzed by enzymes and thus change phosphate oxygen isotope ratios, while in abiotic reactions, the absence of hydrolysis-condensation reactions results in no apparent changes in isotope composition, except short-term kinetic isotope effect due solely to preferential ion exchange. Therefore, isotope method could be a promising tool to differentiate relative roles of these two reactions in the environment but the relationship of the dynamic concentration and isotope exchange at the biota-water interface is largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to develop a process-based isotope model underpinning the competition of abiotic (sorption, desorption, and ion exchange) and biotic (uptake, metabolism, and release) reactions during uptake and recycling of ferrihydrite-bound P by E.Â coli. Our model comprises equations describing the partitioning relationship among different P pools and their corresponding oxygen isotope compositions and is based exclusively on oxygen isotope exchange at multiple sites including mineral surface, aqueous phase, and bacterial cells. The process-based model adequately reproduced the measured concentration and isotope compositions over time. Furthermore, parametric and sensitivity analyses using the model indicated that the rate of biological uptake of P was the major factor controlling the changes of phosphate isotope composition. In conclusion, our model provides new insights into a mechanistic aspect of isotope exchange and could be potentially useful for future efforts to understand the interplay of biotic and abiotic factors on phosphorus cycling in natural environments.
