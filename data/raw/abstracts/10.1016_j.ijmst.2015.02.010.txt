Mining method selection is the first and the most critical problem in mine design and depends on some parameters such as geotechnical and geological features and economic and geographic factors. In this paper, the factors affecting mining method selection are determined. These factors include shape, thickness, depth, slope, RMR and RSS of the orebody, RMR and RSS of the hanging wall and footwall. Then, the priorities of these factors are calculated. In order to calculate the priorities of factors and select the best mining method for Qapiliq salt mine, Iran, based on these priorities, fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) technique is used. For this purpose, a questionnaire was prepared and was given to the associated experts. Finally, after a comparison carried out based on the effective factors, between the four mining methods including area mining, room and pillar, cut and fill and stope and pillar methods, the stope and pillar mining method was selected as the most suitable method to this mine.
