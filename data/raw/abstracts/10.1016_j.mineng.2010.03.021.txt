A new concept for the enrichment of lithium minerals is offering higher purity and higher yield by applying new processing technologies addressing the specific properties of the pegmatitic host rock. Additional value is created from high quality by-products which will improve the sustainability of mining activity and the overall cost base. Within the new concept, flotation may even be avoided where wet separation techniques are not applicable.
                  Two innovative processing technologies have been integrated in the new concept: electrodynamic fragmentation and optical sorting. Detailed results of lab-technical tests show that the new process design can achieve highly selective liberation and separation processes. Optical and mineralogical analyses of the test products indicate a high benefit for commercial applications.
