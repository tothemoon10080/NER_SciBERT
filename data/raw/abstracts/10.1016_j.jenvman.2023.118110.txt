The dispersion process of spilled oil is an important concern for the effective disposal of oil spills. The dispersed oil concentration and oil droplets size distribution were studied through a wave tank test under the application of chemical dispersant and suspended minerals. The results indicated that dispersant and minerals increased the dispersed oil concentration and the effect of dispersant was more significant, and they had a synergistic effect on oil dispersion. When dispersant and minerals were applied together, the volume mean diameter of oil droplets decreased in the first 30 min, then increased and reached a maximum value at 90–120 min, and decreased again. Moreover, suspended minerals could inhibit the coalescence of oil droplets. This study can afford data support for oil spill emergency response that occurs in inshore or estuaries.
