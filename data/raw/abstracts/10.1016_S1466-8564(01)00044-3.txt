HCl extractable mineral soluble in 0.03 N HCl the concentration of HCl found in human stomach is an index of its bioavailability from foods. The amount of HCl-extractable calcium, phosphorus and iron in raw and unprocessed seeds of rice bean and fababean were (70.2, 55.2), (78.0, 71.2) and (33.4, 35.1), respectively. Among all the domestic processing methods, sprouting was the best method followed by dehulling and soaking (12 h) for improving the extractability of Ca, P and Fe whereas did not affect the total mineral contents. The husks of these legumes had significantly lower levels of extractable Ca, P and Fe.
