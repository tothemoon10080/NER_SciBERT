In this study, specific amounts of garfish (Belone belone) fishbone powder were added to kefir and ayran, which are two important functional fermented milk products, and it was aimed to find out the changes that may occur in the functional and nutritional values, physicochemical and microbiological properties of the products obtained. As a result of the research, it was revealed that the added fishbone increased the physicochemical values (pH, % dry matter, and textural properties) of the samples in a positive way. The physicochemical values of the fishbone-added products were higher than the control samples. In addition, physicochemical values increased in parallel with the increase in the amount of added fishbone. The addition of fishbone powder significantly increased the mineral content (especially P, Ca, and Mg) of the samples and distinctly contributed to the nutritional value. Furthermore, parallel to the addition of fishbone, lactic acid, and organic acid amounts and the counts of Lactococcus/Streptococcus bacteria in the samples increased significantly, gaining ayran and kefir functional properties.
