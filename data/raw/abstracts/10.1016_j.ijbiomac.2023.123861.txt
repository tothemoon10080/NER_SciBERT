Compared with most nondegradable or slowly degradable bone repair materials, bioactive biodegradable porous scaffolds with certain mechanical strengths can promote the regeneration of both new bone and vasculature while the cavity created by their degradation can be replaced by the infiltration of new bone tissue. Mineralized collagen (MC) is the basic structural unit of bone tissue, and silk fibroin (SF) is a natural polymer with adjustable degradation rates and superior mechanical properties. In this study, a three-dimensional porous biomimetic composite scaffold with a two-component SF-MC system was constructed based on the advantages of both materials. The spherical mineral agglomerates of the MC were uniformly distributed on the surface and inside the SF skeleton, which ensured good mechanical properties while regulating the degradation rate of the scaffold. Second, the SF-MC scaffold had good osteogenic induction of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and preosteoblasts (MC3T3-E1) and also promoted the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells. Finally, in vivo 5Â mm cranial defect repair experiments confirmed that the SF-MC scaffold stimulated vascular regeneration and promoted new bone regeneration in vivo by means of in situ regeneration. Overall, we believe that this low-cost biomimetic biodegradable SF-MC scaffold with many advantages has some clinical translation prospects.
