This paper summarizes work on the application of multivariate methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), projection to latent structure (PLS), and neural networks (NN) to process data analysis and modeling. Potential applications dealing with a flotation circuit are addressed with particular attention to the comparison of results obtained from the application of these multivariate techniques.
