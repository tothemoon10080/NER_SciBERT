In the research of photocatalytic removal of VOCs, the mineralization rate of organic pollutants has been ignored. High mineralization rate means the reduction of intermediates, which is more conducive to environmental protection and photocatalysts stability. In this work, we successfully compounded conductive Ti3C2 with TiO2 for photocatalytic degradation of o-xylene. The production of CO2 by 1 % Ti3C2-TiO2 composite was about twice than that of pure TiO2. The results of PL and photocurrent response showed that 1 % Ti3C2-TiO2 composite had less carrier recombination and higher photocurrent response, which endows its stronger photocatalytic oxidation ability than TiO2. The in-situ infrared spectroscopy revealed that more aromatic anhydride species deposited on the TiO2 surface and led to the less mineralization degree for TiO2 sample. The four-cycle tests further confirmed the better stability of 1 % Ti3C2-TiO2 sample. This work disclosed the role of Ti3C2 in enhancing the mineralization of VOCs, which may provide a new perspective for the design of high-efficiency photocatalysts.
