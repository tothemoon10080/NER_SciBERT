We review here the Stenciling Principle for extracellular matrix mineralization that describes a double-negative process (inhibition of inhibitors) that promotes mineralization in bone and other mineralized tissues, whereas the default condition of inhibition alone prevents mineralization elsewhere in soft connective tissues. The stenciling principle acts across multiple levels from the macroscale (skeleton/dentition vs soft connective tissues), to the microscale (for example, entheses, and the tooth attachment complex where the soft periodontal ligament is situated between mineralized tooth cementum and mineralized alveolar bone), and to the mesoscale (mineral tessellation). It relates to both small-molecule (e.g. pyrophosphate) and protein (e.g. osteopontin) inhibitors of mineralization, and promoters (enzymes, e.g. TNAP, PHEX) that degrade the inhibitors to permit and regulate mineralization. In this process, an organizational motif for bone mineral arises that we call crossfibrillar mineral tessellation where mineral formations – called tesselles – geometrically approximate prolate ellipsoids and traverse multiple collagen fibrils (laterally). Tesselle growth is directed by the structural anisotropy of collagen, being spatially restrained in the shorter transverse tesselle dimensions (averaging 1.6 × 0.8 × 0.8 μm, aspect ratio 2, length range 1.5–2.5 μm). Temporo-spatially, the tesselles abut in 3D (close ellipsoid packing) to fill the volume of lamellar bone extracellular matrix. Poorly mineralized interfacial gaps between adjacent tesselles remain discernable even in mature lamellar bone. Tessellation of a same, small basic unit to form larger structural assemblies results in numerous 3D interfaces, allows dissipation of critical stresses, and enables fail-safe cyclic deformations. Incomplete tessellation in osteomalacia/odontomalacia may explain why soft osteomalacic bones buckle and deform under loading.
