The tendons of some birds undergo a physiological process of gradual mineralization, usually limited to the central portion of the tendon and resulting in an increase of the elastic modulus and the ultimate strength. The present study was carried out by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy and was focused on the structural and ultrastructural modifications occurring in this tissue during biomineralization.
                  In comparison with most other tendons, turkey tendons appeared to be more finely subdivided into thinner fascicles and to contain a greater amount of cell-rich endotenon tissue. The most obvious finding, however, was the complete disappearance of the crimps in the calcified portions of the tendon, while they were present with the usual morphology in the non-mineralized portion.
                  The electron microscopy revealed in the mineralized tendon traces of pre-existing crimps, locked in the straightened-out position by the infiltrating mineral phase. This latter was composed of two different types of fine particles, respectively, growing inside and around the collagen fibrils and appearing as tightly packed platelets or as larger, flat platelets regularly arranged in phase with the D-period of collagen. The perifibrillar mineral could play a critical role in the mechanical coupling of adjoining fascicles and in the transmission of tensile loads along the tendon itself.
