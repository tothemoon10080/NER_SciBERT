Our objective was to determine the effects of dipotassium phosphate (DKP) addition, heat treatments (no heat, HTST: 72°C for 15 s, and direct steam injection UHT: 142°C for 2.3 s), and storage time on the soluble protein composition and mineral (P, Ca, K) concentration of the aqueous phase around casein micelles in 7.5% milk protein-based beverages made with liquid skim milk protein concentrate (MPC) and micellar casein concentrate (MCC). MPC was produced using a spiral wound polymeric membrane and MCC was produced using a 0.1µ ceramic membrane by filtration at 50°C. Two DKP concentrations were used (0 and 0.15% wt/wt) within each of the 3 heat treatments. All beverages had no other additives and ran through heat treatment without coagulation. Ultracentrifugation (2 h run at 4°C) supernatants of the beverages were collected at 1, 5, 8, 12 and 15 d storage at 4°C. P, Ca, and K concentrations in the beverages and supernatants were measured using inductively coupled plasma spectrometry. Protein composition of supernatants was measured using Kjeldahl and SDS-PAGE. MCC and MPC beverages with 0.15% DKP had higher (P < 0.05) concentrations of supernatant protein, Ca, and P than beverages without DKP. Protein, Ca, and P concentrations were higher in MCC supernatant than in MPC supernatant when DKP was added, and these concentrations increased (P < 0.05) over storage time, especially when lower heat treatments (HTST or no heat treatment) had been applied. DKP addition caused the dissociation of αs-, β-, κ-casein, and casein proteolysis products out of the casein micelles, and DKP addition explained over 70% of the increase in supernatant protein, P, and Ca concentrations. DKP could be removed from 7.5% protein beverages made with fresh liquid MCC and MPC (containing a residual lactose concentration of 0.6 to 0.7% and the proportional amount of soluble milk minerals) as these beverages maintain heat processing stability without DKP addition.
