The study of pressure stimulated current (PSC) changes of rocks is significant to monitor dynamic disasters in mines and rock masses. The existing studies focus on change laws and mechanism of currents generated under the loading of rocks. An electrical and mechanics test system was established in this paper to explore the impacts of loading rates on PSCs. The results indicated that PSC curves of different rocks had different change laws under low/high loading rates. When the loading rate was relatively low, PSC curves firstly changed gently and then increased exponentially. Under high loading rates, PSC curves experienced the rapid increase stage, gentle increase stage and sudden change stage. The compressive strength could greatly affect the peak PSC in case of rock failure. The loading rate was a key factor in average PSC. Under low loading rates, the variations of PSCs conformed to the damage charge model of fracture mechanics, while they did not at the fracture moment. Under high loading rates, the PSCs at low stress didnâ€™t fit the model due to the stress impact effects. The experimental results could provide theoretical basis for the influence of loading rates on PSCs.
