Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most prevalent chronic liver disease worldwide. Minerals including iron, copper, zinc, and selenium, fulfil an essential role in various biochemical processes. Moreover, the identification of ferroptosis and cuproptosis further underscores the importance of intracellular mineral homeostasis. However, perturbation of minerals has been frequently reported in patients with NAFLD and related diseases. Interestingly, studies have attempted to establish an association between mineral disorders and NAFLD pathological features, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammatory response, and fibrogenesis. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the current understanding of mineral metabolism (i.e., absorption, utilization, and transport) and mineral interactions in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. More importantly, this review highlights potential therapeutic strategies, challenges, future directions for targeting mineral metabolism in the treatment of NAFLD.
