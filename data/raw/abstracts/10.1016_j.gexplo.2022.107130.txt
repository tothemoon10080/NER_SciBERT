There has been an increasing demand for manganese (Mn) in modern industries for the production of steel and power batteries in China. However, the lack of Mn reserves and poor quality of Mn resources in China have increased dependence on imported Mn. Therefore, it is essential to understand the concentration and distribution of Mn throughout China. The China Geochemical Baselines project provides nationwide Mn baseline data from 3382 soil samples and 11,605 rock samples. Based on these data, this study presents the concentrations and spatial distribution of Mn in China. Manganese concentrations in the top and deep soil samples vary from 40 to 11,546 μg/g and from 46 to 11,595 μg/g, respectively; the median concentrations are 569 μg/g and 562 μg/g, respectively. The median Mn content of rock samples is 471 μg/g. Ultramafic and mafic rocks have relatively high-Mn concentrations (1007 and 1257 μg/g based on 51 and 551 samples, respectively). The spatial distribution pattern of Mn throughout China is mainly linked to lithology, geomorphic landscapes, and areas of mineralization. Parent rock types, particularly mafic rocks, may govern the distribution of Mn enrichment in the soil of China. The concentration centers of Mn anomalies (>P97.5) showed good correlation with known Mn mineralization. Therefore, the results of this study may provide exploration indicators and targets for Mn deposits.
