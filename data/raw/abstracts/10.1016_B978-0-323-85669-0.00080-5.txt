Flotation as the workhorse of the mineral industry since the industrial revolution is a separation of hydrophobic particles from hydrophilic ones by attaching themselves to air bubbles that rise to the top for collection, leaving hydrophilic particles in the suspension to be discharged. The interfacial properties determine the separation efficiency and are selectively reviewed in this chapter. The focus is on quantifying and optimizing hydrophobicity/wettability and surface forces that underpin many critical events of flotation such as the thin film stability, attachment, and coalescence. The adsorption of reagents is critical to controlling the interfacial properties in flotation and is also briefly analyzed. The latest developments in the separation of critical minerals from the Earth's crust such as Li-minerals and rare-earth-element minerals are presented to exemplify the significant contribution of flotation to the modern age of consumer devices.
