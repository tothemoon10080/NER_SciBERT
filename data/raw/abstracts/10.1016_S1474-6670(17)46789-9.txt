If a good formal model (e.g. a set of differential equations) is available then the design of the corresponding control system can be based on well established control techniques. However, mineral processes are difficult to measure and deep chemical engineering knowledge of their dynamic behavior is rather limited. Therefore the identification of reasonably accurate dynamic models is of primary importance. A qualitative analysis (positive, zero, negative) is the only realisticly applicable formal tool of common sense analysis. It is used to generate models based on very vague knowledge which is out of reach of classical calculi. An unsteady state behavour of a gold mine filter (15 variables) is presented in detail.
