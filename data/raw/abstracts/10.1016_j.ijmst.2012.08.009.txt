Various semicokes were obtained from medium-low temperature pyrolysis of Dongrong long flame coal. The proximate analysis, calorific value and Hardgrove grindability index (HGI) of semicokes were determined, and the ignition temperature, burnout temperature, ignition index, burnout index, burnout ratio, combustion characteristic index of semicokes were measured and analyzed using thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). The effects of pyrolysis temperature, heating rate, and pyrolysis time on yield, composition and calorific value of long flame coal derived semicokes were investigated, especially the influence of pyrolysis temperature on combustion characteristics and grindability of the semicokes was studied combined with X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of semicokes. The results show that the volatile content, ash content and calorific value of semicokes pyrolyzed at all process parameters studied meet the technical specifications of the pulverized coal-fired furnaces (PCFF) referring to China Standards GB/T 7562-1998. The pyrolysis temperature is the most influential factor among pyrolysis process parameters. As pyrolysis temperature increases, the yield, ignition index, combustion reactivity and burnout index of semicokes show a decreasing tend, but the ash content increases. In the range of 400 and 450°C, the grindability of semicokes is rational, especially the grindability of semicokes pyrolyzed at 450°C is suitable. Except for the decrease of volatile content and increase of ash content, the decrease of combustion performance of semicokes pyrolyzed at higher temperature should be attributed to the improvement of the degree of structural ordering and the increase of aromaticity and average crystallite size of char. It is concluded that the semicokes pyrolyzed at the temperature of 450°C is the proper fuel for PCFF.
