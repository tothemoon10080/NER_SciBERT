This study aimed to recognize an effective treatment-time combination for improving nutritional value of Garden cress seeds (GCS). In this study GCS were subjected to different pre-treatments combinations viz., BoR- boiling (10 min) + roasting (2.5, 5 and 7.5 min), BlR- blanching (3 min) + roasting (2.5, 5 and 7.5 min) and SR- soaking (12 hrs) + roasting (2.5, 5 and 7.5 min), respectively. Results revealed for proximate composition showed slight variation in protein content ranged from 21.08 to 22.90% among treatments. Results for treatment SR 2.5 showed significant (p<0.05) increase in ash content from 4.62 to 5.24%. Results reported for treatment BoR showed significant improvement in iron content (10.84 mg/100 g) with increase in roasting time i.e., treatment BoR 7.5. The significant (p < 0.05) decrease in anti-nutritional factors from 458.3 to 414.5 mg/100 g for phytates, and 152.11 to 93.93 mg/100 g for oxalates were observed in treatment SR 7.5 with maximum retention of calcium of 378 mg/100 g. It could be concluded that overall improvement in nutrient content and maximum nutrient retention was observed during soaking and subsequent roasting. Thus, treatment SR 7.5 can be considered as best pre-treatment for enhanced nutritional value and decreased antinutritional profile of GCS.
