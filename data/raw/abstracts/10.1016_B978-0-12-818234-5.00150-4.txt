This article overviews connections between nanoscale weathering and geomorphology. Nanoscale processes are on one side of a fundamental threshold between the coarser microscale (micrometers and up) and the finer nanoscale with different molecular dynamics. Nanoscale processes impact a variety of geomorphic research including Arctic and alpine mineral decay, biotic weathering as an explanation for deviations from Goldichâ€™s weathering series, carbon sequestration related to silicate dissolution, case hardening, detachment limited erosion, dirt cracking, geochemical pollution, the meteoric 10Be cosmogenic nuclide, rock coating behavior, silt production, and tafoni.
