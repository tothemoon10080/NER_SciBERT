Regeneration of bone tissues requires a combination of biomaterial with functional characteristics in the tissue engineering domain. Therefore, a biomaterial of polymer and ceramic which is biodegradable and biocompatible can overpower the shortcomings of traditional methods of the bone substituent.Â Nanohydroxyapatite being bioactive, biocompatible and osteoconductive can affect the cell behaviour. In this work, we developed a polysaccharide-based biomaterial with nanohydroxyapatite as a filler in its matrix. The physicochemical characterisation was done by SEM, DLS, XRD, TGA and FTIR techniques. This material is biocompatible towards non-osteoblasts and osteoblasts cells and exhibit no cytotoxic effects. Accordingly, this biomaterial enhances the in vitro biomineralization of osteoblast cells in the presence of osteoinductive conditions. The current work demonstrates that this biomaterial has the high potential to be utilized in bone regeneration and tissue engineering. We propose that this material may have broad bio-medical as well as commercial importance.
