A novel bacterium, Ochrobactrum sp. T, capable of simultaneous debromination and aerobic mineralization of tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA), was isolated from a sludge sample collected from an electronic-waste recycling site. The bacterium exhibited maximal debrominase activity at pH 6.5, 35°C, and 200rpm in Luria–Bertani culture medium. Initial TBBPA concentration and pH had more significant effects on degradation efficiency than those of temperature and inoculum size. Degradation and debromination efficiencies of 91.8% and 86.7%, respectively, were achieved within 72h under optimized conditions of 35°C, pH 7.0, inoculum volume of 25mL, and TBBPA concentration of 3mgL−1. In addition, a 35.6% decrease in total organic carbon was observed after the degradation of 5mgL−1 TBBPA for 120h. Eight metabolic intermediates were identified during the biodegradation of TBBPA. This study is the first report to propose a one-step process for TBBPA debromination and mineralization by a single bacterial strain.
