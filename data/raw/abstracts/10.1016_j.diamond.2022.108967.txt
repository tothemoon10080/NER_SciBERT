Suspensions of hydrogenated detonation nanodiamond (DND) particles in mineral oil are electrorheological fluids: their viscosity and yield stress increase under an electric field. The effect of the initial DND particles size obtained during the explosion on the properties of low-filled (up to 4 wt%) electrorheological fluids was considered. The small-angle X-ray scattering method revealed the differences in the structural organization of DNDs with sizes of 3 and 5 nm in a mineral oil, which affects the sedimentation stability of suspensions and their electrorheological behavior. The sedimentation ratio and the values of the yield stress are lower for 3 nm particles suspensions in the whole studied electric field strength (0–6 kV/mm). The method of impedance dielectric spectroscopy showed the differences in the electrophysical characteristics of suspensions filled with particles of 3 and 5 nm. The activation energies of polarization processes were estimated from the temperature dependences of the dielectric loss modulus. The study shows the key role of filler size for creating high performance electrosensitive materials and hypothesizes the reasons for different properties of electrorheological fluids filled by 3 and 5 nm DND particles.
