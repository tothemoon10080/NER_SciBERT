Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technique was utilized to investigate the green mineral fluorite (CaF2) samples. The LIBS experiment was implemented by using Nd: YAG Laser system and a linear array CCD detector coupled with an Avantes spectrometer in an air atmosphere. The emission spectra of ten various fluorite samples were studied. The molecular bands correspond to the green B2Σ+-X2Σ+ and orange A2Π-X2Σ systems of diatomic CaF-molecule, specifically at Δν = -1, 0, +1 sequences and the CaO diatomic molecule between 618 nm and 630 nm were detected. It was observed that the CaF-diatomic molecular emission bands exhibited stronger optical emission compared to the fluorine (F) atomic lines. Chemical composition (wt.%) analysis was acquired using CF-LIBS methodology under optically thin and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions. Our CF-LIBS studies revealed that Ca (50–60%) and F (30–40%) were the major elements, while C (3–5%) and O (2–5%) were minor elements present in all samples. For comparison, we employed energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) technique to study the essential elemental composition (wt.%). The results achieved from CF-LIBS were found to be in good agreement to that obtained from the EDX technique. To validate CF-LIBS results, the calibration curve method was employed using the validated samples (S3, S5, and S7). Furthermore, we utilized a principal component analysis (PCA) technique on the LIBS spectral data to classify the fluorite samples.
