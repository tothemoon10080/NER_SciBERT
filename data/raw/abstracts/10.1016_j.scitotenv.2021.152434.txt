Photocatalysis is an effective, inexpensive and environmentally friendly technology for the decomposition of various aqueous organic pollutants and plays an increasingly critical role in the degradation of pollutants. Natural minerals are abundant natural resources on Earth and can be obtained directly from nature. Natural minerals are excellent photocatalyst carriers that are environmentally friendly, low in price, and will not cause secondary pollution to the environment. Natural minerals have the characteristics of a large specific surface area, providing more active centres, and adsorbing pollutants to concentrate catalysis. Natural minerals are also excellent photocatalysts, such as haematite and magnetite, which play a very good role in the degradation of water pollutants. Studies that make full use of natural minerals are of great significance. This review covers the latest research on natural minerals as photocatalytic composite materials to degrade organic pollutants in water, including three parts: the classification of natural minerals, the structural description of natural mineral composites, and the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants by natural mineral composites. In addition, the current limitations and opinions of natural mineral composites are discussed to achieve better results in applying natural minerals.
