Timely operational information about the quality of ore material that is supplied to the processing plant is one of the most important issues in the field of mineral processing. Such a factor as the grain size of a useful mineral today requires a lot of labor and time for its study. At the same time, a change in this property of the ore material has a great impact on the recovery rate of the useful component. Prompt determination of the size of grains of recoverable minerals will allow for a more efficient homogenization of technological ore material supplied to the processing plant. This article is devoted to the express determination of the grain size of nickel-containing ore materials based on a comprehensive measurement of the magnetic characteristics of the ore flow. It is especially noted that the research was carried out with the involvement of young professionals and students.
