Environmental issues are playing an increasing role in the design of industrial plant, it is understandable then that the minerals processing industries should be concerned about reduction or containment of unacceptable emissions. The industry has a long history of applying techniques for the capture of materials and the technology has developed to enable most discharges to be effectively controlled. The exciting developments which are taking place at the current time are the modifications to the manufacturing processes themselves in order to promote low emission levels or emissions which are more favourably removed. The ultimate developments lie in techniques which facilitate enhanced recovery of product or components with economic by-product recovery. The economics of such operations are increasingly affected by the financial and physical constraints of effluent treatment and disposal.
                  Within the minerals and metallurgical industries there are four main sources of pollution: 
                        
                           1.
                           (i) Mining and site treatment
                        
                        
                           2.
                           (ii) Smelting
                        
                        
                           3.
                           (iii) Recycling
                        
                        
                           4.
                           (iv) Large scale combustion processes
                        
                     
                  
                  These processes result in the emission of a wide range of particulate and chemical products necessitating a similar range of techniques for their control. Reviews have been published describing both techniques for cleaning emissions [1].
