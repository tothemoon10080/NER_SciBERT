Landfilling is the most traditional disposal method of domestic waste. Plastic waste in landfill sites could degrade to microplastics (MPs) and diffuse to the surrounding environment with leachate. However, MPs pollution in landfill mineralized refuse has not been well recognized. In the present research, a detection method for mixed MPs of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS) based on Py-GC/MS was established and verified. The method is suitable for the rapid quantitative detection of large-batch of complex solid matrix samples, with an average deviation of less than 10%. Based on the method, samples from a landfill site in South China were studied, where PE was found to be the main component. The total concentration of MPs in mineralized refuse was 7.62 kg/t in the old area and 5.49 kg/t in the young area. Further analysis showed that the content of MPs was correlated with that of plastic waste and the landfill age, indicating that a considerable proportion was secondary MPs. The reserves of MPs in landfill sites may have reached an alarming number. In the absence of adequate safeguards, quantities of MPs may spread from the landfill sites, resulting in serious pollution of the surrounding soil and groundwater.
