Trace minerals are essential for the normal functioning of all living organisms. In addition, the positive effects of several medicinal plants have been demonstrated in aquaculture. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of a mixture of medicinal plants and test the synergistic effects of medicinal plants and chelated minerals on fish growth and immunity. Thus, in the present experiment we evaluated the combined effects of a commercial chelated mineral source (BonzaFish®) and a mixture of 4 medicinal plants including caraway (Carum carvi), green cumin (Cuminum cyminum), dill (Anethum graveolens), and anise (Pimpinella anisum). Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fingerlings (n = 225) were fed with five formulated diets, including a control diet (basal diet), Bonza (basal diet + 1 g/kg BonzaFish®), Z-5 (basal diet + 1 g/kg BonzaFish® + 5 g/kg mixture of plant seeds), Z-10 (basal diet + 1 g/kg BonzaFish®+10 g/kg mixture of plant seeds), Z-20 (basal diet+1 g/kg BonzaFish®+20 g/kg mixture of plant seeds) for 6 weeks. In diets including BonzaFish®, 50% of the inorganic mineral premix was replaced by BonzaFish®. Results revealed that fish receiving the Z-20 diet showed the best performance in terms of growth parameters, followed by the Bonza treatment (P < 0.05). The highest protease activity was found in Z-5 and Z-10. RBCs were highest in Z-5, while the highest WBCs and hemoglobin were found in the Bonza treatment followed by Z-20. Stress biomarkers were lowest in the Z-20 treatment. Results showed that Z-20 could elicit the most robust immunological responses of lysozyme activity, ACH50, total Ig, C3, and C4. In conclusion, chelated minerals could be successfully used to replace 50% of mineral premix with no negative impacts on fish growth and together with four medicinal plants, could enhance rainbow trout overall growth performance and immunity.
