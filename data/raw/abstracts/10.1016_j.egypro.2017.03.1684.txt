This communication briefly highlights our preliminary work on building a lab-scale, two-step CO2 mineralization process plant. Thermally activated serpentine was dissolved in one reactor to release Mg2+ ions without the use of any additive. CO2 from a flue gas (10 mol% CO2 in N2) was transformed into pure synthetic hydromagnesite at 90Â°C under ambient pressure conditions in a second reactor. A novel design for a solid dosing system was developed that allows for continuous feeding of activated serpentine particles. The operation under ambient pressure conditions, however, was found to be problematic with regards to liquid circulation between the reactors. Nevertheless, the experience from this work has allowed us to design a more robust experimental set-up for CO2 mineralization.
