The objective of this study was to present a new approach to mineral waste valorization, based on the synthesis of hydroxyapatite (HAP) as an efficient and cost-effective adsorbent for the stabilization of fluorides (F-) in soil. Hydroxyapatites were synthesized from the reaction of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and waste paper fly ash (WPFA), fine limestone clay (FLC) and limestone filler (LF) rich in calcite. X-ray diffraction characterization results showed that for HAPFLC and HAPFL the main resulting phases were brushite (CaHPO5·2H2O) and for HAPWPFA was hydroxyapatite (Ca5(PO4)3OH). The FTIR spectra showed similar patterns to natural HAP containing orthophosphate groups (PO4
                     3-), hydroxylated groups (OH–) and both types A/B of carbonate apatite. SEM-EDS analysis of the individual HAP revealed a morphology consistent with phosphocalcic hydroxyapatite crystals. EDS analysis revealed a Ca/P atomic ratio equal to 1.92, 1.85 and 1.7 for HAPFLC, HAPLF and HAPWPFA respectively, which is similar to the stoichiometry of hydroxyapatites (Ca/P = 1.67). The use of HAP as an amendment to stabilize fluorides (F-) in the soil was demonstrated to be effective, the addition of 1% of the different HAP allowed the decrease of the concentration of F in the raw soil (73.8 mg/kg) to concentrations below the IWSI threshold (10 mg/kg), to 4.68 mg/kg, 5.63 mg/kg, and 0.8 mg/kg for HAPFLC, HAPFL and HAPWPFA respectively. Fluoride (F) sequential extraction results showed that it was extracted from the residual fraction (Fraction 4) after soil treatment, and was generally trapped on the hydroxyapatites (Ca5(PO4)3(OH)) by anion exchange with the hydroxides (OH–) to form the stable and insoluble fluorapatite ((Ca5(PO4)3F).
