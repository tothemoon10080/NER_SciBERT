A new process is proposed for refining niobite ore that is found in Jiangxi province of China. Niobite, also known as columbite or niobiteâ€“tantalite, is a mineral that contains tantalum and niobium. The separation process includes two-stage grinding, gravity concentration, magnetic separation, and flotation. The tantalum/niobium concentrate obtained had a grade of Ta2O5 18.28%, Nb2O5 41.62% at a recovery rate of Ta2O5 49.08%, Nb2O5 70.77%. Other minerals occurring along with the niobite, such as zinnwaldite, feldspar, and quartz, were also recovered to comprehensively utilize this ore.
