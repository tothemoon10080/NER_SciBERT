Biochars have been highlighted as a means of carbon sequestration, which is significant for achieving carbon neutrality. Mixtures of wood chips and either bentonite or kaolin were co-pyrolysed at temperatures of 350 °C and 550 °C, and the microstructural characteristics and the carbon sequestration potential of the resultant biochar were explored in the study. The addition of minerals promoted the formation of a stable carbon structure in biochar, especially the proportion of SiC bonds in the high-temperature mineral-composited biochar increased by 3.56–3.82 times compared with the original biochar. After bentonite or kaolin was added to wood chips pyrolysed at 550 °C, the carbon loss after H2O2 oxidation was reduced to no more than 19.2%, and the Recalcitrance Index (R50) of biochar increased to no less than 0.89. The combined action of high temperature and minerals promoted the formation of highly aromatic structures of biochar (H:C < 0.4) and reduced the amount of dissolved organic carbon to 4.89 mg g−1. Furthermore, minerals directly covered the surface of biochar, and the content of SiC bond increased, thus strengthening the chemical and thermal stability of biochar. However, the addition of minerals had no significant effect on the biological stability of biochar. The study indicates that the pre-pyrolysis mineral addition is an effective way to increase the carbon sequestration potential of biochar.
