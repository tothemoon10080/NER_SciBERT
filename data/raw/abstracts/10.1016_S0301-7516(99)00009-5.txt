This review is a brief account of R&D results generated from microwave-assisted mineral treatments tests. The R&D results demonstrate that microwave energy has potential in mineral treatment and metal recovery operations such as heating, drying, carbothermic reduction of oxide minerals, leaching, roasting/smelting, pretreatment of refractory gold ore and concentrate, spent carbon regeneration and waste management. However, challenges remain to be overcome through a fundamental understanding of microwave interaction with minerals, innovations, R&D investigations and advanced engineering, especially in designing efficient applicator, processes and process control devices.
