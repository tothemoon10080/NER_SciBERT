Objective
                  We aimed to investigate whether Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms present in the genes of tooth mineral tissues influence dental caries trajectory across the life course, and if there is an epistatic (gene-gene) interaction between these SNPs.
               
                  Methods
                  A representative sample of all 5,914 births from the 1982 Pelotas birth cohort study was prospectively investigated. Dental caries trajectory across the life course was assessed at 15(n = 888), 24(n = 720), and 31 years old(n = 539). Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify distinct subgroups of individuals whose caries measurements followed a similar pattern over time. Genetic material was collected, and individuals were genotyped [rs4970957(TUFT1), rs1711437(MMP20), rs1784418(MMP20), rs2252070(MMP13), rs243847(MMP2), rs2303466(DLX3), rs11656951(DLX3), rs7501477(TIMP2), rs388286(BMP7), and rs5997096(TFIP11)]. Analyzes were performed for allele and genotype using logistic regression and generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction for epistatic interactions.
               
                  Results
                  The analyses included 678 individuals, those with allele C (OR=0.74, CI95%[0.59–0.92]), genotype CC in the additive effect (OR=0.52, CI95%[0.31–0.89]), and the genotype TC/CC in dominant effect (OR=0.72, CI95%[0.53–0.98]) on the rs243847(MMP2) were associated with low caries trajectory. Individuals with the allele T (OR=0.79, CI95%[0.64–0.98]) and the genotype TC/CC in dominant effect (OR=0.66, CI95%[0.47–0.95]) on the rs5997096(TFIP11) were associated with low caries trajectory. Positive epistatic interactions were observed involving two (MMP2 and BMP7; p = 0.006) and three (TUFT1, MMP2, and TFIP11; p<0.001) loci and high caries trajectory.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Some SNPs present in the genes of tooth mineral tissues were associated with caries trajectory and epistatic interactions increasing the network of SNPs involved in individual caries experience.
               
                  Clinical significance
                  Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the pathway of tooth mineral tissues genes may contribute significantly to the individual caries experience across the life course.
