In this study, the feasibility of converting kitchen waste into bioflocculant using Bacillus agaradhaerens C9 was analyzed. The result showed that strain C9 could secrete various degrading enzymes, including amylase, protease, lipase, cellulase, xylanase and pectinase, promoting the hydrolysis of kitchen waste. Strong alkaline fermentation condition was able to induce the bioflocculant production, and inhibit the growth of contaminated bacteria, which avoids the sterilization process of kitchen waste. The optimum fermentation condition for enzymatic hydrolysis and bioflocculant production was 40 g/L kitchen waste, 37 °C, pH 9.5, and the highest bioflocculant yield of 6.92 g/L was achieved. Furthermore, bioflocculant was applied to treat pilot-scale (30 L) of mineral processing wastewater for the first time, and the removal rate of 92.35% was observed when 9 mg/L bioflocculant was added into wastewater. Therefore, this study could promote the resource utilization of kitchen waste and recycling of mineral processing wastewater.
