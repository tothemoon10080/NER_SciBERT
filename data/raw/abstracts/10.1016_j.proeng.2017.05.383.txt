By considering the worldwide use of composite materials in stabilization works, according to sustainable and ecological principles, the present paper is focused on the analysis of changes of several geotechnical properties depending on components of bi-mineral mixtures and interaction existing among various mineral types. Correlations of soil geotechnical indices as plasticity limits, particle size distributions, linear swelling and chemical-mineralogical composition have been determined for two clay bi-mineral mixtures (montmorillonite-illite and kaolinite-illite). Dependency of plasticity limits with mineralogical compositions and ion nature in absorption complex and linear relations between activity factor and liquid limit â€“ plasticity index have been carried out. Effect of moisture content on soil properties, which influenced the aggregation or dispersion processes, has been investigated through a parallel preparation of samples resulting from the mixing of the component material in dry and wet state. Analysis of swelling characteristics has indicated various behaviors of clay soils depending on type and amount of mineral components. The influence of adsorbed ions on physical and mechanical soil characteristics on clay mineral mixtures, as well as long-term structural variations have been studied. The results will lead to improvement of material performances used in stabilization according to internal soil changes mixture behavior.
