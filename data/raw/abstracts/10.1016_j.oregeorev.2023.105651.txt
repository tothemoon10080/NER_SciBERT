The knowledge graph in geological applications is highly regarded, and its usefulness requires the support of geological survey data. Therefore, this paper proposes a mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM) method that integrates geological map knowledge graphs with geochemical data. The geological map knowledge graph is used in the vectorized form as knowledge features in the training of the mineral prediction model. It is also used for knowledge-based ore-forming interpretation of prospective areas, achieving bidirectional application of knowledge in prediction and interpretation of prediction results. Unlike most knowledge graphs, the geological map knowledge graph represents spatial correlations and geological features in the form of “entity-relation-entity” triplets, with geological map units as entities and assigned geological attributes. Based on this, an MPM process driven by knowledge graph and data is proposed: (1) Convert the geological map knowledge graph into low-dimensional vectors using node2VEC. (2) Align geological knowledge with geochemical data spatially through knowledge embedding gridization, achieving a forward fusion of knowledge and data. (3) Collect the integrated data using window sampling as the training dataset for DenseNet to train the mineral prospection model. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the method for producing a potential map linked to gold mineralization in the Rao Feng area, Shaanxi Province, China. The results show that the prospective areas with knowledge graph embedding and geochemical data are better and delineate six unmineralized prospective areas. Ore-forming interpretations based on knowledge graph information were conducted on the prospective areas, demonstrating strong consistency between the ore-forming geological features of the prediction areas and known mineral deposits.
