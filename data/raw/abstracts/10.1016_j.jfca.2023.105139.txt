Sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc, iron, copper and water content of the most consumed pulses in Argentina were determined. Mineral elements were determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. Potassium is the most abundant element inraw lentils (784 ± 142 mg/100 g), peas (947 ± 78 mg/100 g (whole); 1110 ± 63 mg/100 g (split)), chickpeas (993 ± 35 mg/100 g) and beans (1980 ± 525 mg/100 g), followed by phosphorus, magnesium and calcium. This behavior is repeated in boiled and canned pulses. Beans have higher potassium content (1980 ± 525 mg/100 g in raw pulses, 548 ± 167 mg/100 g in boiled pulses and 288 ± 31.8 mg/100 g in canned pulses) than the other legumes analyzed. The soaking and boiling or the elaboration of canned pulsescaused the reduction of the potassium and magnesium content due to solubilization in the cooking or covering liquid in the preserves. Calcium and sodium were increased in canned pulses and showed wide variability due tothe different formulations. All the legumes analyzed presented high copper content (greater than 30 % of the RDI) and are sources of iron and zinc (greater than 15 % of the RDI), These results will be incorporated into the food composition database of the National University of Luján.
