Mineral precipitation has been proven to be an effective surface treatment for reducing the porosity of Portland cement concrete (PCC), leading to significant improvement in its freeze-thaw (F-T) resistance. Inspired by human teeth, this study proposes to produce a protective surface layer for PCC through in-situ precipitating hydroxyapatite (HAP), the same mineral found in the tooth enamel, on the concrete surface to improve its freeze-thaw resistance. This protective layer was generated by simply treating the mortar surface with a diammonium hydrogen phosphate (DAP) solution. Experimental results reveal that the F-T resistance is significantly improved, with the DAP-treated specimens surviving three times as many cycles as the control group. The proposed treatment also enhances the compressive strength of the mortar specimens by 35% and reduces saturated water absorption by up to 50%. Analysis of mineralogy suggests that DAP reacts with calcium ions from hydrated cement, leading to HAP precipitation and calcium phosphate on the cement mortars' surface. Particularly, the nanoindentation results indicate that the mineral phase with a lower density tends to react more readily with DAP, leading to its conversion into minerals with significantly higher packing density. Quantitative backscattered scanning electrons (BSE) images and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) analysis verify that the microstructure of the cement mortar surface was densified by the formation of HAP and calcium phosphate induced by the proposed treatment. The proposed method exhibits great potential in enhancing the longevity of PCC pavements in cold regions.
