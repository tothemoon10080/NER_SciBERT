Synthetic minerals consisting of cement with different added components were used to investigate the breakage effect induced by high-voltage pulses in metallic and non-metallic components. Both inter- and intra-mineral induced effects were investigated. The results showed that the main determining factors on the induced effects were mineral properties and distance from the electrodes. For single-ball embedded synthetic minerals, the induced effect was mainly affected by the ball size and location in synthetic minerals. For multi-ball embedded synthetic minerals, there were no obvious differences in the induced effects, although the number of balls does affect the direction and density of current beams. The induced effect was mainly affected by the dielectric differences in the mineral components and it showed the characteristic of relativity. Its breakage behavior is mainly influenced by minerals associated with him. The induced effect was also shown by non-metallic components under specific conditions.
