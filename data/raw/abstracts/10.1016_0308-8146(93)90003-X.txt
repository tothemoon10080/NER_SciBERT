Sorghum and maize porridge are used as infant weaning foods in many African countries. Porridges prepared from the cereals have high viscosity; to reduce viscosity, the cereals are initially sprouted and made into flour or fermented before use. This paper compares the effects of these preparatory methods on the proximate composition, mineral and fatty acid characteristics of the sprouted and/or fermented sorghum and maize.
                  The preparatory methods had no effect on the proximate composition. The cereals are poor in calcium, iron and zinc. They are low in ω3 fatty acids but rich in the ω6 fatty acids. Germination increased the gross energy of the cereals. Porridges prepared from these cereals need to be supplemented by other foods.
