The alteration of minerals and temporal evolution of solution in reactive flow through granitic rock fractures were investigated. Two experiments at different flow rates of solutions (i.e., Reynolds numbers for the flow) were performed on granitic rock fractures with comparable hydraulic apertures. The fracture surface morphologies and masses of the fracture walls were measured before and after the experiments. The alteration of the minerals on fracture surfaces exhibited nonuniform features induced by heterogeneity in the soluble minerals and their nonuniform distribution on the rock fracture surfaces. The ion concentrations and pH values of the solutions were measured during the experiments. The variations of the ion concentrations in the solutions were complementary to the dissolution or precipitation of minerals on the fracture surfaces. The water-rock reaction was identified as the primary process dominating the reactive flow in the experiments. According to the principles of mass and charge conservation, thirteen chemical reactions were identified between the minerals on the fracture surfaces and solutions in the experiments and 3 out of the thirteen contributed more than 90% of the reactants in amount of substance. The dissolution rate of sphene for the experiment at Reynolds number 676 was higher than that at 3750 because of the higher reaction rate between the solutions and the rock minerals. A correction coefficient was introduced and calculated to describe the effect of flow rate on the reaction rate.
