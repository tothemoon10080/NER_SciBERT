This study evaluates the colloidal stability of polystyrene microplastics (PSMPs) in the presence of various mineral colloids. Although PSMPs were highly dispersive, they were found to be involved in the aggregation of each mineral colloid. The efficiency of mineral colloids to stimulate the coaggregation of PSMPs follows the order bentonite > kaolinitic soil clay > illitic soil clay > kaolinite > goethite > haematite. Surface charge density is likely a crucial factor that determines the efficiency of mineral colloids. In concentrated salt solution, PSMPs together with mineral colloids can be involved in various continuous and simultaneous electrochemical processes such as charge neutralization, double electric layer compression, van der Waals attraction stimulation and heteroaggregation. These processes may also occur in the estuary environments, where suspended mineral colloids may play an ultimate role in reducing the transport of microplastics into oceans while also intensifying microplastic enrichment in coastal sediments.
