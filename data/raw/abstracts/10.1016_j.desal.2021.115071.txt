Unexpected mineral surface fouling, or deposition, is a ubiquitously recurring problem in many industrial and municipal processes (e.g., membrane filtration, oil and gas production). Accurate predictions of mineral deposition and inhibition kinetics are critical for mineral deposition control. Unfortunately, no reliable mineral deposition model is available, potentially due to insufficient knowledge of thermodynamics, crystallization and deposition kinetics, and inhibition kinetics under complex operational conditions. This study developed a new mineral surface deposition and inhibition (MSDI) platform to overcome these challenges. Specifically, the MSDI platform integrates a Pitzer theory-based thermodynamic model that can predict mineral saturation levels up to 250 °C, 1500 bars, and 6 mol/kg H2O ionic strength. It simulates mineral deposition in two phases. In Phase 1, the first deposition layer forms in the stagnant laminar sublayer following batch crystallization and inhibition kinetics; in Phase 2, the deposition rate is simulated using flow dynamic models, and the inhibitor impacts are modelled by a Langmuir-type kink site adsorption isotherm. This MSDI platform has been validated by laboratory laminar-to-turbulent flow experiments and field observations. As one of the few mineral deposition prediction tools, the MSDI platform has solid theoretical foundation with great accuracy over wide ranges of applicable conditions.
