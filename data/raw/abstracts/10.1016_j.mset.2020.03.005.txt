CO2 is one of the key greenhouse gases that cause climate change and various ways are being explored to curb CO2 emission in the atmosphere. Mineral carbonation method is one such technique to capture atmospheric CO2 and store it in a carbon sink. However, due to the high cost, the mineral sequestration process is preferred for small emitters (>2.5Â Mt CO2). In this study, the mineral carbonation is explored to study its effectiveness in the process of CO2 sequestration. Further, the use of CO2 as a feedstock in the production of different industrial chemicals is explored. In the end, the efficacy of the mineral carbonation process in combating climate change is analyzed.
