This research work focused on investigating the proximate, mineral, sensory and microbiological qualities of chin-chin produced from a blend of wheat and okra seed flours. The okra seed flour was prepared using standard procedures. The wheat flour was blended with the okra seed flour at ratio 100:0 (control), 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40 and 50:50. Crude protein, crude fibre and total ash increased with increase in proportion of okra seed flour incorporation. However, decreases were observed for moisture, crude fat and carbohydrate respectively. Bacterial and fungal counts were within the acceptable limits and ranged between 4.0 × 103 to 11.0 × 103 cfu/g and 1.0 × 103 to 15.0 × 103 cfu/g respectively. Chin-chin made up of 20% substitution with okra seed flour was the most preferred for the blended products in terms of general acceptability for sensorial attributes. The energy value of the okra seed chin-chin ranged from 364.55 ± 0.12 to 388.73 ± 0.19 kcal/100 g. The study has shown that the employment of okra seed in the production of chin-chin could be a veritable and rich source of nutrients.
