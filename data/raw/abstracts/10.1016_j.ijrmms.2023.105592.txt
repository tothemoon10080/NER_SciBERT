Granite for hosting the deep geological repository (DGR) is subjected to thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) treatment for decades of years, while the variations in the tensile strengths of mineral grain interfaces (MGIs) with THM treatment are still unknown. Served as an important parameter in determining the macro mechanical properties of granite, quantifying the tensile strength degradation of MGI with THM treatment is crucial for ensuring the long-term safety of DGR. In this study, the varied tensile strengths of MGIs in the granite after different THM treatments were first directly measured based on a self-developed single-MGI mechanical test system. Three-bending tests were conducted on six-hundred MGIs, which were submitted to various THM treatments with a temperature of 25–175 °C and a pore pressure of 0–15 MPa. The tensile strengths of the interfaces of quartz, feldspar and the interfaces between quartz and feldspar were derived based on the Dugdale–Barenblatt (D–B) model. Results show that the average tensile strength of the interfaces of quartz is 1.06 times larger than that of interfaces between quartz and feldspar, and 1.13 times larger than that of the interfaces of feldspar. Besides, the tensile strength of MGIs seems more susceptible to the pore pressure than to the temperature, and the degradation of tensile strength is the most obvious in the interfaces between quartz and feldspar, followed by the interfaces of feldspar and finally the interfaces of quartz after THM treatments. Based on the characteristics of the tensile strength distributions of different MGIs after THM treatments, the tensile strength degradation models of MGIs related to THM treatments were proposed in meso scale.
