Epilepsy is a prevalent chronic neurological disorder that is associated with spontaneous and periodic unprovoked seizures. This disorder has a significant impact on more than 70 million people worldwide. Epilepsy is a symptom-complex condition with diverse risk factors which generate cognitive, neurological, and psychological barriers to a patient's life. Vitamin C plays a crucial role in neuroprotective activities. Previous observations showed that a depleted level of vitamin C in the human body results in epilepsy. Again, minerals also have an imperative role in developing the acquired immune system and are directly correlated with antioxidant defense mechanisms. Deficiency in minerals leads to the development of neurological disorders, and investigations have revealed that a reduced level of minerals leads to the progression of epilepsy. In the present chapter, neuronal distortions caused by epilepsy and the contribution of reduced vitamin C and mineral levels in epilepsy have been discussed to clarify their relationship.
