The disposal of red mud (RM) and dehydrated mineral mud (DM) presents a significant challenge for the global alumina industry. This study proposes a novel disposal method for RM and DM, which uses mixtures of RM and DM as a soil matrix for revegetation in the mining area. RM mixed with DM effectively alleviated its salinity and alkalinity. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that reduction of salinity and alkalinity may be due to the release of chemical alkali from sodalite and cancrinite. Applications of ferric chloride (FeCl3), gypsum, and organic fertilizer (OF) improved the physicochemical properties of the RM–DM mixtures. FeCl3 significantly reduced available Cd, As, Cr, and Pb content in the RM–DM, while OF significantly increased the cation exchange capacity, microbial carbon and nitrogen, and aggregate stability (p < 0.05). Micro-computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis showed that amendment with OF and FeCl3 increased the porosity, pore diameter, and hydraulic conductivity in the RM–DM mixture. The RM-DM mixtures had low leaching of toxic elements, indicating low environmental risk. Ryegrass grew well in the RM–DM mixture at a ratio of 1:3. OF and FeCl3 significantly increased the ryegrass biomass (p < 0.05). These results suggested that RM–DM amended with OF and FeCl3 has a potential application in the revegetation of areas after bauxite mining.
