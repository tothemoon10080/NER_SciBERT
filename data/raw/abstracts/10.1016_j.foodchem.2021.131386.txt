The need to update the Nigerian food composition database (FCD) and provide information on dietary factors contributing to chronic diseases is essential to managing health conditions. This study is analytical. Standardized Nigerian cooked foods were analyzed for minerals, β-carotene, vitamins, phytate, and oxalate contents. Mineral, phytate-mineral interactions, and mineral toxicities in foods were evaluated. Results showed that okazi soup and akara & agidi had the highest potassium, sodium, and calcium (449.60 and 236.36; 1087.12 and 359.49; 568.55 and 481.05 mg/100 g respectively) contents. Miyan taushe, gbegiri, and groundnut soups had the highest β-carotene content when compared to others. The Sodium-potassium ratio of the foods exceeded standard values, while most soups including ogbono, ila alasepo, egusi, and gbegiri, had poor predicted bioavailability for iron, calcium, and zinc. Also, Akara & agidi, okazi, and groundnut soups contained excess doses of iron and sodium compared to the standard. These findings are useful to update Nigerian FCD.
