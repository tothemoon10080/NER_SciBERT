Bioactive hydrogels have gained widespread recognition in bone tissue engineering due to their versatile physicochemical and biological attributes aligning with the requisite bone regeneration parameters. In this study, we explored a calcium-free phosphate approach to enhance the formation of bone-like apatite within phosphate cross-linked guar gum (GG)-based hydrogels (P-GG). P-GG hydrogels were developed using free radical polymerization of acrylamide (AM) monomer and bis[2-methacryloyloxy] ethyl phosphate (BMEP) as a cross-linker. The structure integrity and interactions of P-GG hydrogels were substantiated through fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The GG content significantly impacted the hydrogels porosity, pore size, and mechanical properties. The hydrogels displayed a porous structure with a fibrous topology similar to a ladder, allowing for better cell growth and adhesion. The phosphate functionality embedded within the hydrogel facilitated rapid biomineralization when exposed to simulated body fluid (SBF) solutions. This biomineralization of P-GG hydrogels in SBF solutions was validated through a combination of analytical techniques, including FTIR, XRD, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). Together, the remarkable physical, chemical, and biological characteristics demonstrated by P-GG hydrogels emphasize their significant promise for use in the field of bone tissue engineering.
