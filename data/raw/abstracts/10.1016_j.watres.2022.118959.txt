The groundwater environment often undergoes the transition from anoxic to oxic due to natural processes or human activities, but the influence of this transition on the fate of groundwater contaminates are not entirely understood. In this work, the degradation of tribromophenol (TBP) in the presence of environmentally relevant iron (oxyhydr)oxides (green rust, GR) and trace metal ions Cu(II) under anoxic/oxic-alternating conditions was investigated. Under anoxic conditions, GR-Cu(II) reduced TBP to 4-BP completely within 7 h while GR only had an adsorption effect on TBP. Under oxic conditions, GR-Cu(II) could generate •OH via dioxygen activation, which resulted in the oxidative transformation of TBP. Sixty-five percentage of TBP mineralization was achieved via a sequential reduction-oxidation process, which was not achieved through single reduction or oxidation process. The produced Cu(I) in GR-Cu(II) enhanced not only the reductive dehalogenation under anoxic conditions, but also the O2 activation under oxic conditions. Thus, the fate of TBP in anoxic/oxic-alternating groundwater environment is greatly influenced by the presence of GR-Cu(II). The sequential reduction-oxidation degradation of TBP by GR-Cu(II) is promising for future remediation of TBP-contaminated groundwater.
