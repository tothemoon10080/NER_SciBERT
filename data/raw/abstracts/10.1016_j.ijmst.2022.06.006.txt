Malachite is one of the main minerals used for the industrial enrichment and recovery of copper oxide resources, and copper ions are unavoidable metal ions in the flotation pulp. The microflotation, contact angle, and adsorption experiments indicated that pretreatment with an appropriate concentration of copper ions could improve the malachite recovery, and the addition of excess copper ions reduced the hydrophobicity of the malachite surface. The results of zeta potential tests indicated that sodium sulfide and butyl xanthate were also adsorbed on the surface of malachite pretreated with copper ions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicated that —Cu—O and —Cu—OH bonds were formed on the surface of the samples. After pretreatment with an appropriate concentration of copper ions, the number of —OH groups on the mineral surface decreased, whereas the number of Cu—S groups on the mineral surface increased, which was conducive to the sulfidization of malachite. After adding a high concentration of copper ions, the —OH groups on the mineral surface increased, whereas the number of Cu—S groups decreased, which had an adverse effect on the sulfidization flotation of malachite. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry showed that pretreatment with copper ions resulted in a thicker sulfidization layer on the mineral surface.
