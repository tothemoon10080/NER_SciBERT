Oil production and refining use much water and emit hydrocarbon and streams related to mineral oil wastewater. Significant amounts of wastewater are produced due to the production, storage, distribution, and processing of petroleum, as well as by occurrences such as water accumulated from secondary containment and sumps, leaks from underground storage, oil well drilling, and spills from water/fuel mixtures. Petrochemical wastewater originates from various sources, and the composition of wastewater from different sources varies. Petroleum wastewater is generally made up of various compositions such as hydrocarbon and mineral oil substances. Grease, oil, and a variety of other harmful hydrocarbon and nonhydrocarbon compounds make up the majority of petroleum refinery wastewater. The physical and chemical indicators mentioned in this chapter can be used to express the characteristics of petroleum wastewater quality. This chapter describes components of petrochemical wastewater, as well as sources, identification, and characteristics of mineral oil and hydrocarbon wastewaters discharged by the petroleum industries. By evaluating these characteristics, researchers can better understand the nature of wastewater.
