CBM has been recognized as a significant natural gas resource for a long time. Recently, CO2 sequestration in coalbeds for ECBM has been attracting growing attention because of greater concerns about the effects of greenhouse gases and the emerging commercial significance of CBM. Reservoir-simulation technology, as a useful tool of reservoir development, has the capability to provide us with an economic means to solve complex reservoir-engineering problems with efficiency. The pore structure of coal is highly heterogeneous, and the heterogeneity of the pores depends on the coal type and rank.
