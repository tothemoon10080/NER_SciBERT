Many aquatic organisms deploy prismatic minerals as the exterior surface, where mechanical resistance and under-water superoleophobic behaviors are required. Although numerous synthetic strategies have been made successfully in the generation of prismatic minerals, few carry sufficient surface roughness that is a prerequisite to guarantee under-water superoleophobic properties. Inspired by the structural gradient in molluscan shells, we carry out seeded mineralization and grow prismatic films with grooved structure in the presence of a polymeric additive â€“ poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS). The adsorption of the polymeric chains on the (001) facets of calcitic embryos turns the growing mineral into tabular structures that become the structural units of prismatic films. The surface roughness of the grooved structure can be adjusted by the concentrations of PSS in the course of overgrowth. The time-resolved microscopic study reveals that the presence of the polymeric additives turns mineralization into a multistage process, namely non-classical crystallization. The overgrowth experiences the competitive growth pathway, which accompanies the size increase of the tabular structure and the decrease of its number density. The grooved structure on the exterior surface of the prismatic films ensures the appearance of superamphiphilicity and under-water superoleophobicity. Our study therefore demonstrates that crystal growth employing the seeded strategy and introducing polymeric additives can lead to the evolution of multifunctional prismatic films with complex structure and superwetting properties.
