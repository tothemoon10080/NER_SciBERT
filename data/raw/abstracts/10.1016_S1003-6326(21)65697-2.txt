The effect of conventional thermal pretreatment on the surface properties of ilmenite and its accompanied gangue minerals was investigated using flotation experiments (microflotation and laboratory cell flotation), XRD, XPS and FT-IR analysis and zeta potential and contact angle measurements. After treatment at 600 Â°C for 25 min as optimal condition, the floatability of ilmenite is improved from 73.5% to 91% at a pH value of 6.3. As demonstrated by XRD and XPS analysis, under this pretreatment condition, the Fe3+ content increases by almost 16.5% without any phase decomposition and structural changes in ilmenite. FT-IR analysis and contact angle and zeta potential measurements give evidences that the improvement of ilmenite floatability can be related to the enhancement of collector adsorption and the formation of a more insoluble hydrophobic layer of ferric iron oleate. The ore flotation experiments show that the thermal pretreatment process without making a significant change in TiO2 content of ilmenite concentrate enhances the TiO2 recovery from 65.4% to 73.7%.
