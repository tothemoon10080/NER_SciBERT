The objective of this work is to study the efficiency of some surface modified phyllosilicate minerals (bentonite and glauconite) in the removal of dyes from textile waste water. It is found that complete dye removal was achieved by using 10–25g modified glauconite from solutions having a dye concentration of 10–50mg/L. Adsorption data were modeled using Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherms. Adsorption capacities and optimum adsorption isotherms were predicted by linear regression method. The analysis of experimental isotherms showed that Langmuir isotherm reasonably fit the experimental data in the studied concentration range for the adsorption of dye onto glauconite mineral surface where Freundlich isotherm fit the experimental data for the adsorption of dye onto bentonite mineral surface.
