Investigators are debating on the positive and negative priming effects of biochar on native soil organic carbon (SOC), which is largely attributed to the technical barrier of identifying biochar contribution to the apparently measured SOC or mineralized CO2. We combined benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCAs) molecular biomarkers and soil particle density fractionation to identify biochar contributions to the carbon content in three representative allitic soils in Yunnan. The soil-biochar mixture was incubated for one-month to avoid significant biodegradation of biochar. The results showed that BPCAs were mainly distributed in free light fractions (fLF) up to 87 % of the total BPCAs contents after one month incubation. Recognition of BPCAs in occluded light fractions (oLF) and heavy fractions (HF) suggested a significant interaction between biochar and soil mineral particles. In addition, the percentage of B6CA is comparable or even higher in HF than in fLF or oLF. Thus, biochar-mineral interactions may be an additional stabilization mechanism besides the condensed aromatic structures in biochar. The apparently measured carbon contents increased after biochar application, and both positive and negative priming effects to native SOC were observed after deducting biochar contents based an accurate calculation from BPCAs. The most native SOC depletion (positive priming effects) was noted for the soil with the most favored biochar embedding in soil mineral compositions. This study emphasized that combining BPCAs molecular biomarkers and soil particle density fractionation could accurately quantify different carbon pools, and thus facilitate a comprehensive understanding on the stabilization and turnover of biochar in soils.
