Solid-liquid interfaces play a vital role in many mineral processing operations which are concerned with the separation of valuable minerals from waste host rocks. Froth flotation, arguably the most important mineral processing technique used for mineral recovery from complex ores, relies on the interfacial processes taking place at the solid (mineral particle), liquid (water) and gas (air bubbles) boundaries. Dewatering operations are solid-liquid separation methods involving coagulation and flocculation in which particles are aggregated via the use of reagents. These reagents interact with the solid particles suspended in liquid and modify their surfaces, a process that necessitates solid-liquid interfacial processes. Considering the above, the main aim of this article is to highlight the importance of solid-liquid interfaces in mineral processing operations and provide an overview of how the understanding of interfacial processes can lead to increased separation efficiency.
