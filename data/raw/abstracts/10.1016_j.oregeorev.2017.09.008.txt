The Hutouya Pb-Zn deposit located in Qinghai, China, is a typical skarn-type polymetallic deposit in the Qimantage metallogenic belt. This belt is characterized by extensive magmatic activity, complicated ore-forming element assemblages and various carbonate-bearing strata. Considering the geological features, mineralogy and geochemistry in the field, we have conducted finite difference simulations of the mineralizing process of galena and sphalerite in terms of a temperature-gradient driven flow. Specifically, we have used modern mineralization theory to quantitatively estimate the duration of the mineralizing process of galena and sphalerite in the Hutouya Pb-Zn deposit. The associated computational simulation results have demonstrated that the hydrothermal fluid flow is a key controlling factor of mineralization in this area. The mineralization of galena and sphalerite corresponds to the quartz sulfide stage, whereas the ore-forming time of galena is later than that of sphalerite. The best metallogenic temperatures of the galena and sphalerite are 150°C and 250°C, respectively. These computational results can enhance our understanding of the ore-forming processes in the Hutouya Pb-Zn district.
