Ore fragmentation is the most expensive step of mineral processing. The choice of lining materials on this type of machinery is based on ore abrasiveness. However, traditional abrasiveness tests do not consider particularities, such as the ore structure. The effect of the banded structure on jaspilite abrasiveness by conducting a CERCHAR abrasiveness test was investigated. A factorial design was applied, and the analysis included three test directions: parallel to the band of quartz minerals, parallel to the band of iron oxide minerals, and perpendicular to the bands. A hypothesis test was executed, and the difference in abrasiveness between the direction parallel to the quartz band and that parallel to the iron oxide minerals was found to be nonsignificant. However, the difference in abrasiveness between the direction parallel to the iron mineral band and the perpendicular direction was significant. Analysis of the forces monitored during the tests showed similar behavior for the different conditions. The normal load and friction force were correlated with mineral removal and characteristics of the jaspilite, such as porosity and the banding boundary. Furthermore, the observed wear mechanisms were in the transition region between mild and severe wear for all test conditions.
