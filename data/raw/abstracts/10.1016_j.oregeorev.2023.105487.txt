The Mufushan (MFS) and Lianyunshan (LYS) granitic complexes are located in northeastern Hunan (South China) and host important Nb-Ta mineralization. Fine-grained muscovite granites (FGMGs) occur as intrusions within the Lengjiaxi Group and show a spatial relationship with the ore-bearing pegmatites. Here, geochemical, geochronological, and isotopic investigations were carried out on the FGMGs of the MFS and LYS complexes to compare their magma sources and metallogenic potential. The MFS and LYS FGMGs are strongly peraluminous (A/CNK > 1.5) and highly fractionated S-type granites. Comparatively, the MFS FGMGs possess more negative Eu (Eu/Eu* = 0.19–0.60), Ba (3.3–360 ppm), Sr (6.2–156 ppm), and Zr (4–26 ppm) anomalies, and more positive Ta (1.1–15.8 ppm) anomalies than the LYS FGMGs, suggesting a stronger magma differentiation. In addition, the zircons from the MFS FGMGs exhibit higher contents of Hf (MFS = 34336 to 60010 ppm, LYS = 6795 to 28937 ppm), Nb (MFS = 16.49 to 401.56 ppm, LYS = 1.12 to 20.22 ppm), Ta (MFS = 33.45 to 138.65 ppm, LYS = 1.11 to 7.19 ppm), Th (MFS = 458 to 3630 ppm, LYS = 11 to 710 ppm), and U (MFS = 8400 to 30100 ppm, LYS = 1285 to 5220 ppm) than those from the LYS FGMGs, suggesting that the MFS FGMGs are more fractionated and their zircons have undergone hydrothermal alteration. Zircon U-Pb dating yielded concordant ages of 140.6 ± 0.5 Ma and 139.9 ± 0.7 Ma for the MFS and LYS FGMGs, respectively, implying an Early Cretaceous magmatic-hydrothermal event. Moreover, the geochemical and isotopic (whole-rock Sm-Nd and zircon Lu-Hf) compositions show younger sources for the MFS FGMGs compared to the LYS FGMGs, which were derived from the partial melting of Paleoproterozoic basement rocks with clay-rich material in a post-collision extensional setting. Our results, combined with previous studies, indicate that the studied FGMGs are the parental rocks of extensive Nb-Ta mineralization, and the highly fractionated MFS FGMGs are more conducive to hosting Nb-Ta mineralization than the LYS FGMGs. The strongly peraluminous and highly-fractionated S-type FGMGs can be used as good targets for further exploration of Nb-Ta deposits in South China and elsewhere.
