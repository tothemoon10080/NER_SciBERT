Bone regeneration scaffolds loaded with osteoblast-related cells or cytokines exhibit outstanding therapeutic potential during large-scale bone defect repair. However, limited sources of cells, opportune choosing of growth factors and their concentration, as well as immunological rejection, seriously hinder its clinical application. Developing a scaffold that can effectively recruit MSCs in situ and achieve endogenous bone regeneration is a viable strategy. Herein, we report a chitosan-calcium carbonate scaffold with high mineral content and centripetal pore arrangement using a simple in situ mineralization method. In vivo results first time demonstrate that the scaffold with high calcium carbonate content can effectively recruit MSCs near the defect area, induce their osteogenic differentiation, and ultimately accelerate the process of bone regeneration. Considering the accessible preparation and excellent osteogenicity, the chitosan-calcium carbonate scaffold possesses high potential for the therapeutics of massive bone defects.
