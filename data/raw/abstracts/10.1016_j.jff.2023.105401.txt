Mineral deficiencies affect millions of people worldwide and, in particular, in developing countries. Food fortification is a valid technique used for enhancing the mineral content in common and accessible foods. However, the loss of nutrients is a common disadvantage involved in food fortification. Encapsulation, via spray drying techniques, can increase the homogeneity of the additives in food. However, a poor understanding of the theory behind the particle formation in spraying techniques and the available materials for achieving an optimal encapsulation of minerals. In this review article, we provide a guideline on the selection of bulk and wall materials required for creating capsules of minerals to be added to common foods, such as dairies, carbohydrates, and tea or coffee.
