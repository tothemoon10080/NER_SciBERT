Geomechanics in deep mines becomes more complex and structural support in soft rock can be very difficult. Highly stressed soft rock subject to expansion deformation is particularly difficult to control. The Tiefa Coal Industry Group Daqiang Coal Mine is used as an example. A ventilation shaft, âˆ’550 horsehead, is located in tertiary soft rock. Analysis of the reasons for deformation shows an intumescent rock, which is easily damaged. Field observations and theoretical analysis led to a design capable of stabilizing the rock. A combination of spray, anchors, anchor bolts, and soft corner coupled truss supports allowed the deformation to be controlled. This provides a model for similar designs when support of a horsehead roadway is required.
