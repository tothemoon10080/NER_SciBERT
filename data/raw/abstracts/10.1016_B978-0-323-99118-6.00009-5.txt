Mineral scale formation is a major operational challenge in oil and gas fields that always comes with a high cost. Thus mineral scale must be detected early and managed to avoid detrimental impacts. Scale management involves preventing scale formation and removing the formed scale. Scale prevention can be achieved by means of operational, chemical, and nonchemical methods. Operational means are based on optimizing the process parameters to avoid solids precipitation and deposition the chemical methods are based on using chemical inhibitors; and the nonchemical methods are based on using physical methods that change the fluid properties to be nonscaling. Scale removal methods are based on chemical methods using dissolvers, and nonchemical methods using physical and mechanical means. In this chapter, mineral scale management is addressed, and a comprehensive scale management strategy is outlined in light of recent advances.
