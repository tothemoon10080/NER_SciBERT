Coal burst is a severe hazard that can result in fatalities and damage of facilities in underground coal mines. To address this issue, a robust unascertained combination model is proposed to study the coal burst hazard based on an updated database. Four assessment indexes are used in the model, which are the dynamic failure duration (DT), elastic energy index (W
                     ET), impact energy index (K
                     E) and uniaxial compressive strength (R
                     C). Four membership functions, including linear (L), parabolic (P), S and Weibull (W) functions, are proposed to measure the uncertainty level of individual index. The corresponding weights are determined through information entropy (EN), analysis hierarchy process (AHP) and synthetic weights (CW). Simultaneously, the classification criteria, including unascertained cluster (UC) and credible identification principle (CIP), are analyzed. The combination algorithm, consisting of P function, CW and CIP (P-CW-CIP), is selected as the optimal classification model in function of theory analysis and to train the samples. Ultimately, the established ensemble model is further validated through test samples with 100% accuracy. The results reveal that the hybrid model has a great potential in the coal burst hazard evaluation in underground coal mines.
