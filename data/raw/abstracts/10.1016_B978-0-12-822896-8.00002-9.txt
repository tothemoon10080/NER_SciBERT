Scale forms in geothermal power plants when physical changes in process variable such as pH, temperature and ion concentration cause minerals to exceed their thermodynamic solubility limit. This may cause mineral scale to form, thereby reducing flow and heat exchange. Depending on the mineral it is possible to have scale in the production well, steam separators, heat exchangers, reinjection wells and everywhere in between. This chapter discusses the causes and location of common mineral scales.
