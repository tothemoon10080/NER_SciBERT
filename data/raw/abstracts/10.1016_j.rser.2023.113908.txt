Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is of a crucial significance for realizing the goals of the Paris Agreement to slow down the global warming. The complex CO2 capture and mineral storage materials exhibit rapid development these years, and have been widely applied in CCS, which promise currently. In the context of that, it is necessary to develop an appropriate and timely review on them. In this work, the characteristics and performances of the liquid-based, solid-based, and microencapsulated carbon captures as well as in situ and ex situ mineral storages are critically summarized and comprehensively reviewed. Meanwhile, the possible solutions are proposed to improve their CO2 capture capacity and progress in CO2 capture and mineral storage. Their applications in post-combustion CO2 capture and mineral storage are systematically compared. This work will be greatly conductive to fully understanding the current state and future trends of the CCS and promoting the major breakthroughs in basic research and commercial applications. Thus, it may give a forward-looking perspective on the scientific and industrial development of CCS.
