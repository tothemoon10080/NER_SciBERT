The increasing complexity of reservoirs, particularly shale reservoirs, demands accurate information on the formation composition, mineralogy, and mechanical parameters for effective exploitation. The development of geochemical and geophysical logging technology allows the investigation of the correlations between the elemental, mineral contents, and the mechanical parameters of shale. Taking the Lower Cambrian Niutitang Formation shale in the Fenggang block in northeastern Guizhou as an example, 889 data sets of the main elemental (Si, Ca, Fe, S, Ti, Gd, K, Mg, and S) concentrations and minerals (carbonate, pyrite, clay, quartz, feldspar, and mica) from Elemental Capture Spectroscopy logging and rock mechanics parameters (dynamic Young's modulus, dynamic Poisson's ratio, shear modulus, bulk modulus, and brittleness index) determined via Sonic Scanner logging data in the target zone of the study area are collected. We investigated the relationships between the mechanical parameters and the elemental, and mineral concentrations by Spearman rank correlation analysis. The influence of different Si concentrations on the mechanical parameters of the rock (positive/negative, and significance) is discussed based on the mineral contents determined via X-ray diffraction of 24 experimental samples. When 22.1% < DWSi (dry weight fraction of the silicon content as a percent) < 28.40% and 28.40% < DWSi <34.20%, the static Young's modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus, and brittleness index exhibit a highly positive/negative correlation that is significant with the increase/decrease in DWSi, WCLA (dry weight fraction of clay), and WQFM (dry weight fraction of quartz, feldspar, and mica) contents, respectively. DWSi = 28.4% is suggested as the turning point for the correlation change (positive/negative, significance). Thus, there exists uncertainty in the determination of the mechanical parameters of rock within certain elemental content ranges. More mathematical models and factors need to be considered to adequately characterize the mechanical parameters of rock.
