To study the effects of germination and high-pressure processing (HPP) on the digestibility of nutrients and anti-nutrient contents. soybeans were treated by germination and HPP for 5 and 10 min at 300, 450 and 600 MPa. The bioaccessibility of minerals (Fe, Zn, Ca), free amino acids (FAA) and starch was determined. The inhibitory activities of phytic acid, tannin and trypsin inhibition activity were studied. The results showed that HPP significantly improved FAA release. The in vitro starch digestibility (IVSD) increased by 2.42 times after germination. Germination and 450 MPa/10 min treatments significantly increased Fe digestibility by 2.07 and 2.06 times, respectively (P < 0.05). Germination and HPP significantly increased Zn digestibility by 2.50 and 1.51 times (P < 0.05), respectively, and HPP increased digestibility of Ca 1.91 times on average. The phytic acid content decreased by 52.4 % and 6.1 % after germination and 300 MPa treatments (P < 0.05), respectively. For tannin, 450 MPa/10 min decreased its content (P < 0.05). The trypsin inhibitor content was reduced by 22.3 % and 10.76 % by germination and 450 MPa/5 min (P < 0.05), respectively. Therefore, the obtained results contribute to enhancing mineral digestibility, releasing FAA, reducing anti-nutrition factors and expanding the utilization of soybeans as food ingredients in the food industry.
