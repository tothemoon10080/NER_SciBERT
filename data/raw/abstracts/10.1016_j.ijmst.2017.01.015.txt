An underground iron mine in China has been used as a case-study to research the subsidence due to ore extraction and backfilling during open stoping operations. A 3-D discontinuum numerical model was built incorporating geologic complexities including faults and interfaces between different lithologies, and the stoping and backfilling sequence adopted from the mine plans. The stoping was carried out in two vertically stacked horizontal layers, with a total of 16 stopes. Large displacements of up to 50cm were observed along the roof of the stopes, and a maximum surface subsidence of 22.5cm was observed. Backfilling was found to eliminate subsequent displacements and subsidence. The extraction of the upper orebody was found to influence displacements in the lower orebody. Finally, a subsidence profile was constructed to show the subsidence at all locations along the length of the surface and region of influence on the surface.
