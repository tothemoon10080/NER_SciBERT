Quinoa bran is a by-product during quinoa processing, which is not well used due to its high content of antinutritional factors. The nutritional, antinutritional, antioxidative and mineral content were analyzed in quinoa bran from five producing areas (Hebei, Shanxi, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and Gansu Province) in China. The results showed that the mean values of protein, starch, fat, fiber, reducing sugar, ash, moisture and energy in quinoa bran were 9.35%, 47.37%, 8.26%, 10.74%, 3.68%, 6.25%, 9.29% and 360.2 kcal/100 g, respectively. Although the protein content in quinoa bran is lower than that in quinoa grain, it is comparable to that in other grains (rice, corn, millet and sorghum) and brans (wheat, oat and rice), so it has the commercial potential to be processed into animal feed or other edible food. The contents of antioxidant flavonoids (460.9 mg/100g) and polyphenols (477.8 mg/100 g) in quinoa bran were higher than those in quinoa grain, suggesting that quinoa bran had better antioxidant capacity. The contents of saponins, tannins and phytic acid in quinoa bran were 18.65, 0.30 and 0.73%, respectively. The content of saponins was nearly one times higher than that in quinoa grain, the contents of tannins and phytic acid, however, were lower than those in quinoa grain. Therefore, the removal of saponins is the key to eliminate the antinutritional properties of quinoa bran. The contents of macroelements (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus) and microelements (iron, manganese, copper, zinc, cobalt, molybdenum, selenium, barium) in quinoa bran were generally higher than those in quinoa grain, which was consistent with the results of ash determination. In summary, quinoa bran was found to be a rich source of nutritional and bioactive components and minerals. If the antinutritional problem can be overcome, quinoa bran has great potential for application in the food industry.
