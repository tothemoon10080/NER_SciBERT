The paper presents modern tools for designing integrated plantwide control systems for mineral processes. The case concentrator is Pyh√§salmi, where Outokumpu Mintec has traditionally tested its new products and ideas in practice. The other concentrators discussed are Empresa Minera de Mantos Blancos (Chile) and Etibank Kure concentrator (Turkey), where Outokumpu Mintec has successfully made the latest installations of its automation systems and equipment. At the Mantos Blancos concentrators a novel particle size analyzer PSI-200 has led to significant progress in the control of grinding circuits. At the Kure concentrator the COURIER On-stream Analyzer has played an important role in enhancing the profitability of flotation. The Proscon 2100 automation system with its application software GRINDCON and FLOATCON has enabled the utilization of stabilizing expert control and the design of the integrated control system plantwide. At Kure concentrator an expert system using on-line information from ore type has been designed to be added to the integrated control system.
