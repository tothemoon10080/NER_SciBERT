The rationale of a methodology for profitability analysis of integrated benefication systems is presented.
                  Simple mathematical models are used to describe size reduction, preconcentration and concentration and simulate a process flowsheet. Based on a synthetic characterization of the plant feed a mass balance is calculated and the processing units scaled up. Capital and operating costs are expressed as a function of the equipment throughput. Metal quotations are used in connection to the mass balance for the calculation of the net smelter return to mine and the operation revenues.
                  The system also permits the assesment of the benefits and cost consequences on including preconcentration in the integrated beneficiation process. When used for the analysis of a complex process flowsheet for low grade polymetallic ores it compares costs and revenues related to the beneficiation of each value, indicating those deserving their own beneficiation route and those with not enough intrinsic value to repay the cost of treatment.
                  The capacity of the method is demonstrated by means of an application example.
