The assessment of the individual nutrient content is not a sufficient tool for a comprehensive assessment of the plant raw material as it does not take into account the relationship between the nutrients. The study proposes new methods of modifying the mineral composition of buckwheat sprouts using plant growth promoters (PGP) and biological control agents (BCA) and new methods of assessing this composition using mineral quotients (Cohen's profile similarity coefficient (rc) and principal component analyses (PCA)). Based on the analyzes, the profiles of the mineral composition of buckwheat sprouts were grouped and their distinctiveness from the control profile was confirmed. Based on the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), Adequate Intake (AI) and Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL), a standard profile of mineral ratios was established, which allowed to refer the mineral composition of sprouts directly to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA). The difference between the standard profile of mineral ratios and the ratio profiles of sprouts treated with PGP and / or BCA was shown. This methodological approach broadened the possibilities of assessing the mineral composition of plant materials, especially in the context of the expectations of specific target groups.
