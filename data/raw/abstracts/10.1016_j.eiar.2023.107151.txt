As the demand for critical minerals required for solar photovoltaics (PV) technology continues to expand, there has been an increasing concern about supply risks of critical minerals, especially for large solar PV equipment manufacturers. Although supply risk has become a prominent issue, few studies were conducted on the supply risks of critical minerals from the perspective of multi-nations and the internal correlation between supply risks and economic variables. To this end, this study conducted a comparative analysis of the supply risks of chromium and gallium between China, the United States (US) and India from 2008 to 2020 and analyzed the impact of supply risks on the competitive advantage of solar PV industry by econometric models. The results indicate that: (1) For chromium, the fluctuation trends of their supply risks in China and the US are similarly stable (high risk), which are mainly affected by resource security risk and geopolitical risk, while India's supply risk fluctuates greatly with a relatively low supply risk. (2) For gallium, the supply risk of China is lower than that of the US and India, and there are obvious differences in supply risks in the three countries. (3) Resource security risk and geopolitical risk of chromium and resource security risk of gallium all have significant negative impacts on the industrial competitive advantage, and this impact varies greatly among countries.
