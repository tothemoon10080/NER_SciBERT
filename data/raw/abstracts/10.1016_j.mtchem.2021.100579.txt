Phosphorus is the main constitutive element of minerals and fat in the body. The process of mineral formation is defined as mineralization. The minerals in the body are mainly apatite, which is the inorganic phase that composes bones and teeth. It is worth noting that people with high fat content tend to cause excessive bone mineralization, which leads us to believe that different phosphorus-containing compounds in the body are mutually transformed and can regulate mineralization in different ways. The conversion and regulation of different phosphorus-containing compounds on the mineralization are essential for formation of a complex hierarchical structure and adaptation of the bone to various mechanical environments. Therefore, this review introduces the natural phosphorus-containing compounds in the body, introduces the hierarchical structure of the bone, and summarizes recent studies on different phosphorus-containing compounds (inorganic, organic, and phosphorus-containing proteases) involved in the biomineralization. We also discuss potential research directions of the biomineralization, offering the basis for future investigation of advanced bone substitute materials.
