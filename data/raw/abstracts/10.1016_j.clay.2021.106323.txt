Reduction of air pollution is one of the major priorities in today's society. The deteriorating over the years air quality has been posing a serious threat of human life. The most problematic gases include nitrogen and sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds and greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The interest of the scientific community on developing of new adsorbents with the ability to abate various air pollutants has been incessantly growing. Among many materials used for that purpose, clay minerals have been getting special attention. Clay minerals, due to their unique structure and susceptibility for modifications, are known to have good adsorption properties from aqueous phase, however they can be also applied in air remediation. This review presents examples of clay minerals application in the field of adsorption from gaseous phase; it depicts the use and performance of clay mineral such as kaolinite, halloysite, montmorillonite, bentonite, saponite, vermiculite, illite, sepiolite and palygorskite.
