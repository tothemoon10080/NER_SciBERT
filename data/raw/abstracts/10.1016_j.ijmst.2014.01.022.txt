In order to improve the dewatering rate and the effect of fine clean coal (FCC), the advanced method of fine coal (âˆ’0.5mm) dewatering and the correlated basic theory were investigated in this study. It was found that the dewatering by sleeve type press filter was an efficient way of FCC dewatering. On the other hand, the results also proved that particle size distribution, volatile matter, ash content, pore size distribution and specific surface area of coal particles of FCC samples, as well as viscosity and density of FCC slurry, were important parameters in determining the process of efficient dewatering. Especially, wet mass to dry mass, specific resistance of average mass, compressibility factor and microstructure of filter cake explained the reasons and mechanisms of fine clean coal efficient dewatering.
