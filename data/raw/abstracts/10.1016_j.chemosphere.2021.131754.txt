The problem of deep oxidation of low concentrations of VOCs in industrial tail gas is exceptionally urgent. The preparation of VOCs ozonation catalyst with a high mineralization rate is still a challenge. In this paper, manganese oxide carriers with different morphologies were synthesized by simple methods and used to catalyze ozone mineralization of toluene after loading Pt nanoparticles efficiently. The conversion of toluene over Pt/MnOx-T catalyst was more than 98 % at ambient temperature, and the mineralization rate of toluene was close to 100 % at 70 °C. Through a variety of characterization methods, the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Pt nanoparticles and carriers was successfully constructed. It was found that SMSI successfully optimized the surface oxygen species and oxygen migration ability of the catalyst, and then realized the high degree of mineralization of toluene at low temperature. This paper guides the subsequent development of Pt–Mn catalysts for catalytic organic pollutants ozonation with high activity.
