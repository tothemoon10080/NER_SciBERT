Biomineralization of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) using biomolecules has recently attracted significant interest because of the benign process including room temperature, neutral pH and without the requirement of any other chemical reagents. Also, these biomolecule incorporated MOFs (biomolecules@MOFs) have demonstrated their potential in biomolecule encapsulation, protection and controlled release. This work aims to develop a general strategy to make biomolecules@MOFs via a biomimetic mineralization process. A library of biomolecules (peptides and proteins) with different charges were systematically studied to fundamentally understand the role of biomolecules and their proprieties in biomolecule-mediated MOF biomineralization. Biomolecule charge, amino acid sequence and stirring speed have been demonstrated to play important roles in controlling biomineralization reaction rate, particle shape and morphology.
