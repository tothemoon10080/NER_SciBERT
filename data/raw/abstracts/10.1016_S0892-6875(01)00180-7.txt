The impact of fluorine in copper flotation was relatively unknown until the introduction of skarn ores in the Ok Tedi concentrator. Fluorine in the copper concentrates reports to the gas phase during the smelting stage and forms a corrosive H2SO4-HCl-HF acid brine mixture which must be neutralised.
                  This work was aimed at studying the mineralogy of the fluorosilicate minerals contained in the various oretypes present in the Ok Tedi porphyry copper deposit. The electron microprobe was used to analyse for fluorine and hence identify the fluorosilicate minerals in each oretype. This study revealed talc, phlogopite, biotite, clays, amphiboles, fluoroapatite and titanite to be the sources of fluorine in the orebody.
                  Laboratory and plant investigations were conducted to study the flotation response of these minerals. Chemical assaying of the products of these tests was done to determine the bulk assay of fluorine. Using Rietveld analysis, quantitative estimates of the fluorosilicate minerals in these products were generated. Marrying of the bulk assay with the respective mineralogical “assay” enabled the understanding of the flotation behavior of fluorine and it's associated mineralogy. Talc and phlogopite were found to be the causes of the fluorine problem at Ok Tedi.
