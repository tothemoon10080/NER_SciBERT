The volume of wastes generated by the mining, mineral processing and metallurgical industries now exceeds 1.8 billion mg annually. These wastes include gases, dusts solutions, sludges, and mineral materials such as mine waste, ore processing tailings and leach residues, fly ash and slags. Some of the wastes are being processed to recover minor or associated mineral and metal values such as gold, titanium, uranium and fluorine, and progress has been made toward processing or utilizing others but more remains to be done. Large volumes of materials still are discarded annually accounting for the loss of significant mineral and metal values which might be recovered to augment our primary mineral and metal resource supply base. In addition to the mineral values lost, the disposal of these materials imposes a substantial economic and environmental burden on the industry and the public. Special attention needs to be given to encouraging their recycling.
                  The resource potential of wastes generated by the iron ore, copper, coal, gold, and phosphate rock industries, and a number of nonmetallic mineral mining operations, are discussed. The progress made in recovering accessory or unrecovered minerals associated with mining and processing of the wastes is presented. The technologies now being applied or those under development, offer solutions to better utilization of valuable minerals and metals now wasted.
