Curd samples (n = 83) from 3 European dairy companies were analyzed for micellar and soluble mineral fractions content using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry as a gold standard method. The same curd samples were analyzed through 3 different near-infrared (NIR) instruments, and NIR spectra were merged with reference data. Prediction equations were developed using modified partial least squares analysis, and the accuracy of prediction was evaluated through leave-one-out cross validation. Overall, NIR spectroscopy was capable of predicting micellar and soluble mineral fractions in curd, but with differences among instruments. Fitting statistics showed that the visible NIR instrument in reflectance mode outperformed the NIR instrument in transmittance mode as well as the portable NIR instrument in reflectance mode. Prediction accuracies for most of the analyzed mineral fractions can be used for curd quality control in dairy companies and to aid in decision-making during the cheesemaking process.
