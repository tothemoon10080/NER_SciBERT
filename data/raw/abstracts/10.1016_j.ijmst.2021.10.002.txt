Understanding the mechanism of progressive debonding of bolts is of great significance for underground safety. In this paper, both laboratory experiment and numerical simulation of the pull-out tests were performed. The experimental pull-out test specimens were prepared using cement mortar material, and a relationship between the pull-out strength of the bolt and the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of cement mortar material specimen was established. The locations of crack developed in the pull-out process were identified using the acoustic emission (AE) technique. The pull-out test was reproduced using 2D Particle Flow Code (PFC2D) with calibrated parameters. The experimental results show that the axial displacement of the cement mortar material at the peak load during the test was approximately 5Â mm for cement-based grout of all strength. In contrast, the peak load of the bolt increased with the UCS of the confining medium. Under peak load, cracks propagated to less than one half of the anchorage length, indicating a lag between crack propagation and axial bolt load transmission. The simulation results show that the dilatation between the bolt and the rock induced cracks and extended the force field along the anchorage direction; and, it was identified as the major contributing factor for the pull-out failure of rock bolt.
