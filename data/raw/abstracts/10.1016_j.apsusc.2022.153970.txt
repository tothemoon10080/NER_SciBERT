A novel robustness mineralized layer was prepared on surface of AZ80-0.38Nd (wt. %) alloy via isothermal oxidation (420 °C for 4 h in air conditions), mineralization (40 °C for 10 h), and pyrolysis (95 °C for 10 h) treatments. The microstructure, composition, property and growth mechanism of the layer were investigated by SEM, EDS, XRD, XPS, FTIR and TGA technologies. The results show that the mineralized layer mainly consists of rod-like structure MgCO3·3H2O and flake structure 4MgCO3⋅Mg(OH)2·4H2O, exhibiting outstanding robustness. And the in-situ rod crystal MgCO3·3H2O and flake crystal 4MgCO3⋅Mg(OH)2·4H2O acted as reinforcing and toughening agents improve adhesion strength and densification of the mineralized layer. Additionally, the growth mechanism of the robustness mineralized layer is described in detail. And the work in this paper contributes a promising method for magnesium alloys surface modification, which will certainly facilitate their much total applications.
