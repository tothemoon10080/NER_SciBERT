The Nile Delta has a long history of shoreline change. Multiple distributary channels supplied large quantities of sand to the shore, producing beach accretion with extensive black-sand deposits found on the beaches and in continental shelf sands. However, erosion increased as discharges of the river began to decrease in the late 19th century as a result of climate change and construction of dams. The shift from beach accretion to erosion induced a concentration of heavy minerals on stretches of the receding shore, as light minerals were selectively displaced to accretional areas. In this review the physical processes are examined by which waves and currents sort and concentrate the heavy mineral grains according to their densities, sizes and shapes during transport of the beach sand between eroding and accreting shores. As such, the suite of heavy minerals found in delta coastal sands are used as natural tracers of sand movement related to large-scale shoreline change. Results, obtained from several studies undertaken along the length of the Nile Littoral Cell from Alexandria (Egypt) to the northern coast of the northern Israeli and Lebanese margin, are synthesised. These studies illustrate the importance of heavy minerals in identifying sediment point sources, tracing sand transport paths, grain sorting processes, energy levels of transporting agents and sediment provenance (both modern and relict). This contribution also evaluates the potential of applying heavy minerals to discriminate between accreting and eroding beaches and to distinguish a variety of fluvio-marine environments such as river, lagoons, coastal dunes, accretion ridges and continental shelf.
