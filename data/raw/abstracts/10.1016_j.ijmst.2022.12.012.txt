In this study, the innovative use of ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic sodium (EDTMPS) as a calcite depressant in scheelite flotation was investigated by flotation experiments, and its selective depression mechanism was revealed by contact angle measurement, FTIR analysis, Zeta potential test and XPS analysis. The flotation experiment results showed that scheelite and calcite could be efficiently separated under the following conditions: pulp pH=9.5, NaOL concentration of 1.5×10−4 mol/L, EDTMPS concentration of 3.0×10−5 mol/L, a scheelite concentrate with WO3 grade of 65.49%, recovery of 83.29% and separation efficiency of 65.29% could be obtained from the artificially mixed minerals. The analysis results of mineral surface properties demonstrated that EDTMPS was strongly adsorbed onto the calcite surface through the reaction between the phosphonate group and the calcium ions, which hindered NaOL adsorption and increased the hydrophilicity of calcite. However, EDTMPS had weak adsorption strength on the scheelite surface, which didn’t affect further adsorption of NaOL, hence, the scheelite remained hydrophobic. Consequently, the selective adsorption of EDTMPS on the two minerals’ surfaces increased a difference in wettability and thus enabling them to be separated by flotation. Finally, the mechanism model of this flotation separation process was established.
