Geopolymer is a more suitable alternative to cement composites with some exceptional properties. Incorporating graphene derivatives like graphene oxide (GO) into geopolymer composites can effectively improve the performance of the geopolymer concrete. In this study, the mechanical characteristics of geopolymer composites incorporating GO produced from fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) using mineral sand (quartz-feldspar) as fine aggregate are investigated. The effects of replacing river sand with mineral sand (quartz-feldspar) in GO-based geopolymer composites on the compressive, flexural, split tensile strength were investigated. This study approached a new surface modification technique to incorporate GO into Fly ash-GGBFS based geopolymer composites with 0.1%, 0.3%, 0.5% of binder content for better dispersibility of GO into the geopolymer matrix. The experimental results depicted that, at the age of 28 days, 0.3 wt% addition of GO produced an increase in compressive, flexural, split tensile strength values by 18%, 60%, 61.9%, respectively in geopolymer composites using mineral sand (Q/F) as fine aggregate compared to control mix. Also, an increase of GO dosage improved the resistance to the chloride permeability for both geopolymer composites using mineral sand (Q/F) and river sand as fine aggregate.
