Herein, we designed and constructed a model photocatalyst oxygen-deficient Bi@Bi2MoO6 (Bi-BMO-OVs) through a one-step solvothermal synthesis to deliberately regulate ROS generation and seek the crucial function of ROS during sodium pentachlorophenate (NaPCP) photochemical decomposition. The metallic Bi and oxygen vacancies (OVs) introduced in Bi2MoO6 prominently encouraged the yields of 1O2 and

This present work casts a new light on ROS mediated visible light photocatalytic decomposition of polychlorinated organic pollutants and opens up new possibilities for achieving their rapid detoxication via precise ROS regulation.
