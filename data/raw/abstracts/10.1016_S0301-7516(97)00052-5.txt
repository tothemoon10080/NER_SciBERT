In process industries, for a variety of operations the particle size is a critical parameter and the choice of the process to be chosen during mineral processing is determined largely by the initial size of the mineral. This paper reviews some of the. beneficiation techniques used and the influence of the particle size based on the work done at Tata Steel.
