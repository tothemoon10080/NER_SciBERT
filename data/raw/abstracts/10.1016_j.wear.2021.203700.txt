The suspended mineral particles in the mine aggravate the wear of hoisting wire rope and seriously threaten the mine safety. In order to explore the effect of different mineral particles on the fretting behavior between steel wires, the wear test of steel wires under different contact forms was performed by a homemade tester. Results show that the coefficient of friction between steel wires decreases with increasing the concentrations of mineral particles (coal particles and ore particles). The wear coefficient of steel wire decreases with the increase of the coal particle concentration, while for the grease mixed with ore particles, the wear coefficient presents the opposite change rule. Compared with the original grease and the grease mixed with coal particles, the wear scars of steel wire under the grease mixed with ore particles condition show more serious furrows, micro cracks and pits. The wear mechanisms of steel wire lubricated by the grease mixed with different mineral particles are abrasive wear, adhesive wear and fatigue wear.
