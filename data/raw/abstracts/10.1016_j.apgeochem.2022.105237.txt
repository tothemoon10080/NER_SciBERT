In marine sediments, microbial mineralization of organic carbon (OC) proceeds through a cascade of pathways using different electron acceptors. Rates and relative importance of individual pathways can provide quantitative constraints on biogeochemical cycling of a number of elements, such as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, iron, and manganese. However, such information is hitherto very scarce in the China marginal seas. To fill the gap, a multicomponent-coupled reaction-transport model CANDI was applied to quantify the rates and relative contributions of individual pathways of OC mineralization at three sites in the South Yellow Sea (SYS) sediments, based on which OC budgets were constructed. Model results at steady state generally well-reproduced the profiles of measured porewater solutes. The fast degrading OC pools G1 become exhausted over the upper 4 cm at the studied sites with the degradation rate constants k
                     1 ranging between 0.6 and 1.65 yr−1, while the slow degrading OC pool G2 remains almost undegradable on the timescales of the studied depth (∼25 cm) due to the low degradation rate constants k
                     2 (10−5‒10−4 yr−1) The depth-integrated rates of OC mineralization at the studied sites are in the range of 5.1–18.3 mmol C m−2 d−1, and aerobic respiration stands out as the dominant pathway, with its average contribution of 62%, followed by sulfate reduction (22.6%), dissimilatory manganese/iron reduction (8.4%), and denitrification (6.1%). Methanogenesis is a negligible process of OC mineralization within the studied depths. The contributions of aerobic respiration in the SYS sediments are much higher than the global average for marginal seas, but the contributions of sulfate reduction and iron dissimilatory reduction are much lower than their global averages, which could be ascribed to the low availability of degradable OC for anaerobic respiration. Budget of OC indicates that the mineralization and burial of OC in the muddy sediments account for 7.3 and 1.7%, respectively, of the total OC supplied to the sea, with the net OC accumulation efficiency of ∼19%.
