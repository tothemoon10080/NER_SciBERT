The mechanisms and kinetics of mineral swelling, alteration, and fine generation are described in this chapter. The models and rate equations for mineral-sensitive properties of rock and the methods for the interpretation and proper correlation of experimental data are presented. These models provide insight into the mechanism of the clay-swelling process and a proper means of interpreting and analyzing the swelling-dependent characteristics of clayey formations. They allow for accurate determination of the swelling parameters of petroleum-bearing formations. They can be used to predict the conditions causing wellbore stability problems and to alleviate the undesirable consequences of the swelling phenomenon in petroleum reservoirs.
