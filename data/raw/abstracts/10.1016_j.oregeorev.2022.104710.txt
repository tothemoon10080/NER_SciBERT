The Nanling metallogenic belt is rich in critical metal minerals, e.g., tungsten, tin, and rare earth element (REE). The newly discovered Zanshi tungsten deposit, located at the northeastern part of the Nanling metallogenic belt, has drawn great attention from geologists for its rare Triassic magmatic-hydrothermal event in this region. Based on detailed field work, a series of geochemical and geochronological analyses, including whole-rock geochemical analyses consisting of major and trace elements, LA-ICP-MS monazite U-Pb dating of the granites and quartz Rb-Sr and muscovite 40Ar-39Ar isotopic dating of the ore-bearing quartz veins, were carried out in this study, aiming to constrain the rock- and ore-forming ages of the deposit as well as the petrogenesis of granites. The whole-rock geochemical analyses, the medium to fine-grained two-mica monzonitic granites in the Zanshi tungsten deposit are peraluminous S-type granites and derived from the partial melting of metamorphic graywackes in a post-collisional extensional tectonic setting. The LA-ICP-MS monazite U-Pb dating on the two medium- to fine-grained two-mica monzonitic granite samples yields weighted average ages of 218.2 ± 1.2 Ma (MSWD = 1.3) and 221.7 ± 1.7 Ma (MSWD = 2.7), respectively. These ages are consistent with the quartz Rb-Sr and muscovite 40Ar-39Ar isotopic ages of the ore-bearing quartz veins, which are 218.7 ± 3.2 Ma and 215.1 ± 2.0 Ma, respectively, revealing that the tungsten mineralization in this deposit is related to the Triassic magmatic-hydrothermal activity. Combined with previous studies, the Zanshi tungsten deposit likely experienced about 5 M.y. of magmatic evolution and 3.6 M.y. of mineralization. Meanwhile, the cooling rate of the ore-forming fluids of this deposit was about 111 °C/M.y., which may be regarded as a controlling factor which affects the ore grade of the deposit.
