The compositional characteristics of many geochemical systems which involve the interaction of natural aqueous solutions with minerals and gases are conveniently described using the following thermodynamic components: Cl−, SO4
                     =, HS−, CO3
                     =, H+, Na+, K+, Ca++, Mg++, Fe++, Zn++, Cu+, Al+++, SiO2 and H2O. A set of mass balance and mass action equations equal in number to the number of components plus the number of saturated minerals (and gases) is defined for a specified temperature, pressure and bulk composition. The mass balance equations include terms for minerals, gases and the molalities of aqueous complexes and dissociated species. This set of non-linear equations can be solved with the aid of a computer using'a Newton-Raphson technique. The calculation takes account of aqueous ion complexing, oxidation-reduction equilibria, activity coefficients, non-unit water activity and solid solutions. The use of H+, SO4
                     =, HS− and H2O as components allows straightforward treatment of processes involving oxidation-reduction, evaporation, boiling and changes of total aqueous H+ due to hydrolysis, mineral reaction or temperature change. One product of this approach is a technique for calculating pH at high temperature from measurement of pH at room temperature.
                  By linking a series of discrete overall heterogeneous equilibrium calculations in which incremental changes of bulk composition, temperature or pressure are made, dynamic geochemical processes can be modeled. Example calculations for two such processes are given. These are the heating of seawater from 25° to 300°C and the isothermal irreversible reaction of rhyolite with an aqueous solution at 250°C.
