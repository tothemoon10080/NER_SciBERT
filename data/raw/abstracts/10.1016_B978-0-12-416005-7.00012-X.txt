Metal content and physicochemical properties vary widely between minerals. End users desire highest purity of minerals. Run of Mine ore is beneficiated through particle size reduction, liberation, separation, and concentration using physical and surface chemical properties. Ore is crushed, grinded and classified. Valuable minerals are concentrated by leaching, sorting with light reflectance, gamma radiation and X-ray luminescence. Gravity concentration is possible by panning, jigging, spiral, shaking table, multi-gravity and dense medium separation. Magnetic and electrostatic properties aid in concentration. Majority of ore (Cu, Zn, Pb, PGE etc.) is best suited to froth flotation that includes conditioning of fine liberated particles and reagents like collector, depressor, regulator and frother. Slurry passes through rougher-scavenger cells and concentrates. Concentrates are cleaned by washing, sedimentation and dewatered. Rejects dispose to tailing pond or void filling stabilization of underground stopes. Column flotation improves quality and recovery. Plant performance is judged by metallurgical accounting, metal balancing, operating cost, quantity, purity, recovery and valuation.
