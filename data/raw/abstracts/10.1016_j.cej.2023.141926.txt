Lead (Pb) as one of the most widespread toxic heavy metals in both water distribution systems and in surface water, it still remains a challenge to quickly and completely remove/recycle Pb ions from these systems. Herein, the obtained Mg2Fe-mixed metal oxides (Mg2Fe-MMO) through calcination of Mg2Fe-Cl-layered double hydroxide (Mg2Fe-Cl-LDH) showed extremely high mineralized capacity for Pb ions with removal figures of 2406 mg/g. This performance is superior to most reported materials, and can rapidly purify Pb2+ at 1 ppm to safe levels (12 ppb). X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) studies revealed a transformation from MgFe-MMO to defective Mg2Fe-CO3-LDH with the Pb ions sequestering OH− from Mg2Fe-CO3-LDH to form a solid precipitate. Moreover, the mineralized products could be recycled by electrolysis to obtain metallic lead, providing a new opportunity for pollution remediation and the recovery of metal lead. This work provides a new route for Pb ions removal from wastewater and the potential for utilization of the recycled Pb resource.
