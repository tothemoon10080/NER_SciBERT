Recently, a rigorous discharge limit for metallic mineral ions containing effluent has been established to ensure the leather-making industry’s long-term sustainability. Nevertheless, the existing intelligent biomass sodium alginate (SA) and chitosan (CS) adsorbents in remediating metal ions-contaminated effluent have been plagued by their compact structures as well as more carboxyl groups being occupied and masked. Herein, chitosan-sodium alginate polyelectrolyte gel with a semi-unzipping system (CS-SA(GTA
                        0.3
                     )) was rationally constructed with the help of unzipper glutaraldehyde (GTA) intruding. Half of the electrostatic interaction and half of the Schiff base reaction were the essence of the semi-unzipping effect. Such character endowed the CS-SA(GTA
                        0.3
                     ) composite with a loose, porous, and amorphous structure, thus improving its swelling behavior and exposition of more functional carboxyl groups, which demonstrated an efficient capture ability of commonly metallic mineral ions (Cr3+, Fe3+, Al3+, and Zr4+) compared with the traditional CS-SA gel bearing a compact structure. Based on pseudo-second-order kinetic model fitting results, the equilibrium capture capacity of CS-SA(GTA
                        0.3
                     ) for Cr3+, Fe3+, Al3+, and Zr4+ was 96.42, 95.95, 85.49, and 151.57 mg/g. Even in a large number of suspended solids, the semi-unzipping of chitosan-sodium alginate polyelectrolyte gel was still capable of capturing 149.69 mg/g of Cr3+ from tannery effluent, demonstrating the excellent potential for practical application.
