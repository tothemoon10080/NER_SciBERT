Delivery of nutrients through the oral route is considered to be the most admissible and preferred path as it follows the same natural process of food consumption in the body. To provide nutrition to the bone for overall good bone health, the present work aimed to fabricate soy films as a functional food for bone nutrition. The film formed was fortified with an in-situ mineralized bioactive glass (BG) network containing essential minerals required for good bone health. Also, vitamin K1 was supplemented into the films. Nutritional analysis depicted that the films are a rich source of protein containing about 67% of protein per 100 g having energy calories of 330 Kcal/100 g and essential micronutrients required for bones. The rheological studies depict viscoelastic hydrogel film-like properties of the functional soy-based film. The tensile strength of the said film is about 3.46 ± 0.17 MPa. The in-situ mineralization of the BG network in the soy protein matrix is responsible for the increased tensile strength and swelling properties of the functional film. The presence of essential oils in the film imparts antimicrobial properties to the film. Hence these soy films can be served as nutritional functional food having antimicrobial activity.
