Insufficient riboflavin intake has been associated with poor bone health. This study aimed to investigate the effect of riboflavin deficiency on bone health in vivo and in vitro. Riboflavin deficiency was successfully developed in rats and osteoblasts. The results indicated that bone mineral density, serum bone alkaline phosphatase, bone phosphorus, and bone calcium were significantly decreased while serum ionized calcium and osteocalcin were significantly increased in the riboflavin-deficient rats. Riboflavin deficiency also induced the reduction of Runx2, Osterix, and BMP-2/Smad1/5/9 cascade in the femur. These results were further verified in cellular experiments. Our findings demonstrated that alkaline phosphatase activities and calcified nodules were significantly decreased while intracellular osteocalcin and pro-collagen I c-terminal propeptide were significantly increased in the riboflavin-deficient osteoblasts. Additionally, the protein expression of Osterix, Runx2, and BMP-2/Smad1/5/9 cascade were significantly decreased while the protein expression of p-p38 MAPK were significantly increased in the riboflavin-deficient cells compared to the control cells. Blockage of p38 MAPK signaling pathway with SB203580 reversed these effects in riboflavin-deficient osteoblastic cells. Our data suggest that riboflavin deficiency causes osteoblast malfunction and retards bone matrix mineralization via p38 MAPK/BMP-2/Smad1/5/9 signaling pathway.
