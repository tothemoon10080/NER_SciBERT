Petrographic, Gandolfi-XRD and scanning electron microprobe analyses of samples from the Otish and Mistassini Basins, Quebec, Canada, have demonstrated that: 
                        
                           1.
                           (1) hydrated uraniferous mineral assemblages characterize each of the major lithologies studied. In particular, prismatic and radial polycrystalline aggregates of kasolite and dewindtite have been found within samples of conglomeratic sandstone of the Papaskwasati Formation, sector 1, Takwa and within samples of conglomeratic sandstones of the Indicator Formation, sector 3, Lac Indicateur;
                        
                        
                           2.
                           (2) microcrystalline, flaky francevillite and crust-like fourmarierite, minor uranophane and coffinite have been found within samples from erratic boulders of dolomite from sector 4, Lac Indicateur. Only one rare occurrence of uraninite has been identified in a sample of conglomeratic sandstone from the Papaskwasati Formation, sector 1, Takwa;
                        
                        
                           3.
                           (3) no uraniferous mineralization has been found in samples of north-trending gabbroic rocks cropping out within sector 2, Holton;
                        
                        
                           4.
                           (4) the presence of the uraniferous hydrated phases suggests that the mineralization has been derived from a primary uraninite source undergoing strong weathering by acid meteoric waters;
                        
                        
                           5.
                           (5) the gabbros which cross-cut the lithologies of sector 2, Holton, do not appear to have been able to cause a thermal rise important enough to generate a major remobilization of the system studied; and
                        
                        
                           6.
                           (6) it is suggested that special weathering conditions, including the presence of acid rains and extensive hydrolysis of the silicates, within the source region, before and/or during the transport and deposition of the granitic detrital fraction, must have prevailed during the Archean.
