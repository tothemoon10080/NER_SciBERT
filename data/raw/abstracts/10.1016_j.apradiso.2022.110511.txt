It is well known that many mineral deposits are related to hydrothermal processes, especially auriferous deposits. In this research paper, we show how to distinguish areas that have experienced hydrothermal activity, by construing airborne gamma-ray spectrometry data, especially potassium. An indirect application of aerial gamma-ray spectrometry technique is used to detect possible minerals deposits.
                  In this region, an airborne gamma ray survey (K, eU and eTh) was carried out, based on irregular K, “F” parameter -, and Th-normalized of the K and eU anomalies. This work exhibits the mapping of hydrothermal regions possibly showing gold mineralization and the pointing out of new geological portions for this sequence, establishing prospective criteria for regional mineral exploration.
                  We can suggest a new exploratory target, the area that is located next to Jabal Al-Ardiya (white colour on ternary map), which is characterized by high values of F-parameter, KD%, and K/eTh. Besides, enriched areas are found scattered in the north-eastern side of the study area. As result, the airborne gamma ray spectromertic data, might be used for estimation of prospective Gold Ore zones associated with the potassium alteration."
