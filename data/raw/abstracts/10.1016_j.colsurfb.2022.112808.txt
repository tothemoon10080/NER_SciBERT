Incorporation of biogenic or biocompatible synthetic polymers with inorganic mineral components have been suggested for the preparation of more bioactive materials. However, when two different inorganic minerals such as Ca- and Si-based minerals are introduced onto organic polymers, each mineral is deposited in a segregated form. Here, we presented a biomolecule-mediated preparation method for dual mineral-deposited polymer, in which two inorganic minerals were well-deposited on organic polymer with the aid of biological molecules. A chimeric bio-macromolecules, a fusion protein (CA-SFP) of carbonic anhydrase (CA) and silica-forming peptide (SFP), was designed and used. Surface-immobilized CA-SFP enabled the deposition of CaCO3 and silica nanoparticles on biopolymer without any segregated aggregation. SEM, EDS, FTIR, and swelling ratio analysis indicated that in the developed dual mineral-deposited polymer, each mineral was well-distributed across the polymer surfaces. Investigation by MTS assays, fluorescent imaging, and RT-qPCR revealed that the dual mineral-deposited polymer, when used as bone scaffolds, led to better cell proliferation and differentiation without any significant cytotoxicity compared to the counterparts. These results show that our mineral-deposition method mediated by biomolecules not only overcomes mineral-segregation involving multi-mineral formations, but also facilitates the preparation of highly-bioactive composite materials.
