This paper presents the different types of linear structures from mainly large blocks made from permanent Nd-Fe-B magnets with a high value of the maximum energy product and their implementation in mineral processing facilities. The methods of the assemblage of these large blocks which allow control the speed of the attraction of magnets during this assembly are described and discussed. The most serious problem in this case is the safe handling of large magnetic forces, both during the assembly of the magnets into the large blocks and subsequently during the insertion of these blocks into the iron circuit for final implementation. Linear assemblies can be of various designs, both in the individual and opposing arrangements, depending on the purpose for which they were designed and constructed. In technological practice, linear magnetic structures find significant application in the purification of raw materials using the methods of magnetic separation. Specifically, magnetic filtration using Nd-Fe-B magnets is a very effective method of eliminating undesirable metal impurities from the feedstock. Another method is the use of suspended magnetic separators, designed for the removal of undesirable ferromagnetic particles from the layer of the material transported by a conveyor belt. All the methods are described and discussed here in this critical review.
