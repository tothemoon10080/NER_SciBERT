Remote sensing and aeromagnetic data analyses were conducted for the characterization of basement structural elements that influence iron ore deposits and other mineralization over kabba and its surroundings. Spectral analysis suggests depth to magnetic sources range from deep, intermediate, and shallow with depths (i.e., 2.8 km, 1.5 km, and 0.3 km respectively). Three lithological zones were revealed on the Analytic Signal (AS) image which includes Meta-Sedimentary Complex, migmatite-gneiss-quartzite complexes, and undifferentiated schist and metavolcanic rocks. Structures interpreted based on first vertical derivatives (FVD), total horizontal derivatives (THD), and AS of the aeromagnetic images enabled delineation of long, deep, regional, inter-terrain linear structural features that are different from shallow, relatively short local intra-terrain structures. Typical potential mineralized zones are regions where the delineated structures on the AS coincide with FVD anomalies vis-a-vis zones exhibiting THD peak anomalies and highmagnetic susceptibility. These characterized zones also coincide with the location of known geologically deposits of iron - ore and marble. Mineral deposits tend to be dominated regionally by the dominant structural patterns (NE-SW to ENE-WSW, NW-SE to WNW-ESE, and E-W) delineated from SRTM and aeromagnetic analysis.
