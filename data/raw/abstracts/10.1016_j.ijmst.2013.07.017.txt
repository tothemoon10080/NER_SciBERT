One of the most critical and complicated steps in mine design is a selection of suitable mining method based upon geological, geotechnical, geographical, safety and economical parameters. The aim of this study is developing a Monte Carlo simulation to selection the optimum mining method by using effective and major criteria and at the same time, taking subjective judgments of decision makers into consideration. Proposed approach is based on the combination of Monte Carlo simulation with conventional Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine the confidence level of each alternative’s score, is calculated by AHP, with the respect to the variance of decision makers’ opinion. The proposed method is applied for Jajarm Bauxite Mine in Iran and eventually the most appropriate mining methods for this mine are ranked.
