Activities associated with mining and fuel extraction may present a range of potential health risks for nearby communities. The environmental legacy of mining and fuel extraction is extensive, with millions of active and abandoned mines globally. Evaluation of community risks from mineral and fuel extraction is often a complex task, given the variety of products produced, multiple potential exposure contexts, routes of contact, and health impacts. Adverse health outcomes that may arise from mineral-related processes include release of toxicants such as metals, metalloids, and mineral dusts, and indirect effects such as the increased potential of vectorborne disease. The ongoing processing and end-use of minerals also produce gas emissions (such as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide), often on a large scale. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are substances of particular concern arising from conventional crude oil and coal extraction, oil sands/shales wastes, and tailings water, and are classified as either proven or suspected carcinogens. The geotechnical and structural aspects of mine sites must also be considered, including the risk of major hazardous events such as release of tailings dam contents. Indirect or delayed effects of mineral and fuel extraction include those that act to affect community health through contamination or disruption of water supplies and food sources (e.g., crops). As with many industries, the balance between risks and benefits of mining must be carefully calibrated.
