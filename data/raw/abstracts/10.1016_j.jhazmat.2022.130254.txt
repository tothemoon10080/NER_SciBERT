Antibiotic resistance has been a worsening global concern and selective elimination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) while retaining the co-existed beneficial bacteria has been essential in environmental protection, which having attracted considerable interest. In this work, by integrating the whole cell imprinting and epitope imprinting strategy, magnetic bacterial imprinted polymers (BIPs) towards ARB were synthesized with interfacial biomimetic mineralization followed by a screening process. The binding data showed that the BIPs owned highly specific affinity towards the target bacteria. Taking advantage of this specific binding ability of BIPs, a two-step selective antimicrobial approach was developed. Remarkably, the BIP nanoantibiotics (nAbts) could efficiently destroy ARB without harming the beneficial bacteria. In comparison with the non-bacterial imprinted polymers, the biocompatible BIP nAbts showed a 12.5-fold increase in the survival percentage for the beneficial bacteria in wastewater. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that bacterial imprinting via interfacial biomimetic mineralization was developed, and also the first report of killing ARB without harming the beneficial bacteria in wastewater. We believe that this strategy provides a new insight into the design of novel affinity materials for the selective elimination of ARB in biological treatment for environmental protection.
