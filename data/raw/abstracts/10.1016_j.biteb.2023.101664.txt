Biochar is a solid product generated during the thermochemical processes of biomass, such as pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization, torrefaction, and gasification. As a material, biochar has been extensively used in fields such as water purification, pollution management, soil composites, and other industries. Even though the presence of minerals in biochar, such as metal oxides, has been established in literature, there is yet to be any study that has reviewed such works. This study reviewed the thermo-mineralization of biomass into metal oxide-rich biochar. The primary intent was to establish biochar as a viable and affordable source of metal oxide that merited further investigation. Biochar has been found to contain metal oxides, including those of calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, titanium, aluminum, silver, zinc, and manganese. Metal oxide-rich biochars were observed to be synthesized at peak temperatures, heating rates, and carbonization durations ranging from 200 to 1000 °C, 3 to 30 °C/min, and ≤600 min, respectively. It was also observed that factors such as the carbonization peak temperature, pre-modification of the biomass feedstock, and the duration of carbonization affected the concentration of the metal oxides in the biochar as well as the biochar yield, which was observed to range from 1.4 to 94 wt%. The extraction of the metal oxides from the biochar with the aid of techniques such as hydrometallurgical separation, pyrometallurgical separation, and magnetic separation was also discussed.
