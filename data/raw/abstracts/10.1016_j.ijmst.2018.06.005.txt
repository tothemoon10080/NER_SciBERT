Coal is an essential fossil fuel in China; however, coal mining and its utilization are being under the increasing pressure from ecological and environmental protection. Therefore, the consulting project “Technical Revolution in Ecological and Efficient Coal Mining and Utilization & Intelligence and Diverse Coordination of Coal-based Energy System,” initiated by Chinese Academy of Engineering, puts forward three stages (3.0, 4.0 and 5.0) of China’s coal industry development strategy. Aimed at “reduced staff, ultra-low ecological damage, and emission level near to natural gas,” breakthroughs should be achieved in the following three key technologies during the China Coal Industry 3.0 stage (2016–2025): including intelligent coal mining, ecological mining, ultra-low emission and environmental protection. This paper focuses on the development trends of the China Coal Industry 3.0 and its support for China Coal Industry 4.0 and 5.0 is analyzed and prospected as well, which may offer technical assistance and strategy orientation for realizing the transformation from traditional coal energy to clean energy.
