This paper describes an approach to estimate uncertainty propagation in mineral processing separation circuits. Since most modeling and simulation tools only consider deterministic input values, the inherent uncertainty induced by variable feed grade and stage unit recovery are not included in the design and optimization process. The method described in this paper combines the linear circuit analysis approach and the law of the propagation of errors. The result is a method that can be used to estimate uncertainty propagation, even in the early design stages where extensive experimental data is unavailable. To validate this approach, Monte Carlo simulations were conducted on 35 simple two, three, and four-unit circuit designs and the data was analyzed to show distribution statistics for circuit recovery, product grade, and separation efficiency. Both methods show nearly identical results, but the new methodology also gives fundamental insight on the reasons why certain circuits propagate uncertainty for specific performance indicators.
