Mineral-organic-microbial interactions drive many important biogeochemical reactions in soil environments. Microbial mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM) is an important process in which carbon (C) and nutrients are transformed to CO2 and plant-available forms of nutrients that sustain life on the Earth. Microbes can solubilize, precipitate, and transform minerals and thus can a significant influence on physical and chemical properties of minerals. There is an emerging view that microbial residues and dead microbial cells (or necromass) are involved in forming mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM), which is considered to be the main mechanism of OM stabilization in the soil. In this chapter we explore the complex interactions between OM and minerals and the role of the microbes in such interactions. Different procedures to isolate MAOM and various characterization techniques are discussed.
