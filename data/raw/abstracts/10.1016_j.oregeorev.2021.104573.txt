The Maoping large Pb-Zn deposit is located in the Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou Metallogenic Province (SYGMP), southwestern China, hosting more than 3 mt Pb and Zn minerals, with 140Â t associated Ge. This study uses numerical simulation methods to explore the key factors of the mineralizing system that formed the Maoping deposit which traditional analytical methods cannot easily identify, answering questions about the spatial distribution of galena and giving information for future resource exploration within the Maoping district. This Study reveals and highlights the practical value of numerical modeling in quantitatively researching the ore-forming processes of mineral deposits and how this knowledge can be used in future geological research and mineral exploration. Our model interlinks heat transfer, pressure (without deformation process), fluid-flow, and material migration during the mineralizing processes and indicates the presence of a temperature anomaly, location of fluid convergence and the spatial distribution of Pb2+ that match the known distribution of mineralization. We also analyze the whole process and find the key factors which control the spatial distribution of galena, answering the question why there is mineralization with economic value in the northwest limb and none in the southeast limb of the Maoping anticline. All these data can be used in future geological research to gain insights into the ore-forming system that formed the Maoping Pb-Zn deposit as well as other hydrothermal mineralizing systems in the SYGMP.
