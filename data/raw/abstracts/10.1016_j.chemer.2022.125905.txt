In this paper, Bi-dimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) and bi-dimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition (BEEMD) are compared to identify geochemical anomalies using a case study from Cu polymetallic mineralization district in southwestern Fujian province (China). The results showed that (1) Both BEMD and BEEMD were useful for decomposing non-linear and non-stationary geochemical data into a set of simple Bi-intrinsic functions (BIMFs), however, there is a drawback of 2D mode mixing in BEMD, and the serious mode mixing can lead to incorrect geological interpretation; (2) BEEMD can give more robust and reliable results than BEMD, making the data easier to interpret; and (3) the BIMFs and the residue obtained by BEEMD can be combined into new components, which can represent geochemical anomalies, unwanted noise and the background of the study area.
