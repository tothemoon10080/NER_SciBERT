In the present study, advanced oxidation processes, UV/H2O2, UV/O3, and UV/H2O2/O3 have been applied to bleach and degrade organic dye C.I. Reactive Red 45 in water solution. Influence of pH and hydrogen peroxide dosage on process efficiency was investigated. The rate of color removal was studied by measuring the absorbance at the characteristic wavelength while mineralization rates were obtained on the basis of total organic carbon (TOC) and adsorbable organic halides (AOX) measurements. Complete bleaching was achieved by all applied processes after 60min while the maximal mineralization extent depended on the reaction conditions for each of the processes. It has been found that UV/H2O2/O3 process was the most efficient with 61.1% TOC removal and 72.0% AOX removal, respectively, achieved after a 1-h treatment. Time required for complete mineralization of RR45 by UV/H2O2 and UV/H2O2/O3 processes was determined as well.
