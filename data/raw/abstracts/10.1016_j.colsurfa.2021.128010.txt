Ethyl isobutyl xanthogenic acetate (EIBXAC) was used as a novel collector in the flotation of secondary copper sulfide minerals owing to its ability to separate copper and sulfur. The collectivity and selectivity mechanisms of this novel collector were investigated using single-mineral and artificial mixed-mineral tests, combined with adsorption tests, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) tests, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results of the flotation indicated that EIBXAC had a better collecting effect than ammonium dibutyl dithiophosphate (ADD) on covellite and digenite, which had an insignificant effect on pyrite. The artificial mixed-mineral experiment indicated that EIBXAC could improve the grade of the copper concentrate while maintaining the same recovery, it had higher efficiency and selectivity. Based on the results of the adsorption and FTIR tests, the adsorption capacities of EIBXAC on the surfaces of covellite, digenite, and pyrite were quite different: Cu-S bonds were formed on covellite and digenite, and Fe-O bonds were formed on pyrite, which was also verified that EIBXAC was chemically adsorbed on the mineral surface. DFT calculations indicated that the adsorption capacity of EIBXAC for covellite and digenite was stronger than that of ADD, which had a weaker adsorption capacity for pyrite. This study can provide theoretical guidance for the application of EIBXAC.
