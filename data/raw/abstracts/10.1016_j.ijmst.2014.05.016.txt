Selection of crusher required a great deal of design based on the mining plan and operation input. Selection of the best primary crusher from all of available primary crushers is a Multi-Criterion Decision Making (MCDM) problem. In this paper, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was used to selection of the best primary crusher for Golegohar Iron Mine in Iran. For this reason, gyratory, double toggle jaw, single toggle jaw, high speed roll crusher, low speed sizer, impactor, hammer mill and feeder breaker crushers were considered as alternatives and capacity, feed size, product size, rock compressive strength, abrasion index and mobility of crusher were considered as criteria. As a result of our study, the gyratory crusher was offered as the best primary crusher for the studied mine.
