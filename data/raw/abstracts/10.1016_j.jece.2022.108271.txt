The adsorption of naphthalene on montmorillonite (Mon)–humic acid (HA) and chlorite (Chl)–HA complexes often occurs in environments with high concentrations of Fe(III) loading. But the functions of Fe(III) in naphthalene adsorption on Mon-HA and Chl-HA complexes are unclear. In this study, mineral–organic complexes of HA and the common minerals Mon and Chl were prepared for studying the mechanisms and characteristics of naphthalene adsorption on Mon, Chl and HA complexes in the presence of Fe(III). The results showed that
                        
                     for Mon–Fe–HA, as organic matter contents (

                     . And Fe(III) had different effects on the adsorption of naphthalene on Mon–Fe–HA and Chl–Fe–HA, which is due to the differences in the structure, pore structure and functional groups of Mon and Chl. These findings provide a basis for accurately assessing the adsorption of such pollutants on mineral–organic complexes with minerals.
