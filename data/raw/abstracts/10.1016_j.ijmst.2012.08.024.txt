Tongting coal (TTC) was exhaustively extracted with carbon disulfide and N-melthy-2-pyrolidinone (CS2/NMP) mixed solvents to afford brown particles of extract, which was characterized with proximate analyzer, transmission electron microscope (TEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The results show that the nanometer particles of extract, which were free of ash, are superfine and super-clean with tract content of 0.02% A
                     d and particles size of about 100â€“150nm. TTC and extract were then subject to oxidation with H2O2 and oxidation products were subsequently analyzed with FTIR and gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (GC/MS). The results show that extract is more reactive with H2O2 in comparison to TTC and richer in oxygen-containing species including phenols, alcohols, ethers, esters, carboxylic acids and anhydrides.
