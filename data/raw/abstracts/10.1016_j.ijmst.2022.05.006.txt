It has become an inevitable trend of human development to seek resources from the deep underground. However, rock encountered in deep underground engineering is usually in an anisotropic stress state (σ
                     1>σ>σ
                     3) due to the influences of geological structures and engineering disturbances. It is therefore essential to study the mechanical, seepage, and dynamic disaster behaviors of deep rock under true triaxial stress to ensure the safe operation of deep rock engineering and the efficient exploitation of deep resources. In recent years, experimental techniques and research on true triaxial rock mechanics have achieved fruitful results that have promoted the rapid development of deep rock mechanics; thus, it is necessary to systematically review and summarize these developments. This work first introduced several typical true triaxial testing apparatus and then reviewed the corresponding research progress on rock deformation, strength, failure mode, brittleness, and energy as well as the 3D volumetric fracturing (dynamic disaster) properties of deep rocks under true triaxial stress. Then, several commonly used true triaxial rock strength criteria and their applicability, the permeability characteristics and mathematical models of deep reservoir rocks, and the disaster-causing processes and mechanisms of disturbed volumetric fracturing (rockburst, compound dynamic disasters) in deep rock engineering were described. This work may provide an essential reference for addressing the true triaxial rock mechanics issues involved in deep rock engineering, especially regarding the stability of surrounding rock at depth, disaster prevention and control, and oil and gas exploitation.
