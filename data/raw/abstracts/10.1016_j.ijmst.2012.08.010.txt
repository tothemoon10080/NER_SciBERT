Many researchers in academia and industries are interested in reducing particle sizes from few sub-micrometers to nano-meter levels. These nano-particles find application in several areas including ceramics, paints, cosmetics, microelectronics, sensors, textiles and biomedical, etc. This article reviews the present state of the art for solid state synthesis of mineral nano-particles by wet milling, including their operating variables such as ball size, solid mass fraction and suspension stability. This article concludes and recommends with a critical discussion of nano-particles synthesis and a few common strategies to overcome stability issues.
