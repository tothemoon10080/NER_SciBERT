In this paper a comprehensive review is presented of risk assessment techniques adopted in the mining industry worldwide; those techniques applied in other hazardous industries and potential techniques which are robust, mature and holistic and can be implemented for the Indian mining industry in future to enhance workplace safety are also presented. Findings from the review are indicative of the fact that socio-technical complexity of industrial systems has increased. Recent developments in the area of risk management highlight the need for implementation of the latest robust techniques of risk assessment in the mining sector. In consideration of the present scenario, the development of a model for risk analysis having an interface between hazard identification and risk assessment, along with an interface between risk assessment and accident causation to predict if an accident will occur under given conditions, has become dire necessity. This will increase hazard awareness and enable mine management to select and prioritize problem areas and identify safety system weaknesses in both underground and surface mining. This will ultimately help decision makers, risk analysts and safety managers make a major contribution in the development of workplace safety with a near-to-zero accident rate.
