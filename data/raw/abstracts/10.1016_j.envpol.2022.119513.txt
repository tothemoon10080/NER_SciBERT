The use of membrane-based technology has evolved into an important strategy for supplying freshwater from seawater and wastewater to overcome the problems of water scarcity around the world. However, the presence of natural organic matter (NOM), including humic substances affects the performance of the process. Here, we present a systematic report on the mineralization of humic acid (HA), as a model for NOM, in high concentration of salts using the ultraviolet light-activated peroxymonosulfate (UV/PMS) system as a potential alternative for HA elimination during membrane-based seawater desalination and water treatment processes. Effects of various parameters such as PMS concentration, solution type, pH, anions, and anion-cation matrix on HA mineralization were assessed. The results show that 100%, 78% and 58% of HA (2 mg/L TOC) were mineralized with rate constants of 0.085 min−1, 0.0073 min−1, and 0.0041 min−1 after 180 min reaction time at pH 7 when 0.5 mM PMS was used in deionized water, sodium chloride solution (35,000 ppm) and synthetic seawater, respectively. The reduced efficiency under saline conditions was attributed to the presence of anions in the system that acted as sulfate and hydroxyl radicals’ scavengers. Furthermore, the safety of the treated synthetic seawater was evaluated by analyzing the residual transformed products. Overall, pretreatment with the UV/PMS system mitigated fouling on the RO membrane.
