In order to control asymmetric floor heave in deep rock roadways and deformation around the surrounding rock mass after excavation, in this paper we discuss the failure mechanism and coupling control countermeasures using the finite difference method (FLAC3D) combined with comparative analysis and typical engineering application at Xingcun coal mine. It is indicated by the analysis that the simple symmetric support systems used in the past led to destruction of the deep rock roadway from the key zone and resulted in the deformation of asymmetric floor heave in the roadway. Suitable reinforced support countermeasures are proposed to reduce the deformation of the floor heave and the potential risk during mining. The application shows that the present support technology can be used to better environmental conditions. The countermeasures of asymmetric coupling support can not only effectively reduce the discrepancy deformation at the key area of the surrounding rock mass, but also effectively control floor heave, which helps realize the integration of support and maintain the stability of the deep rock roadways at Xingcun coal mine.
