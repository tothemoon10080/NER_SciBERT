A series of illite/bismuth-rich bismuth oxyiodide photocatalytic composites (IBCs) were successfully synthesized via an easy in-situ hydrolysis and calcination process. The type of bismuth-rich bismuth oxyiodide materials can be precisely adjusted by controlling the calcination temperature. Among them, T500 (illite@BiOI calcinated at 500 ℃) is a composite of illite-supported Bi4O5I2-Bi5O7I heterojunction, which exhibits superior removal efficiency of 94% toward bisphenol A (BPA) within 120 min and 73% on tetracycline hydrochloride (TH) in 60 min under visible light (λ > 420 nm) irradiation, corresponding 69% and 46% of TOC are thoroughly decomposed respectively, manifesting the outstanding mineralization efficiencies of T500. This excellent photocatalytic performance should be attributed to the highly dispersed Bi4O5I2-Bi5O7I hybrid nanosheets which chemically bonded on layered illite can expose more abundant active sites to absorb O2 and capture charges. Furthermore, the in-situ tight binding interface between Bi4O5I2 and Bi5O7I can generate a strong interface electric field (IEF) to spatially propel the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. This work proposes a quick and simple preparation method for potentially powerful heterojunction photocatalysts based on affordable and natural clay supports.
