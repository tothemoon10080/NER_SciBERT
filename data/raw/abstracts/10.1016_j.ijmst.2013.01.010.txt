Thickeners are important units for water recovery in various industries. In this study, a semi-industrial pilot plant thickener similar to the tailing thickener of the Sarcheshmeh Copper Mine was simulated by CFD modeling. The population balance was used to describe the particle aggregation and breakup. In this population balance, 15 particle sizes categories were considered. The Eulerian–Eulerian approach with standard k–ε turbulence model was applied to describe two phases of slurry flow in the thickener under steady-state condition. The simulation results have been compared with the experimental measurements to validate the accuracy of the CFD modeling. After checking the numerical results, the effect of important parameters such as, feed flow rate, solid percentage in the feed, and solid particle size on the thickener performance was studied. The thickener residence time distribution were obtained by the modeling and also compared with the experimental data. Finally, the effects of feedwell feeding on the average diameter of aggregate and turbulent intensity were evaluated.
