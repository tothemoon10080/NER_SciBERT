The interactions of soil components have profound impacts on the speciation, bioavailability and transformation of heavy metals. However, these interactions have not been well included in multi-surface model (MSM) as most of the models adopt component additive method. Here, an incubation experiment was conducted with three contrasting soils spiked with 200 mg/kg Pb and rice straw to investigate the impact of mineral-organic interactions on Pb speciation and to validate the MSM for Pb in soils. With the aid of chemical extraction and instrumental analysis (XANES and SEM-EDS), the results show that metal oxides and soil organic matter are the main scavengers for Pb, accounting for the stabilization of exogenous Pb by ∼ 40% − 80% and ∼ 13% − 30%, respectively. The accumulation of the most stable residual Pb was driven by Fe/Al oxides, which was fostered by organic matter through the formation of amorphous Fe/Al oxides. Unexpectedly, the introduction of straw promoted the activation of metal oxides and the competition from Fe/Al/Ca ions reduced the binding of Pb by soil organic matter. Simulation of organic-Fe/Al/Ca interactions largely improved the accuracy of the MSM model results for the prediction of Pb speciation distribution. Overall, this study highlights that mineral-organic interactions play important role in the stabilization of exogenous Pb in soils, while incorporate of these interactions into MSM is recommended in future heavy metal studies.
