This study investigated the reparative process of mechanically exposed pulps capped with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). Maxillary first molars of 8-week-old rats were MTA-capped for 1–14 days, and 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine–labeled proliferating cells and immunoreactivity for nestin and osteopontin were analyzed. MTA capping caused mild necrotic changes followed by progressive new matrix formation and calcified bridging. Proliferating cells peaked at 3 days when matrix formation was inconspicuous. Nestin-expressing cells appeared at 3 days, were arranged beneath the newly formed matrix at 5 days, and showed odontoblast-like morphology by 14 days. Osteopontin immunoreactivity was detected just beneath the necrotic area after 1 day. These findings suggest that pulpal responses to MTA capping involve proliferation and migration of progenitors followed by their differentiation into odontoblast-like cells, a mechanism basically similar to those to calcium hydroxide. Osteopontin might play a triggering role in initiation of the pulpal reparative process.
