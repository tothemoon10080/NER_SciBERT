Background
                  and Purposes: The terminology “immune boost-up” was the talk of the topic in this Covid-19 pandemic. A significant number of the people took initiative to increase the body's defense capacity through boosting up immunity worldwide. Considering this, the study was designed to explain the natural products, vitamins and mineral that were proved by clinical trail as immunity enhancer.

                  Result
                  A well-defined immune cells response provide a-well functioning defense system for the human physiological system. Cells of the immune system must require adequate stimulation so that these cells can prepare themselves competent enough to fight against any unintended onslaught. Several pharmacologically active medicinal plants and plants derived probiotics or micronutrients have played a pivotal role in enhancing the immune boost-up process. Their role has been well established from the previous study. Immune stimulating cells, especially cells of acquired immunity are closely associated with the immune-boosting up process because all the immunological reactions and mechanisms are mediated through these cells.
               
                  Conclusion
                  This article highlighted the mechanism of action of different natural products, vitamins and mineral in boosting up the immunity of the human body and strengthening the body's defense system. Therefore, it is recommended that until the specific immune-boosting drugs are available in pharma markets, anyone can consider the mentioned products as dietary supplements to boost up the immunity.
