Volatile elements and compounds found in extra-terrestrial environments are often the target of In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) studies. Although water and hydroxide are most commonly the focus of these studies as they can be used for propellant and human consumption; we instead focus on the possible exploitation of sulfur and how it could be utilized to produce building materials on the Moon, Mars and Asteroids. We describe the physical and chemical pathways for extracting sulfur from native sulfide minerals, manufacturing sulfuric acid in situ, and using the produced acid to dissolve native silicate minerals. The final products of this process, which we call the Silicate-Sulfuric Acid Process (SSAP), include iron metal, silica, oxygen and metal oxides, all of which are crucial in the scope of a sustainable, space-based economy. Although our proposed methodology requires an initial investment of water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, we show that all of these volatiles are recovered and reused in order to repeat the process. We calculate the product yield from this process if it were enacted on the lunar highlands, lunar mare, Mars, as well as an array of asteroid types.
