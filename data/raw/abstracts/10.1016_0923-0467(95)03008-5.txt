Developments in on-line measurement instrumentation now allow direct observation of the behaviour of fluids inside mineral separation equipment. This offers the possibility to acquire process data to enable models to be devised, to verify theoretical computational fluid dynamics predictions and to control processes. The main tomographic sensing methods are reviewed. Examples of the implementation of some electrical sensing methods are illustrated.
