The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of removing hexavalent chromium using grape leaf, carbon from grape leaf, and barberry root and then comparing these natural adsorbents with a mineral adsorbent (clinoptilolite zeolite). In this study, the adsorption process was altered by changing pH, contact time, the amount of adsorbent weight, the initial concentration of chromium, and temperature. The optimal contact time for removal efficiency of grape leaf, carbon, barberry root, and clinoptilolite zeolite was obtained equal to 60, 90, 90, and 120 min, respectively. The best removal efficiency for grape leaf, carbon, barberry root, and clinoptilolite zeolite occurred when their concentrations were 0.3, 0.1, 0.5, and 2 g, respectively. The results also indicated the maximum absorption capacity was achieved through grape leaf (98.7%) and zeolite (99.8%) at 22 °C, carbon (85.7%) at 40 °C, and barberry root (97.8%) at 50 °C.
