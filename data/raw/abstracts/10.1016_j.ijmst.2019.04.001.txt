Based on the problems caused by many oxygen-containing functional groups and poor floatability on the surface of low rank coal, the characteristics of low rank coal were analyzed systematically by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The bubble-particle induction time was used to determine the characterization of the bubble-particle attachment, and the bubble-particle attachment of low rank coal modified by soaking the coal samples in an acid or alkaline solution was analyzed. The floatability of the modified coal surface was verified by flotation tests. The results show that the particle size of 0.125–0.074 mm of the coal sample exhibited better bubble-particle attachment characteristics. The small bubble, the larger approach velocity of bubble and the larger bubble deformation were more helpful to enhance the bubble-particle attachment. For an acid solution, the smaller the pH was and the longer the soaking time was, the better the floatability of the coal sample and the higher the combustible material recovery were. The combustible material recovery of low rank coal was increased to 78.79% by soaking the sample in an acid solution of pH = 0 for 180 min. On the contrary there was a best concentration for the alkaline solution.
