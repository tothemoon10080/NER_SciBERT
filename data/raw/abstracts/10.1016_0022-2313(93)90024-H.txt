In this work we study the spectroscopic behaviour of certain organic polar molecules in solution versus their surrounding environment, resolving their fluorescence spectra into some of their emission bands. The results obtained are applied to the characterization of the degradation process in mineral oils. In particular, data obtained for Vestan oil with N-methylindole as polar probe are presented.
