The causes of variation in the milk mineral profile of dairy cattle during the first phase of lactation were studied under the hypothesis that the milk mineral profile partially reflects the animals' metabolic status. Correlations between the minerals and the main milk constituents (i.e., protein, fat, and lactose percentages), and their associations with the cows' metabolic status indicators were explored. The metabolic status indicators (MET) that we used were blood energy-protein metabolites [nonesterified fatty acids, Î²-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), glucose, cholesterol, creatinine, and urea], and liver ultrasound measurements (predicted triacylglycerol liver content, portal vein area, portal vein diameter and liver depth). Milk and blood samples, and ultrasound measurements were taken from 295 Holstein cows belonging to 2 herds and in the first 120 d in milk (DIM). Milk mineral contents were determined by ICP-OES; these were considered the response variable and analyzed through a mixed model which included DIM, parity, milk yield, and MET as fixed effects, and the herd/date as a random effect. The MET traits were divided in tertiles. The results showed that milk protein was positively associated with body condition score (BCS) and glucose, and negatively associated with BHB blood content; milk fat was positively associated with BHB content; milk lactose was positively associated with BCS; and Ca, P, K and S were the minerals with the greatest number of associations with the cows' energy indicators, particularly BCS, predicted triacylglycerol liver content, glucose, BHB and urea. We conclude that the protein, fat, lactose, and mineral contents of milk partially reflect the metabolic adaptation of cows during lactation and within 120 DIM. Variations in the milk mineral profile were consistent with changes in the major milk constituents and the metabolic status of cows.
