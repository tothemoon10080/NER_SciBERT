The Matachel Basin is a tectono-stratigraphic unit of Ossa-Morena Zone (southern Iberian Massif) that encompasses an Upper Tournaisian – Viséan basaltic sequence, generated by effusive and explosive eruptions in a shallow submarine setting. A collection of 23 basaltic and gabbroic samples were selected for detailed petrographic descriptions, which included a mineral chemistry characterization by means of Electron Microprobe analysis in 9 rock samples. In this contribution a total of 501 mineral chemical data are presented, which correspond to plagioclase (208 analysis), clinopyroxene (202 analysis), amphibole (64 analysis), opaque minerals (18 analysis), and alkali feldspar (9 analysis). According to mineral classification diagrams analyzed rock samples are composed by albite-labradorite (An01-66), augite (Wo31–41En32–49Fs7–22), magnesiohornblende, ferrohornblende, ferropargasite, titanian magnesiohastingsite, orthoclase (Or93–97), titanomagnetite, and ilmenite. Presented dataset provides a robust information of the nature of the outpouring lava emissions in shallow-marine intra-continental basins, and would enhance a better understanding of eruptive dynamics in this type of tectonic settings.
