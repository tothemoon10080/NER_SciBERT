Quantifying the water and mineral losses in feces is essential to determine the optimal composition of oral rehydration solutions (ORS) for diarrheic animals. In a randomized complete block design, this study evaluated water, mineral, and blood acid-base balance of calves with naturally occurring diarrhea receiving ORS or a placebo. On d0, 45 calves (age: mean ± SD, 18 ± 3.2 d) were selected based on the presence of visual signs of diarrhea, such as dirty tail or wet feces, along with clinical symptoms evaluated by measuring the skin turgor and the degree of enophthalmos. On d1, calves were divided into blocks of 3 animals based on blood base excess (BE) measured at 0900h, and within each block, calves were randomly assigned to one of 3 treatments (15 calves per treatment) including: 1) a hypertonic ORS (HYPER: Na+ = 110 mmol/L; 370 mOsm/kg; SID3 = 60 mEq/L), 2) a hypotonic ORS with low Na+ (HYPO: Na+ = 77 mmol/L; 278 mOsm/kg; SID3 = 71 mEq/L), and 3) a placebo consisting of lukewarm water with 5 g/L of whey powder (CON). Milk replacer (MR) was fed through teat buckets twice daily at 0630h and 1700h in 2 equally sized meals of 2.5L from d 1 to 3 and of 3.0L on d 4 and 5. Treatments consisting of 2.0L solutions were administered between milk meals from d 1 to 3 at 1200h and 2100h through teat buckets. Refusals of MR and treatments were recorded daily, and blood samples were collected from the jugular vein once daily at arrival in the afternoon of d0 and at 0900h from d1 to 5. Urine and feces were collected quantitatively over a 48-h period from 1200h on d1 to 1200h on d3, and a representative sample of each 24h period was stored. In addition, the volume of extracellular fluid was evaluated on d2 by postprandial sampling over a 4h period relative to the injection of sodium thiosulfate at 1300h. Total daily fluid intake from d1 to 3 was greater in HYPER (LSM ± SEM, 8.9 ± 0.36 L/d) and HYPO (7.8 ± 0.34 L/d) than in CON (6.6 ± 0.34 L/d). This resulted in a greater water balance in calves receiving ORS (59.6 ± 6.28 g/kg BW/d vs. 39.6 ± 6.08 g/kg BW/d). Fecal Na+ losses were greater in HYPER than in the other treatments (81 ± 12.0 mg/kg BW/d vs. 24 ± 11.8 mg/kg BW/d). Blood pH was higher in HYPO (7.41 ± 0.016) than CON (7.35 ± 0.016) over the 5 monitoring days, whereas HYPER (7.37 ± 0.017) did not differ with other treatments. In this experimental model, diarrheic calves were likely unable to absorb the high Na+ load from HYPER, resulting in greater Na+ losses in feces, which might have impaired the alkalinizing capacity of HYPER. In contrast, HYPO significantly sustained acid-base balance compared with CON, whereas HYPER did not. This suggests that low tonicity ORS with a high SID are more suitable for diarrheic calves.
