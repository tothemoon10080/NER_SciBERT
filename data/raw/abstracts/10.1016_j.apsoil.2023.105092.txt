Background and aims
                  Endophytic bacteria (EB) commonly exist in plants and are recognized to increase plant growth especially under adverse environmental conditions. We here demonstrate that EB Bacillus cereus can accelerate the decomposition of plant litter and enhance nutrient availability for plant growth.
               
                  Methods
                  First, we obtained plant litter with and without EB inoculation using a model plant Arabidopsis thaliana in a microcosmic experiment. After that we conducted a litter decomposition experiment to investigate the effect of EB on mass loss, phosphorus availability, and soil microbial community composition. We further evaluated wheat (Triticum aestivum) growth using soils amended with either EB-inoculated litter or with litter alone.
               
                  Results
                  Inoculation of EB significantly increased the mass loss of A. thaliana litter in the second to fourth month of decomposition, elevated the activity of alkaline phosphatase in the first month of decomposition, and increased soil available phosphorus at the end of decomposition. Illumina MiSeq sequencing and structural equation models also showed that EB inoculation had pronounced impact on the bacterial diversity and composition in soil. Finally, the wheat growth was significantly promoted in the litter with EB decomposition system.
               
                  Conclusion
                  EB affected host after life effect likely through accelerating the release of P from plant litter and regulating the composition of soil microorganisms, improving nutrient utilization efficiency in a terrestrial ecosystem.
