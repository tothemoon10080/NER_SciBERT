Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is responsible for the recovery of nitrogen in environment. Specific bacteria carry out the fixing of molecular nitrogen (N2) into bioavailable complexes for cellular consumption. N2 is reduced in many electron transfer reactions throughout the process of biological nitrogen fixation, ensuing the production of ammonia (NH3). In all nitrogen-fixing organisms this reduction of N2 to NH3 is catalyzed through the nitrogenase enzyme complex. It is an ATP-reliant and a tremendously energy expending process. Like any other natural process, the efficacy of BNF is influenced by several environmental elements, such as pH, water availability, heat and essential mineral nutrients. This chapter identifies the function of several mineral nutrients in BNF as a clean and more reasonable method to recover lost soil quality. Along with water and carbon dioxide, plants require essential minerals for proper growth. A proper understanding of the function of mineral nutrients in BNF is important to ensure adequate and nutritive food stock to the populations.
