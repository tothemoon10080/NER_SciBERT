Crystallization fouling, or mineral scaling, is fundamental to various surfaces in energy and environmental applications. This paper considers, for the first time, a systematic investigation of scaling of nonwetting aluminum and brass surfaces relative to their bare counterparts. Metallic surfaces with a range of nonwetting characteristics from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic and lubricant infused surfaces were fabricated using a facile etching method. Systematic dynamic flow scaling experiments are conducted on the six different surface types at three flow levels and two temperature levels. The interactive effects of the different parameters are analyzed relative to their correspondence to the nucleation theory. The study reveals that nonwetting metallic superhydrophobic or hydrophobic surfaces reduce fouling by over 50% compared to bare counterparts. Lubricant infused metallic surfaces demonstrate superior anti-scaling performance by over 60% and up to 90% fouling reduction. The study is the first to present fundamental insights into the engineering and anti-scaling performance of nonwetting brass and aluminum surfaces.
