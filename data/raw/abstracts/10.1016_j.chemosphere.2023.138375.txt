31P Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (31P NMR) is an important analytical tool for identifying and quantifying phosphorus-based compounds in aquatic environments. However, the precipitation method typically used for analyzing phosphorus species via 31P NMR has limited application. To expand the scope of the method and apply it to highly mineralized rivers and lakes worldwide, we present an optimization technique that employs H resin to assist phosphorus (P) enrichment in highly mineralized lake water. To explore how to reduce analysis interference from salt in highly mineralized water and improve the accuracy of P analysis using 31P NMR, we conducted case studies on Lake Hulun and Qing River. This study aimed to increase the efficiency of phosphorus extraction in highly mineralized water samples by using H resin and optimizing key parameters. The optimization procedure included determining the enriched water volume, H resin treatment time, AlCl3 addition amount, and precipitation time. The final recommended optimization enrichment procedure involves treating 10 L of filtered water sample with 150 g of Milli-Q water-washed H resin for 30 s, adjusting the pH of the treated sample to 6–7, adding 1.6 g of AlCl3, stirring the mixture, and allowing the solution to settle for 9 h to collect the flocculated precipitate. The precipitate was then extracted with 30 mL of 1 M NaOH +0.05 M DETA extraction solution at 25 °C for 16 h, and the supernatant was separated and lyophilized. The lyophilized sample was redissolved in 1 mL of 1 M NaOH +0.05 M EDTA. This optimized analytical method using 31P NMR effectively identified phosphorus species in highly mineralized natural waters and can be applied to other highly mineralized lake waters globally.
