The Mineral Processing Material Balance problem and the available computer packages for automated solution are outlined. Current solution techniques require considerable storage space to solve most practical problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel implementation based on existing formulations which allows large problems to be solved on a personal computer. A prototype package of this approach is discussed in detail and comparisons are made with an existing package on standard test problems. The treatment of the special cases which arise in material balance problems are discussed and test examples are included.
