The use of neural networks in the control and monitoring of two minerals processing operations is described. The application of nets, coupled with a novel control scheme, to the control of hydrocyclone classification proves most successful. The neural net is used to develop a model of cyclone operation, allowing model based control to be performed. The monitoring of adsorbent activity in a CIP adsorption plant is also described. A neural network can be trained to monitor carbon activity on-line, using only measurements which are currently practical to perform. The success of this approach depended on the use of physically meaningful grouping of variables as network inputs.
