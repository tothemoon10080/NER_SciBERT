The physicochemical interactions between soil organic carbon (SOC) and minerals are important for the long-term stabilization of OC. However, in the dynamic landscape, the mechanisms of OC stabilized by different types of minerals remains unclear. Herein, we investigated the effects of erosion and deposition on the distribution of SOC pools and the interaction of OC with different minerals in an agricultural Mollisol landscape. We quantified the SOC fractions using a physically separated technique and measured the polyvalent cation bound-OC using a mineral reduction release method. Sorption experiments and specific mineral surface area (SSA) were determined. Results show that 77.6%−96.9% of SOC was mineral-associated OC (MAOC). MAOC contents in the topsoil (0–20 cm) and subsoil (60–80 cm) of the depositional sites were 1.17 and 1.64 times higher than those in the topsoil and subsoil of the eroding sites, respectively. A higher MAOC content in the depositional sites suggests that MAOC in the middle slope migrates directly to the downslope through erosion, and subsequent depositional and burial processes promote OC interactions with minerals. Furthermore, Fe and Al oxides were the main minerals that stabilized OC compounds at each slope, while Ca played a vital role in OC interactions in the depositional sites. The Fe- and Al-bound OC (Fe/Al-OC) showed higher aromaticity, humification, and molecular weight than Ca-OC and bulk soil dissolved OC, which remained unaffected by erosion and deposition. These OC interactions with Fe/Al increased the chemical structural stability of SOC. Furthermore, the depositional sites showed the highest MAOC contents, MAOC loading, BET-C constant, adsorption capacity, and the lowest SSA covered by SOC (%SSASOC-covered). These results indicate that depositional sites have the highest capacities for OC sequestration. Based on these results, the deposition or burying of eroding OC plays a key role in stabilizing soil OC.
