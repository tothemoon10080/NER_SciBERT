Although remarkable progresses have been achieved in the exploration of new and efficient catalytic systems for efficient degradation of estriol, there are only very few available reports providing high mineralization of estriol. Hence, it is still a serious challenge to develop the novel and efficient methods for enhanced degradation and mineralization of estriol due to its serious threat to environment and human health. Herein, this study proposes a series of ZrO2 modified manganese oxide octahedral molecular sieve (ZrO2/OMS-2) nanocomposites as efficient catalysts for enhanced degradation and mineralization of estriol via PMS activation at 30 °C. Among them, ZrO2/OMS-2-27% provided the highest degradation efficiency (95%) and mineralization degrees (70.1%), which exceeded most reported catalytic systems, in the catalytic degradation of estriol. These quenching tests and EPR analysis had confirmed that O2•- and 1O2 were primary reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the ZrO2/OMS-2-27%/PMS system, contrary to the OMS-2/PMS system for which SO4•- and OH• are primary ROS. This might be due to the abundant O-containing surface functional groups of ZrO2/OMS-2-27%. This work not only provides a facile and high-efficiency methodology for the construction of Mn-based nanomaterial, but also proposes a new and efficient nano-catalyst for estriol removal.
