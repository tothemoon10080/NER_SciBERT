In Ayurveda, Curcuma caesia Roxb. (Zingiberaceae) plants are used as medicines and nutritional supplements. Because of its variety of phytochemicals and beneficial nutritional properties, the native flora species C. caesia has been subjected to current research work. This study performed a preliminary phytochemical screening, physicochemical studies, proximate analysis, and element identification in C. caesia rhizomes using standard techniques. Preliminary phytochemical screening revealed that plants have a variety of secondary metabolites like curcumine, coumarin, carbohydrates, and phenol present in each extract. The findings proved that C. caesia has a greater ratio of crude protein, crude fiber, crude fat, and carbohydrates. The results also revealed a rich supply of mineral elements, including Fe, K, Co, Na, Ca, Mg, P, and Al, which emphasized its good nutritional value. This research would help to identify and formulate pharmaceutical medications as well as quality control aspects.
