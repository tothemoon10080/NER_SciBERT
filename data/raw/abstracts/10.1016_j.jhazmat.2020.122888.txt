Nanoarchitecture of hybrids materials based on clay minerals as nano building blocks for the environmental remediation is summarized with the emphasis on the utilization of layered clay minerals, especially smectite group of clay minerals, as nano building blocks for designing functional nanostructures for the adsorption of molecular contaminants from the environments. Smectites are well-known adsorbents of cationic contaminants, while surface modification of smectites with organoammonium ions has given hydrophobic and microporous characters to uptake nonionic organic contaminants from environments. Not only on the designed interactions between adsorbent-adsorbate for efficient and higher capacity adsorption, the states of the adsorbed nonionic organic compounds have been altered and varied by the modification of smectites as shown by the controlled release and specific catalytic reactions. The organically modified clays are classified from the nanoarchitecture, and the functions derived from the nanoarchitectures are discussed based on the structure-property relationship.
