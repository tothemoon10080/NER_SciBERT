Microbial induced calcium carbonate precipitation technology was proposed as a novel and environmentally friendly approach to strengthen the surface layer of cement-based materials in this study. The effects of microbial additives on the content of Ca(OH)2 and CaCO3 and the porosity at different depths of surface layer were studied. The relative efflorescence rate of cement mortar samples mixed microbial additives were studied. Combined with observation the surface microstructure and mineralization products, the modification mechanism of microbial mineralization at the surface layer of cement-based materials was analyzed. The results showed the porosity and relative efflorescence rate reduced due to the microorganisms. And the content of Ca(OH)2 decreased and CaCO3 increased in the surface layer of cement paste samples continuously, with the increase of microbial additives (dosage <0.4%). Due to the microbial mineralization, the reaction of Ca2+ in the pore solution with CO2 from atmosphere could be accelerated to form calcium carbonate. The shape characteristics of crystals were spherical aggregate and stacked polyhedron. The relative efflorescence rate of the sample surface was reduced by microbial mineralization because of the consumption of Ca(OH)2, which was the main substance causing efflorescence. Besides, the mineralization products filled the pores in the surface layer, reduced the porosity and compacted the surface layer of the sample.
