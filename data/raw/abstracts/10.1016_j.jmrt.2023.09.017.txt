Bauxite residue, which is a solid waste generated during the production of alumina, contains significant amounts of iron (Fe) and titanium (Ti) resources. The large-scale utilization of bauxite residue has become an urgent concern from both an environmental and resource perspective. In this study, a calculation of phase diagram (Calphad) was conducted to analyze the changes in mineral phases during the direct reduction process of both the current and reductive Bayer bauxite residue. Additionally, a comparison experiment was performed to investigate the enrichment and separation characteristics of iron and titanium minerals. The results indicated that during the carbon thermal reduction process, titanium existed as CaTiO3 and Na-Al-Si-Ti molten phase slag in the current and reductive Bayer bauxite residue, respectively. Furthermore, NaFeO2 was observed in the latter slag phase, which facilitated the migration and reduction of iron-containing minerals. The reductive Bayer bauxite residue was carbon thermal reduced for 1 h at a temperature of 1200 °C, with the addition of 7.5% Na2CO3. Following grinding and separation under a magnetic field strength of 0.08 T, the iron grade of the concentrate, iron recovery, and TiO2 grade in the tailing increased to 95.30%, 98.40%, and 50.50%, respectively. This was in comparison to the bauxite residue from current Bayer digestion, which showed values of 78.90%, 87.18%, and 14.87% under the same conditions. The findings of this work contribute to the potential utilization of iron and titanium present in bauxite residue from a modified Bayer digestion process.
