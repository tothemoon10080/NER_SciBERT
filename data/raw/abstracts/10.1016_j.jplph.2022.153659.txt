Phytoplasmas are sieve-elements restricted wall-less, pleomorphic pathogenic microorganisms causing devastating damage to over 700 plant species worldwide. The invasion of sieve elements by phytoplasmas has several consequences on nutrient transport and metabolism, anyway studies about changes of the mineral-nutrient profile following phytoplasma infections are scarce and offer contrasting results. Here, we examined changes in macro- and micronutrient concentration in tomato plant upon ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma solani’ infection. To investigate possible effects of ‘Ca. P. solani’ infection on mineral element allocation, the mineral elements were separately analysed in leaf midrib, leaf lamina and root. Moreover, we focused our analysis on the transcriptional regulation of genes encoding trans-membrane transporters of mineral nutrients. To this aim, a manually curated inventory of differentially expressed genes encoding transporters in tomato leaf midribs was mined from the transcriptional profile of healthy and infected tomato leaf midribs. Results highlighted changes in ion homeostasis in the host plant, and significant modulations at transcriptional level of genes encoding ion transporters and channels.
