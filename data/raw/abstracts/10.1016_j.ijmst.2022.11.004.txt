Understanding the size effect exhibited by the fracture mechanism of anisotropic geomaterials is important for engineering practice. In this study, the anisotropic features of the nominal strength, apparent fracture toughness, effective fracture energy and fracture process zone (FPZ) size of geomaterials were first analyzed by systematic size effect fracture experiments. The results showed that the nominal strength and the apparent fracture toughness decreased with increasing bedding plane inclination angle. The larger the specimen size was, the smaller the nominal strength and the larger the apparent fracture toughness was. When the bedding inclination angle increased from 0° to 90°, the effective fracture energy and the effective FPZ size both first decreased and then increased within two complex variation stages that were bounded by the 45° bedding angle. Regardless of the inherent anisotropy of geomaterials, the nominal strength and apparent fracture toughness can be predicted by the energy-based size effect law, which demonstrates that geomaterials have obvious quasi-brittle characteristics. Theoretical analysis indicated that the true fracture toughness and energy dissipation can be calculated by linear elastic fracture mechanics only when the brittleness number is higher than 10; otherwise, size effect tests should be adopted to determine the fracture parameters.
