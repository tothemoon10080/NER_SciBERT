Macrophages polarization in bone immune microenvironment is crucial in bone regeneration. In this work, mineralized collagen (MC) coatings with photo-thermal effect were prepared through incorporation of polydopamine (PDA). MC coatings with different thicknesses were deposited on titanium substrate through electrochemical deposition. PDA preformed on the substrate, acting as a photo-thermal agent. The effects of light illumination, i.e., different thermal effects, on the polarization of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages were explored. It was found that heat can promote the M1 polarization of macrophages and inhibit the M2 polarization. Also, gene expression results revealed that such photo illumination based macrophage modulation is effective and safe. It provides a possible way for the design of functional materials to regulate the bone immune microenvironment.
