Conventional mining practices do not extract all mineralized rocks due to prevailing economics. Improvement in mineral prices and processing recovery (technology) could potentially make mineralized waste rocks profitable. A well-integrated mining strategy that focuses on both economic and physical resource depletion is vital to the management of non-renewable mineral resources. In this paper, a conceptual framework that maximizes the benefits of mining and processing mineralized waste rocks as future resource is proposed. Governmental policy and technical reforms that ensure mining companies incorporate the proposed mineralized waste rocks management framework in their long-term strategic mine plans have been recommended.
