Microorganisms in flotation and minerals processing may significantly affect the grade and yield of metal concentrates. However, studying the phenomena requires working techniques to detach microorganisms and their DNA from mineral particles to which they strongly adhere. We developed a new method utilizing the competitive properties of anionic nanocellulose to block sorption of DNA to and detach microbial cells from mineral particles from ore processing. In general, up to one ng DNA mL−1 sample was obtained with the custom anionic nanocellulose method (CM) compared to DNA amounts below the Qubit assay's detection limit for extractions with a commercial kit (KIT). Similarly, 0.5–4 orders of magnitude more bacterial 16S and fungal 5.8S rRNA gene copies were detected by qPCR from CM treated samples compared to KIT extractions. A clear difference in the detected microbial community structure between CM and KIT extracted samples was also observed. Commercial kits optimized for mineral soils are easy to use and time efficient but may miss a considerable part of the microbial communities. A competing agent such as anionic nanocellulose may decrease the interaction between microorganisms or their DNA and minerals and provide a comprehensive view into the microbial communities in mineral processing environments.
