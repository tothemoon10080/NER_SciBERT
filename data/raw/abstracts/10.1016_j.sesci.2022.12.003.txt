Based on results of geological survey and mineral resources research over the past decades, the authors have systematically summarized the metallogenic geologic settings of Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines in Southeast Asia. Mineral geological database has been established, regional geological maps, geotectonic units with division maps, magmatic rock distribution maps and metallogenic regularities of some important metallogenic belts in Southeast Asia have been compiled. The distribution characteristics of major minerals such as copper, gold, aluminum, potassium, nickel, chromium, tungsten and tin, lead and zinc, iron, manganese and antimony, and the genetic types of these minerals are summarized. Meanwhile, twenty metallogenic belts are divided and nine main metallogenic epochs are summarized. We also analyze the influence of the tectonic evolution of the East Tethys, as well as the subduction and collision between the Indian-Australian plate, the Pacific plate, the Philippine sub-plate and the Eurasian plate on the mineralization in Southeast Asia. This study provides a number of valuable data and geological information for understanding the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of minerals, and the prospecting targets in Southeast Asia.
