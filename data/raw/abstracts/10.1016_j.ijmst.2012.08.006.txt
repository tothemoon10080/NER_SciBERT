In this paper, the effect of various electrochemical environments in the galena flotation is investigated. The electrochemical environments consisted of a ball mill for grinding of galena ore and a Denver flotation cell for flotation of galena in the laboratory scale. In order to achieve the maximum recovery with sodium hyposulfite, the concentrations of 0.06 and 0.12M of air and nitrogen gases have been used to control the pulp potential in the Denver flotation cell. The galena sample was from the “Era mine” which is located in the Kiyasar area, north of Iran. This mine contains: Galena (PbS) at least 22%, Fluorite (CaF2) 73.37%, Quartz (SiO2) 2.54% and other minerals such as Cerussite (PbCO3) and Kaolinite (Al2Si2O5(OH)4). Flotation of Galena was conducted in a 0.12M of sodium hyposulfite solution. It was found that the amount of recovery by this process was 85% and 63% in the presence and absence of potassium amyl xanthate (KAX) and at an estimated potential of 280 to 350mV respectively while the recovery was 70% and 52% at an approximate potential of 175 to 210mV in water in the presence and absence of collector (KAX).
