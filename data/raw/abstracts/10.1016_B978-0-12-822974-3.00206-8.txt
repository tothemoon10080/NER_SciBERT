The clay fraction of soils consists of mineral particles <2μm in diameter, with the most abundant component being clay minerals based on sheets of tetrahedral and octahedral structural units containing silicon (Si), aluminum (Al), and oxygen (O). These exceedingly small particles crystallize in the aqueous environment at the Earth's surface and are responsible for many of the most important physical and chemical properties of soils such as cation exchange, water holding capacity, ability to supply plant nutrients, shrink–swell properties, and the ability to attenuate pollutants.
