Oxidation of phenol, cyanide and aniline have been analyzed by the enhanced electro-oxidation process in which sodium chlorite was used as an electrolyte and results were validated using statistical tool based on Box-Behnken design. The mineralization efficiency of 78.4%, and 98.18% were predicted at optimized variables condition for phenol, and aniline respectively, whereas complete mineralization has been observed for the cyanide at the optimized conditions, which describes the significance of the design model approach.The process mineralizes the higher phenol concentration revealing a drastic reduction in power consumption in comparison of direct oxidation, i.e., 799.36 kWh/kg to 138.18 kWh/kg for more than 90% mineralization of phenol even at a higher current density of 13.63 mA/cm2. The kinetic modelling approach justified that higher current density has also played a role in higher mineralization of pollutants at the specific operating conditions. The by-product formation and toxicity effect on microalgae in wastewater were assessed by the full scan mass spectrometry and microalgae pigment inhibition test after the electro-oxidation of coking wastewater. The pigment growth inhibition rate of Chlorella sp. NCQ and Micractinium sp. NCS2 suggests that sodium chlorite as an electrolyte aid can also effectively used as an oxidizing agent and algal inhibiter in the coking wastewater.
