Substance basis of selenium (Se) enriched green tea (Se-GT) plays a crucial role in imparting numerous health benefits to the consumer, however, the complex relationship between minerals, chemical ingredients, and Se in tea leaves remains largely unknown. Here, the contents of 14 minerals and 29 bioactive components (including 19 amino acids, 8 polyphenols, and 2 alkaloids) were determined in five green tea samples with different Se levels. Marked differences were observed in the elemental and chemical profiles of the five groups of teas. Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated that Se was likely to be synergistic with Zn, while antagonistic with Mg, Al, Cr, Fe, and As. Inconspicuous correlations between amino acids and Se in tea leaves were discussed via this extended study. Moreover, Se showed positive correlations with gallic acid, (+)-catechin, and gallated catechins (like (−)-epigallocatechin gallate, (−)-gallocatechin gallate, and (−)-epicatechin gallate), but negatively correlated with some non-gallated catechins (including (−)-gallocatechin and (−)-epigallocatechin) in tea leaves. These results suggested that Se has significant effects on the accumulation of minerals and polyphenols in tea leaves. Overall, this study elucidates the elemental and chemical basis of Se-GT and provides a rationale for the quality evaluation of Se-GT, which is of crucial importance for tea industry.
