The permanent storage of carbon dioxide in form of stable carbonates is one of many options to utilize CO2. The Research Studio Austria “Carbo Resources” evaluates three different carbonation routes and also different input materials from primary and secondary origin, to find the optimal process parameters for the development of a multistage process with the aim to gain commercially valuable mineral carbonates and also marketable by-products.
                  Laboratory experiments have made it possible to balance all process steps in order to generate a mass balance study for the overall process. The results of this ongoing project are presented in this paper.
