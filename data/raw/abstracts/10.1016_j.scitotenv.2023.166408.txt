Soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization is essential to biogeochemical recycling in terrestrial ecosystem. However, the microbial mechanisms underlying the nutrient-induced SOC mineralization remain uncertain. Here, we investigated how SOC mineralization was linked to microbial assembly processes as well as soil nutrient availability and stoichiometric ratio in a paddy rice ecosystem at four soil profile levels. Our results showed a sharp decrease in SOC mineralization from topsoil (112.61–146.34 mg CO2 kg−1 day−1) to subsoil (33.51–61.41 mg CO2 kg−1 day−1). High-throughput sequencing showed that both abundance and diversity of specialist microorganisms (Chao1: 1244.30–1341.35) significantly increased along the soil profile, while the generalist microorganisms (Chao1: 427.67–616.15; Shannon: 7.46–7.97) showed the opposite trend. Correspondingly, the proportion of deterministic processes that regulate specialist (9.64–21.59 %) and generalist microorganisms (21.17–53.53 %) increased and decreased from topsoil to subsoil, respectively. Linear regression modeling and partial least squares path modeling indicated that SOC mineralization was primarily controlled by the assembly processes of specialist microorganisms, which was significantly mediated by available soil C:N:P stoichiometry. This study highlighted the importance of soil stoichiometry-mediated bacterial community assembly processes in regulating SOC mineralization. Our results have an important implication for the integration of bacterial community assembly processes into the prediction of SOC dynamics.
