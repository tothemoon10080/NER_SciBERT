Understanding of the metallurgical behaviour of indium is dependent on an accurate appraisal of the mineralogical site of the element in a given ore or concentrate. The dominant indium-bearing mineral in (Pb)–Zn ores and concentrates is sphalerite. Indium is substituted within the crystal lattice of sphalerite via the coupled substitution 2Zn2+
                     ↔Cu+
                     +In3+, typically at concentrations ranging from <1ppm up to several wt.%. Chalcopyrite may play a subordinate role as an indium-carrier, but is only important when there is little sphalerite present. Discrete indium-minerals such as roquesite (CuInS2) or laforêtite (AgInS2) are generally only minor phases, except in indium-bearing ores with extremely low Zn content. Minor amounts of indium may also be incorporated into other phases such as stannite or stannoidite, but these minerals are likely to play a negligible role in the overall mineralogical balance for indium.
