Bacterial conjugation is one of the most prominent ways for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) transmission in the environment. Interfacial interactions between natural colloidal minerals and bacteria can alter the effective contact of bacteria, thereby affecting ARGs conjugation. Understanding the impact of iron minerals, a core component of colloidal minerals, on ARGs conjugation can help assess and intervene in the risk of ARGs transmission. With three selected iron minerals perturbation experiments, it was found that the conjugative transfer of plasmid that carried kanamycin resistance gene was 1.35 − 3.91-fold promoted by low concentrations of iron minerals (i.e., 5 − 100 mg L−1), but inhibited at high concentrations (i.e., 1000 − 2000 mg L−1) as 0.10 − 0.22-fold. Conjugation occurrence was highly relevant to the number of bacteria adhering per unit mass of mineral, thus switch in the adhesion modes of mineral-bacterial determined whether the conjugate transfer of ARGs was facilitated or inhibited. In addition, a unified model was formularized upon the physicochemical and physiological effects of adhesion on conjugation, and it can be used in estimating the critical inhibitory concentration of different iron minerals on conjugation. Our findings indicate natural colloidal minerals have great potential for applications in preventing the environmental propagation of ARGs through interfacial interactions.
