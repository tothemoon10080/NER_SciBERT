Permeability is a key parameter for coalbed methane development. Although the absolute permeability of coal has been extensively studied, wettability and pore structure properties continue to challenge the microscopic description of water-gas flow in coal. For this purpose, we reconstructed the microstructures of low-rank coal using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) images. Pore geometry and pore-throat parameters are introduced to establish a relationship with absolute permeability. A dual-porosity pore network model is developed to study water-gas displacement under different wetting and pore structure properties. Results show that absolute permeability is significantly affected by pore geometry and can be described using a binary quadratic function of porosity and fractal dimension. Water-gas relative permeability varies significantly and the residual gas saturation is lower; the crossover saturation first decreased and then increased with increasing porosity under hydrophobic conditions. While the water relative permeability is lower and a certain amount of gas is trapped in complex pore-throat networks; the crossover saturation is higher under hydrophilic conditions. Models with large percolating porosity and well-developed pore networks have high displacement efficiency due to low capillary resistance and avoidance of trapping. This work provides a systematic description of absolute permeability and water-gas relative permeability in coal microstructure for enhanced gas recovery.
