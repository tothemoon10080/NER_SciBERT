The scaling-induced wetting phenomenon seriously affects the application of membrane distillation (MD) technology in hypersaline wastewater treatment. Unlike the large amount of researches on membrane scaling and membrane wetting, scaling-induced wetting is not sufficiently studied. In this work, the current research evolvement of scaling-induced wetting in MD was systematically summarized. Firstly, the theories involving scaling-induced wetting were discussed, including evaluation of scaling potential of specific solutions, classical and non-classical crystal nucleation and growth theories, observation and evolution of scaling-induced processes. Secondly, the primary pretreatment methods for alleviating scaling-induced wetting were discussed in detail, focusing on adding agents composed of coagulation, precipitation, oxidation, adsorption and scale inhibitors, filtration including granular filtration, membrane filtration and mesh filtration and application of external fields including sound, light, heat, electromagnetism, magnetism and aeration. Then, the roles of operation conditions and cleaning conditions in alleviating scaling-induced wetting were evaluated. The main operation parameters included temperature, flow rate, pressure, ultrasound, vibration and aeration, while different types of cleaning reagents, cleaning frequency and a series of assisted cleaning measures were summarized. Finally, the challenges and future needs in the application of nucleation theory to scaling-induced wetting, the speculation, monitoring and mitigation of scaling-induced wetting were proposed.
