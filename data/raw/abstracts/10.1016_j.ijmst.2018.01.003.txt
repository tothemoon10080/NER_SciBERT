Triboelectric separation, as an entirely dry technology, is a prospective method to process fine minerals. The aim of this paper is to investigate the performance of triboelectric separation of ilmenite and quartz minerals in a lab unit and to get ready for the separation of ilmenite ore. A tribocharge measurement system was used to test the triboelectric properties of ilmenite and quartz particles with tribochargers respectively made of PVC, PPR, PMMA, Teflon, copper, stainless steel and quartz glass. The results show that the ilmenite particles charged positively while quartz charged negatively when tribocharged with PVC tribocharger. The mixture of 12% ilmenite and 88% quartz was prepared for the triboelectric separation. The recovery of ilmenite increases with the increase of airflow rate, decreases with the increasing feed rate, and grows up firstly and then decreases with the increasing voltage. A maximum ilmenite recovery of 51.71% with ilmenite content 32.72% was obtained at 40 m3/h airflow rate, 6 g/s feed rate and 20 kV voltage. According to the optimal parameters of the separation of ilmenite and quartz mixture, fine ilmenite ore with 7.55% Ti content was beneficiated using the unit and the Ti content increased to12.32% in concentrate product.
