The coexistence of minerals, heavy metals and microplastics in sediment has been widely reported, while the interactions between minerals and heavy metals may be affected by the presence of microplastics. Therefore, to elucidate the effect of microplastics on the interactions between heavy metals and sediment minerals, this study conducted a series of experiments using polystyrene (PS) microplastics, Pb/Cr/Cd and ferrihydrite (Fh). The presence of PS microplastics with ferrihydrite (Fh-MPs200, mass ratio of ferrihydrite to PS of 200:1) improved the adsorption capacity of ferrihydrite, especially with an increase of 36 % for Pb. Morphological characterization demonstrated that the nano-ferrihydrite particles were dispersed on the surface of the PS microplastics, increasing the available reaction sites of the ferrihydrite particles. Furthermore, the results of zeta potential and pH effect showed that the reduction in electrostatic repulsion after adding PS was another critical reason for the increase in Pb adsorption by Fh-MP200. As a result, the presence of PS microplastics enhanced the complexation of Pb ions and the hydroxyl groups on the ferrihydrite surface. This study demonstrated that the presence of microplastics in the sedimentary environment can alter the dispersion and surface properties of minerals, thereby affecting the accumulation and transportation of heavy metals at the water-sediment interface.
