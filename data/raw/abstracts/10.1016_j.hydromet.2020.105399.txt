Solid waste tailings from acid leaching of Gattar mineralized ore material contain economic and valuable minerals were processed to obtain some economic products. Firstly, these tailings were upgraded to a high‐‑titanium concentrate, which was then roasted with newly used (NaOH/Na2CO3) flux, for which the most suitable conditions for roasting were established. Then, the roasted masses were leached with hot water to selectively dissolve vanadium, silica and alumina leaving titanium in the leach residue (Ti-slag). Vanadium was recovered from the water leachate as a pure by-product. Thereafter, the Ti-slag was subjected to H2SO4 leaching to dissolve Ti, Fe, Mn and Zr. The effects of different parameters for H2SO4 leaching on the dissolution of Ti were determined. Titanium was separated as a pure TiO2 product in a single extraction stage with purity 99.9 wt%. The crystallographic transformations that occurred through the different processes were examined using XRD.
