Earthworm-induced microbial enrichment is the key to success in vermitechnology, yet the influence of initial earthworm stocking density on microbial community profiles in vermibeds is unknown. Therefore, vermicomposting of lignocellulosic feedstock was performed with different stocking densities of two earthworms (Eisenia fetida and Eudrilus eugeniae) compared with composting. Eventually, earthworm growth, microbial (activity and community profiles), and physicochemical dynamics were assessed. The earthworm population significantly increased under low stocking, while denser stocking (15/kg) was stressful. The XRD-based crystallinity assessment revealed that comminuting efficiency of Eisenia and Eudrilus was prudent at 7 and 10 worm/kg stockings, respectively. Moreover, the 5 and 7 worm/kg stockings effectively mobilized microbial activity, promoting NPK-mineralization and C-humification balance. Correlation statistics indicated that earthworm stocking density-driven microbial community shift and fatty acid profiles strongly influenced metal removal in vermibeds. Hence, the findings implied that 5â€“7 worm/kg stockings of earthworms produced high-quality sanitized vermicompost.
