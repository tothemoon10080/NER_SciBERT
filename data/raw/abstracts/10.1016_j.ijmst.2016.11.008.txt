In order to study pillar and overburden response to retreat mining, a ground control program was conducted at a Central Appalachian Mine. The program consisted of several monitoring methods including a seismic monitoring system, borehole pressure cells in the pillars, and time-lapse photogrammetry of the pillar ribs. Two parallel geophone arrays were installed, one on each side of the panel with the sensors mounted 3m into the roof. A total of fourteen geophones recorded more than 5000 events during the panel retreat. A MIDAS datalogger was used to record pressure from borehole pressure cells (BPCs) located in two adjacent pillars that were not mined during retreat. A series of photographs were taken of the pillars that had the BPCs as the face approached so that deformation of the entire rib could be monitored using photogrammetry. Results showed that pillar stability and cave development were as expected. The BPCs showed an increase in loading when the face was 115m inby and a clear onset of the forward abutment at 30m. The photogrammetry results displayed pillar deformation corresponding to the increased loading. The microseismic monitoring results showed the overburden caving inby the face, again as expected. The significance of these results lies in two points, (1) we can quantify the safe manner in which this mine is conducting retreating operations, and (2) we can use volumetric technologies (photogrammetry and microseismic) to monitor entire volumes of the mine in addition to the traditional point-location geotechnical measurements (BPCs).
