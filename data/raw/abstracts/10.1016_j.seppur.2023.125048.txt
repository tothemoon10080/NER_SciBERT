Metal–organic framework (MOF) collectors formed by the coordination of lead ions and benzohydroxamic acid (Pb–BHA) are favorably selective for the flotation separation of calcium-containing minerals. However, the large dosage requirement and foam instability have hindered the industrial applications of MOF collectors. To enhance the collecting ability and hydrophobicity of the Pb–BHA structure, this paper introduces new ligands to form multiple ligand–MOF (ML–MOF) collectors. Through a molecular-design approach, the study analyzes the crystal and electronic structures of the target and gangue minerals, calculates the quantum chemical properties of the organic ligands, constructs the ML–MOF collectors, and determines the interaction strengths between the ML–MOF collectors and mineral surfaces to predict the flotation performances. Finally, the flotation performance of the newly developed collector is confirmed through a series of micro-flotation tests. Among the ML–MOF collectors constructed with four candidate ligands—octylhydroxamic acid (OHA), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), oleic acid, and styrene phosphonic acid—Pb–BHA–SDS and Pb–BHA–OHA excellently and selectively absorbed scheelite, wolframite, and cassiterite in flotation. In addition, they form stable froths and can be applied at low dosage. The correctness of the design results was quantified in terms of their collecting-ability index and selectivity index obtained in a flotation test. The proposed design methodology realizes ML–MOF collectors for the flotation separation of complex multi-mineral systems.
