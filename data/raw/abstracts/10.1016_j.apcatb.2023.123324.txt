This work explored the feasibility of synergizing singlet oxygen (1O2) and electron transfer pathway (ETP) during catalytic decomposition of peroxymonosulfate to advance the refractory pollutant mineralization. N doping strategy was employed to synthesize Mn-C-N catalyst with two independent catalytic sites. The results showed that the contribution of 1O2 and ETP to diclofenac removal could be well matched to 56% and 44% in Mn-C-N/PMS oxidation system, respectively. Mechanism studies revealed that 1O2 would generate intermediate products with low E

                     , which were rapidly transformed via ETP and finally resulted in improved mineralization performance. Under 0.2 g/L Mn-C-N, 50 mg/L diclofenac, 0.4 g/L peroxymonosulfate, and actual water quality conditions, about 100% removal (15 min) and 70% mineralization efficiency (1 h) was achieved. The above non-radical oxidation system was effective for treating livestock wastewater and secondary effluent. This work prospects the synergy of non-radicals for remediating refractory contaminants-laden wastewater.
