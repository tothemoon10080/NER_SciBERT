The dispersion state and the efficiency of the mixture of the different components in a composite film have an important impact on its mechanical and optical properties. In the present work, the impacts of different dispersion treatments on the disaggregation state of fibrous clay particles in water, and on the properties of related cellulose nanofiber (CNF)-based composite films, were evaluated. X-ray diffraction studies, performed on samples of sepiolite and palygorskite, revealed only minor changes in the diffraction pattern when the minerals were subjected to ultrasonic treatment, with or without the addition of different chemical dispersing agents. Conversely, microscopic studies revealed important differences in the dispersion state of the samples, induced by the addition of the different dispersants, showing an improvement in the disaggregation of the mineral crystals. The composite films prepared with sepiolite (and carboxymethylcellulose, as chemical dispersant) dispersed using ultrasonic treatment, and different types of CNF, showed improved optical and mechanical properties when compared with composites of the same counterparts prepared with sepiolite dispersed using a high-speed shear disperser.
