The efficient dewatering of fluid fine tailings (FFT) generated from warm-water extraction of Canadian oil sands is a major challenge that has limited the timely reclamation of the tailings. It is generally recognized that both chemical amendments and physical/mechanical solid-liquid separation treatments are required to speed up FFT dewatering. Significant efforts have been made to enhance the rate of solid-liquid separation of FFT in the past several decades. The fact that these efforts have met with limited successes calls for a better fundamental understanding of the solid-liquid separation process. In this work, we reviewed and critically analyzed the factors that contribute to the difficult dewatering of FFT, including the role of constituent minerals and residual bitumen. In particular, the effects of mineralogical composition, mineral particle size, and the role of residual bitumen on settling rate, hydraulic conductivity, and filtration rate are reviewed and discussed. This review also points out directions to accelerate the dewatering of FFT, such as reducing the effective volume fraction of swelling clays and releasing bitumen coating from clay surfaces, that may significantly increase the filtration rate of oil sands tailings.
