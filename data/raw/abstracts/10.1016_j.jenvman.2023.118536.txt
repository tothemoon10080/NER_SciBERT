Sequestration of soil organic carbon (SOC) is an effective means to draw atmospheric CO2. Grassland restoration is one of the fastest methods to increase soil C stocks, and particulate-associated C and mineral-associated C play critical roles in soil C stocks during restoration. Herein, we developed a conceptual mechanistic frame regarding the contributions made by mineral-associated organic matter to soil C during the restoration of temperate grasslands. Compared to 1-year grassland restoration, 30-year restoration increased mineral-associated organic C (MAOC) by 41% and particulate organic C (POC) by 47%. The SOC changed from microbial MAOC predominance to plant-derived POC predominance, as the POC was more sensitive to grassland restoration. The POC increased with plant biomass (mainly litter and root biomass), while the increase in MAOC was mainly caused by the combined effects of increasing microbial necromass and leaching of the base cations (Ca-bound C). Plant biomass accounted for 75% of the increase in POC, whereas bacterial and fungal necromass contributed to 58% of the variance in MAOC. POC and MAOC contributed to 54% and 46% of the increase in SOC, respectively. Consequently, the accumulation of the fast (POC) and slow (MAOC) pools of organic matter are important for the sequestration of SOC during grassland restoration. Overall, simultaneous tracing of POC and MAOC helps further understand the mechanisms and predict soil C dynamics combined with the input of plant C, microbial properties, and availability of soil nutrients during grassland restoration.
