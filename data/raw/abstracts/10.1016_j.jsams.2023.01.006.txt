Objectives
                  This work aimed to study the effects of Yi Jin Jing plus Elastic Band Resistance exercise on bone mineral density at all parts of the body and bone metabolism index levels in postmenopausal women.
               
                  Design
                  Randomized controlled trial.
               
                  Methods
                  Forty postmenopausal women were randomly assigned equally to the exercise or to the control group. The control group maintained their lifestyle behaviors unaltered, whereas the exercise group received  Yi Jin Jing plus Elastic Band Resistance exercise. The primary outcome was overall bone mineral density at each part, and the secondary one was bone metabolism indicator levels and bone mineral density on both sides.
               
                  Results
                  The results after six months showed increased bone mineral density at all parts of the body in the exercise group (spine, P = 0.002; thighs, lumbar, and whole body, P < 0.05) and decreased bone mineral density in the control group (trunk, pelvis, and spine, P < 0.01). In particular, the decrease and increase were greater on the non-preferred (left) side than on the right side. As for bone metabolism indexes, β-Crosslaps levels reduced (P = 0.016) and a significant increase in 1,25-(OH)2-D3 (P < 0.001) can be observed in the exercise group.
               
                  Conclusions
                  The results suggested that Yi Jin Jing plus Elastic Band Resistance exercise could delay the overall decrease of bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, especially on the non-preferred side. It also increased bone formation metabolite levels and inhibited bone resorption metabolite levels.
