In this chapter, an overview is given on a conceptual basis of different applications of hyperspectral data for mineral exploration. The narrow and contiguous spectral bands of hyperspectral sensors can detect to detect the diagnostic absorption signatures of different minerals and rocks. Many surface proxies (alteration zone, caprock of mineralization, etc.) of concealed or covered mineral deposits formed under different ore genetic processes are constituted of spectrally distinguishable minerals and these minerals are discriminable using narrowband hyperspectral data. The mapping of these anomalies is important for mineral exploration. Hyperspectral data also help in accurately mapping the lithology (i.e., host rock) of mineral deposits and the spectrometric parameters of absorption features (i.e., quantitative parameters) are useful in estimating the grade of monomineralic deposits. In this chapter, the major steps followed for hyperspectral data processing for mineral exploration are also highlighted along with the physical basis of the absorption features of different minerals. Some key areas of interest in hyperspectral data utilization in advanced problems of mineral exploration and approaches to be followed for integrating hyperspectral data with other geoscientific data for the operational utilization of mineral deposits are also discussed.
