This paper deals with the experimental investigation of creeping discharges propagating along a solid insulating surface immersed in mineral oil (MO) and palm kernel oil methyl esters (PKOME). The experimental results show that the radial density of the discharge has a lognormal signature for positive discharges. The medians of the average statistical ratios between the total and maximum branch lengths obtained in MO and PKOME are around 97%. According to the presented results, it can be conclude that PKOME is a very good candidate to substitute MO.
