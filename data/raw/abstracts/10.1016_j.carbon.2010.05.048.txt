Carbon foams with an anisotropic texture and high mechanical strength were produced using precursors obtained after thermo-oxidation treatment of commercial coalâ€“tar pitch with H2SO4 and HNO3. The investigations of the relation between the properties of the precursor and the structure of obtained foam indicate, that the composition and softening point of the pitch precursor significantly affect the foaming process, foam structure and foam mechanical strength. The composition and properties of the modified pitches allow foam formation at relatively low pressure and fast heating rate during the foaming process without a stabilization treatment. The foaming process of pitch-based carbon foams, pre-treatment of the precursors, and the properties of resultant foams are discussed in this paper.
