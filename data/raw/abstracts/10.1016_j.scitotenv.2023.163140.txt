Currently, 1,2-dichloroethane (DCA) is frequently detected in groundwater and has been listed as a potential human carcinogen by the U.S. EPA. Owing to its toxicity and recalcitrant nature, inefficient DCA mineralization has become a bottleneck of DCA bioremediation. In this study, the first engineered DCA-mineralizing strain KTU-P8DCA was constructed by functional assembly of DCA degradation pathway and enhancing pathway expression with a strong promoter P8 in the biosafety strain Pseudomonas putida KT2440. Strain KTU-P8DCA can metabolize DCA to produce CO2 and utilize DCA as the sole carbon source for cell growth by quantifying 13C stable isotope ratios in collected CO2 and in lyophilized cells. Strain KTU-P8DCA exhibited superior tolerance to high concentrations of DCA. Excellent genetic stability was also observed in continuous passage culture. Therefore, strain KTU-P8DCA has enormous potential for use in bioremediation of sites heavily contaminated with DCA. In the future, our strategy for pathway construction and optimization is expected to be developed as a standard pipeline for creating a wide variety of new contaminants-mineralizing microorganisms. The present study also highlights the power of synthetic biology in creating novel degraders for environmental remediation.
