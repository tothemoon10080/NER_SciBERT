Calponin is a widely distributed protein which is associated with the bio-mineralization process in vertebrates. Recently, a new type of calponin has been found in shellfish; the present study aimed to determine if this gene in shellfish functions in bio-mineralization, one of the most important processes in a mollusk's growth. We chose Chlamys farreri, a seashell species with great economic value, as the object of the study and obtained its full-length cDNA to study the function of calponin by gene expression analysis, shell notching experiment and RNA interference assays. Calponin in C. farreri is a basic protein that is highly conserved among mollusk species. Except for high expression in the adductor muscle and foot, which correlated with its function of regulating muscle contraction, the calponin gene was expressed more in the mantle than in other tissues. The expression of the gene was induced by shell notching and an RNA interference assay showed that inhibition of calponin expression caused the growth of irregular mineral crystals on the shell. Further analysis indicated that calponin might function by regulating the expression of other mineralization-related genes. Calponin is a mineralization-related protein in C. farreri that might influence mineral crystal growth by affecting the expressions of other proteins, such as matrix proteins and mineralization-regulating proteins.
