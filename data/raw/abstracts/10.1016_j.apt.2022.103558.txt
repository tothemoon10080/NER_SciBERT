A combined grinding and liberation model was studied to predict the liberation characteristics of iron ore comminuted by a ball mill. Comminution characteristics were obtained using the one-size-fraction method; then, the iron ore samples were crushed and separated into several narrow-size fractions by screening. The size fractions were further divided into three classes by magnetic separation, namely concentrate, middling, and tailings. Subsequently, various size classes were subjected to ball milling, and the results were analyzed in the kinetic grinding model. The mineralogical textures of the ground products were analyzed using mineral liberation analysis. The beta distribution and Andrews–Mika diagram characterized the distribution of the iron content within the size fractions. The breakage characteristics of the iron ore samples varied slightly with the iron content. However, the liberation characteristics were well-described by adjusting the four parameters of the beta distribution. The variation in grinding kinetics with composition and liberation model parameters was used in the combined liberation–comminution model to predict the evolution of the size–composition matrix as grinding proceeded. The predicted results align with the experimental results. The developed model can construct a yield–recovery graph and calculate the liberation efficiency to determine the size reduction threshold for efficient separation.
