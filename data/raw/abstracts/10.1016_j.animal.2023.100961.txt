This study evaluates the effects of two rations with a positive dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) and varying Ca content and two anionic diets on mineral homoeostasis and performance in early lactation cows. For this purpose, 48 pregnant dairy cows stratified for mature equivalent milk production, parity, body condition score (BCS), and BW were randomly assigned to four treatment groups and fed the following rations during the last 3 weeks of gestation: LC: low Ca (0.24% Ca, 1.14% K, DCAD: +86 mEq/kg DM), HC: high Ca (1.23% Ca, 1.17% K, DCAD: +95 mEq/kg DM), AS: Anionic salt (1.21% Ca, 1.21% K, DCAD: −112 mEq/kg DM, and SC: SoyChlor (1.28% Ca, 1.16% K, DCAD: −115 mEq/kg DM). After parturition, all animals were fed a common postpartum diet. Data were collected until 21 days in milk. Urinary pH was significantly decreased with the AS and SC treatment in comparison to the LC and HC groups. The highest prepartum DM intake (DMI) was found in the LC group, while DMI in AS cows was lowest. Postpartum, DMI was significantly greater in LC and SC cows than in animals fed the HC and AS rations. Prepartum serum concentrations of Ca, P, and Mg as well as postpartum serum concentrations of P and Mg did not differ, while postpartum Ca was lower in the HC group, especially 24 and 48 h after parturition. The greatest energy-corrected milk (ECM) yield was observed in cows fed the LC ration prepartum. Interestingly, milk protein production was lower in SC cows compared to LC, HC and AS. This study indicates that a ration containing a restricted Ca content fed prepartum is as suitable as a low DCAD diet to improve Ca balance without compromising DMI and performance.
