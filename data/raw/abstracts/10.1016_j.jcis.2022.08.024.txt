Hydrogel-based drug delivery holds great promise in topical tumor treatment. However, the simple construction of multifunctional therapeutic hydrogels under physiological conditions is still a huge challenge. Herein, for the first time, a multifunctional hyaluronan/MnO2 nanocomposite (HHM) hydrogel with injectable and self-healing capabilities was constructed under physiological conditions through innovative in situ mineralization-triggered Mn-hydrazide coordination crosslinking. The hydrogel formed from Mn2+ and hydrazided hyaluronan under optimized conditions exhibited a high elastic modulus >1Â kPa, injectability, self-healing function, stimuli-responsiveness and catalase-like activity. In vitro and in vivo biological experiments demonstrated that our HHM hydrogel could not only efficiently relieve hypoxia by in situ catalytic decomposition of endogenous H2O2 into O2 but also achieve synergistic photodynamic/photothermal therapy of 4T1 breast cancer in a mouse tumor model. This study presented a novel mineralization-driven metal-hydrazide coordination crosslinking approach and developed a multifunctional therapeutic platform for O2-enhanced efficient topical dual-phototherapy of breast cancer.
