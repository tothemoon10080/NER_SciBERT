Natural resources, climate change, and sustainable development are critical and simultaneously interrelated issues. This study investigates the interdependence between raw minerals material and sea level rise, considering the role of economic performance and material footprint employing wavelet locale multiple correlations from 1970 to 2019. The results provide strong evidence for cross-correlation of climate change with mineral resources, economic output, and domestic material consumption (biomass-fossil, metal, and non-metal) localized at the high frequency-time domain. However, the outcomes provide weak evidence for the association between bivariate time series at low frequency, which is a limitation in the short term. Based on the results, policymakers should implement effective environmental taxes and invest in cutting-edge technologies to optimize clean energy and mineral resources in a sustainable manner.
