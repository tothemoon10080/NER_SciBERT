This paper discusses the utilization of latent variable modeling related to occupational health and safety in the mining industry. Latent variable modeling, which is a statistical model that relates observable and latent variables, could be used to facilitate researchersâ€™ understandings of the underlying constructs or hypothetical factors and their magnitude of effect that constitute a complex system. This enhanced understanding, in turn, can help emphasize the important factors to improve mine safety. The most commonly used techniques include the exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and the structural equation model with latent variables (SEM). A critical comparison of the three techniques regarding mine safety is provided. Possible applications of latent variable modeling in mining engineering are explored. In this scope, relevant research papers were reviewed. They suggest that the application of such methods could prove useful in mine accident and safety research. Application of latent variables analysis in cognitive work analysis was proposed to improve the understanding of human-work relationships in mining operations.
