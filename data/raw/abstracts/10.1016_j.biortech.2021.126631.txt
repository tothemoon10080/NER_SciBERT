In this study, two typical minerals (diatomite and bentonite) were applied during composting, and their influences on antibiotics, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), intI1 and the bacterial communities were investigated. The relative abundance of total ARGs decreased by 53.72% and 59.54% in diatomite and bentonite addition compared with control on day 42. The minerals addition also reduced the relative abundance of intI1, as much as 41.41% and 59.81% in diatomite and bentonite treatments. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the dominant candidate hosts of the major ARGs. There was a significant correlation between total ARGs and intI1 during the composting. Structural equation models further demonstrated that intI1 and antibiotics were the predominant direct factors responsible for ARG variations, and composting properties and bacterial community composition also shifted the variation of ARG profiles by influencing intI1. Overall, these findings suggest that diatomite and bentonite could decrease the potential proliferation of ARGs in chicken manure.
