This observational study described first-milking colostrum mineral concentrations and total yields, and evaluated its associations with cow serum mineral concentrations, parity, and first postpartum milking yield in 100 multiparous Jersey cows from a single herd fed a negative dietary cation-anion difference diet prepartum. Additionally, first- and second-milking colostrum mineral concentrations and total yields were compared in a subset of 65 cows. Serum minerals (Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, Zn, Fe, Cu) were assessed before first milking. Cows were milked at 9 h and 4 min ± 3 h and 32 min and at 21 h and 11 min ± 3 h and 43 min postpartum (± standard deviation); yields were recorded and samples collected for mineral concentrations assessment (Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, Zn, Fe, Cu). Linear regression was used to evaluate the associations between first-milking colostrum mineral concentrations and total yields and cows' serum mineral concentrations, parity, first-milking colostrum yield, and calving-to-milking interval. The most abundant minerals in first-milking colostrum were (least squares mean ± standard error of the mean) Ca (55.71 ± 13.52 mmol/L; 8.75 ± 5.74 g) and P (41.91 ± 13.01 mmol/L; 5.26 ± 3.72 g), followed by Na (39.65 ± 13.23 mmol/L; 3.08 ± 1.77 g), K (36.47 ± 7.57 mmol/L; 5.79 ± 4.20 g), Mg (13.43 ± 3.09 mmol/L; 1.25 ± 0.78 g), Zn (272.12 ± 113.34 μmol/L; 71.98 ± 55.34 mg), Fe (12.51 ± 3.79 μmol/L; 2.56 ± 1.55 mg), and Cu (3.34 ± 1.22 μmol/L; 0.77 ± 0.56 mg). Higher concentrations of Ca, Mg, Na, Zn, Fe, and Cu, and total yields of Mg, Zn, Fe, and Cu were observed at first- compared with second-milking colostrum. Serum and first-milking colostrum Cu concentrations were positively associated, but no significant associations were observed between other minerals' serum and first-milking colostrum concentrations or total yields. Parity was associated with first-milking colostrum Ca, P, K, and Fe concentrations and yields; younger multiparous cows had higher concentrations and total yields of these minerals. Linear (Fe), quadratic (P, Na, and K), and cubic (Mg, Zn, and Cu) associations were observed between first-milking colostrum mineral concentrations and yield. In all cases, mineral total yields were linearly associated with first-milking colostrum yield. In conclusion, variation in first-milking colostrum mineral concentrations and total yields across cows could be partially explained by cow parity and colostrum yield. Further research including primiparous and cows under different management settings is needed to expand the knowledge and understanding of colostrum mineral concentrations and total yields in dairy cows.
