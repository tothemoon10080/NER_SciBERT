The processing parameters for making ceramic tiles in the pyrophyllite–phosphoric acid binder (P–PA) system have been optimized. The optimized raw material composition requires sintering at a lower temperature of 950°C. The X-ray powder diffraction studies on the powdered sample of optimized composition have confirmed the presence of dehydroxylate pyrophyllite, tridymite (T-AlPO4), cristyoballite (C-AlPO4) forms of aluminium phosphate and formation of silico-phosphate (SiP2O7) and alkali aluminium silicates (NaAlSiO4, KAlSi3O8). The IR studies of the sample show Al–O, Si–O·P–O and Na/K–O linkages. The thermal analysis shows the formation of dehydroxylate pyrophyllite and different forms of AlPO4. Scanning electron microphotograph reveals the chunky morphology of the dehydroxylate pyrophyllite, the rhombohedral morphology of T-AlPO4 and spherical C-AlPO4 and silico-phosphate particles.
