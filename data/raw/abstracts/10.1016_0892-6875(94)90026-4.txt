The causes of environmental impact from mineral extraction are discussed. The problems associated with contaminated land in general and some of the previous reclamation techniques are reviewed. Mineral processing techniques and novel approaches to reclamation, developed at Camborne School of Mines (CSM), are described. The theoretical properties of various industrial minerals, their ability as in situ additions, or amendments, on contaminated land are presented. Mechanisms are described to explain the beneficial effects of such materials as kieselguhr, Fuller's earth, and certain zeolites, in treating contaminated land. Field trials of these and other materials are outlined. The relationship of these field trials to detailed laboratory tests is discussed. Possible uses as “end-of-pipe” additions for cleaner technology in minerals processing are outlined.
