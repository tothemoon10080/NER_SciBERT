A sensitive oxidation technique was applied to quantitative analysis of flotation chemicals adsorbed on mineral surfaces in quartz-feldspar ore processing. Distribution of flotation chemicals on single minerals was further calculated using a mathematical method. This method combines chemical analysis, mineral analysis and process data.
                  In parallel to the process studies, laboratory experiments were conducted with a specially-designed system to examine the competitive adsorption of amine between quartz and feldspar. The experiments showed that the adsorption rate plays an important role in the distribution of amine.
