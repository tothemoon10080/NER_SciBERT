The Dabaozhuang pyrite deposit is located in the western margin of theLuzong Mesozoic volcanic basinin eastern China and has distinctmetallogenic characteristicscompared to known types of massive pyrite deposits. In addition to pyrite, ores of the deposit contain a significant amount of gypsum/anhydrite. However, the mineralization processes are poorly understood and the genesis of the deposit remains controversial. In an attempt to better understand the deposit, we conducted SHRIMP in-situ oxygen andsulphur isotope analysisfor quartz, anhydrite, and pyrite, as well as LA-ICP-MS trace element analysis for pyrite. The δ18O value of quartz in the silicified tuff indicates inheritance ofoxygen isotope characteristicsfromhost volcanic rocks. The δ18O values ofquartz grainsfrom massivepyrite oressuggest the involvement of a substantial amount of meteoric water in the ore-forming fluids.Thesulphur isotopesof the pyrite in the deposit were affected by thermodynamic and redox kinetic fractionation, making the pyrite-anhydrite S isotope thermometer unsuitable for determining the ore-forming temperature. Themineral assemblagesof fluorite and native sulphur suggest that thetransition from pyrite to anhydrite occourred at temperatures above 130 ℃, with a pH value between 2 and 5. The Dabaozhuang deposit shares similarities with VMS deposits in terms of orebody shape, ore structure, mineralization temperature, pH value, and oxygen fugacity. The main difference lies in the fertility of the magmatic-hydrothermal fluid. Further research is necessary to explore this type of deposit in the volcanic apparatus near polymetallic deposits.
