The unique luminescent performance of lanthanide complexes/clay minerals hybrid materials has been fascinating many researchers for recent decades. It not only retains the excellent luminescent characteristics of lanthanide complexes but also improves the poor stability of the complexes. In this article, we introduce the luminescence mechanism of lanthanide complexes and point out the necessity of their combination with clay minerals. After the analysis of the structure and interlayer environment differences of 1:1-type and 2:1-type clay minerals, the intercalation methods (covalent grafting and ion exchange) appropriate for different clay minerals are summarized with examples. Based on the luminescence characteristics of the hybrid materials, the applications of these materials as luminescent probes in recognition of specific metal cations and molecules, detection of pH value, and temperature are reviewed. Finally, the current problems in the preparation of lanthanide complexes/clay minerals hybrid luminescent materials and shortcomings that need improvement in their performance are analyzed, and the application prospect is forecast.
