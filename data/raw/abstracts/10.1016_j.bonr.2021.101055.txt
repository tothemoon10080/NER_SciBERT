Post-menopausal osteoporosis is characterized by a negative imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption resulting in a net bone loss, increasing the risk of fracture. One of the earliest interventions to protect against this was hormonal replacement therapy (HRT).
                  Bone strength depends on both the amount and quality of bone, the latter including compositional / material and structural properties. Bone compositional / material properties are greatly dependent on both patient-, and tissue-age.
                  Raman spectroscopy is an analytical tool ideally suited for the determination of bone compositional / material properties as a function of tissue age as it is capable of analyzing areas ~1 × 1 μm2 in tetracycline labeled bone forming areas. Using such analysis of humeri from an ovariectomized primate animal model, we reported that loss of estrogen results in alteration in the mineralization regulation mechanisms by osteoid organic matrix attributes at actively forming bone surfaces. In the present work, we used Raman microspectroscopic techniques to compare osteoid and youngest mineralized tissue composition, as well as relationships between osteoid organic matrix quality and quality attributes of the earliest mineralized tissue in paired iliac crest biopsies obtained from early postmenopausal women before and after two years of HRT therapy. Significant correlations between osteoid proteoglycans, sulfated proteoglycans, pyridinoline, and earliest mineralized tissue mineral content were observed, suggesting that in addition to changes in bone turnover rates, HRT affects the osteoid composition, mineralization regulation mechanisms, and potentially fibrillogenesis.
