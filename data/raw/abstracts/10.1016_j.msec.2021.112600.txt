Bioprinting – printing with incorporated living cells – has earned special attention on tissue engineering approaches, aiming to closer reproduce the 3D microenvironment of the target tissue. However, it raises extra complexity related to the need to use cell-friendly printing conditions that still comply with material printing fidelity. Inspired by the composite nano structural organization of mineralized tissues, this work reports the efficiency of the chemical approach followed to in situ mineralize blue shark skin collagen, at a nano scale level, to ultimately produce stable inks. The influence of initial cellular density was evaluated by assessing three different concentrations (2.5, 5 and 7.5 × 106 cells·ml−1) of human adipose stem cells (hASC), with the higher density of encapsulated cells presenting improved viability in a long culture term. Immunodetection of osteogenic-related markers, like RUNX2 and osteopontin, 21 days after cell culture in basal conditions confirmed the potential of the ink to be applied for osteogenic purposes, which may be associated with the success of the cell-to-ink interaction and the Ca2+ ions released from the co-precipitated hydroxyapatite. A combination of mineralized shark collagen, alginate and hASC is thus proposed as a bioactive bioink with potential properties for regeneration of bone tissue.
