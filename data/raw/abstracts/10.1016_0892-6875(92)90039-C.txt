This paper reviews the status of mineral processing models, and the simulator structures in which they are used. The modelling process is briefly considered in the context of model classification, data adjustment and parameter estimation. The features of a good simulator are enumerated, and recent progress in simulator development and application is discussed.
                  Models currently available are reviewed, with particular reference to those incorporated in the JKMRC Simulator, JKSimMet. and its derivatives. These include crushers, SAG mills, ball mills, screens, hydrocyclones and other classifiers. The status of flotation and mineral liberation models is considered, and recently developed models of dense medium separation and gravity concentration processes are described.
                  It is concluded that simulation for process design and optimisation is now an established technique, as evidenced by its increasing use by practising engineers through commercially available simulator software. Emphasis is placed on the importance of seeking the most effective process models as a basis for the successful use of simulation in practical applications.
                  The challenges for the future include modelling mineral liberation, flotation and other concentration processes, and the further development and application of dynamic simulators.
