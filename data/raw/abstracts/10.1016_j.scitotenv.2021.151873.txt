The widespread application of antibiotics have aroused serious pollution over the world. Microbial fuel cell (MFC) air cathode was able to simultaneously recover electricity and perform advanced oxidation of pollutions through electro-Fenton (EF). This study synthesized an iron‑cobalt oxide and graphene composite (FeCoO/GO), which possessed high electrochemical activity and ORR catalytic performance. The uniform decoration of FeCoO/GO in MFC air cathode distinctly increased the electricity generation (4.5 times higher than carbon felt) and oxytetracycline (OTC) degradation and detoxification (1.33 times higher). FeCoO/GO boosted the H2O2 generation from ORR (1.14 times higher than CF) and mineralization efficiency of OTC (2.63 times higher than CF). UPLC-QTOF-MS verified that OTC was degraded and mineralized through decarboxylation, demethylation, and carbon ring cleavage by the oxidation of ·OH. The enhanced degradation of OTC was not only benefited from the increased ORR catalytic performance, but also the excellent H2O2 catalytic activity by Fe and Co for ·OH generation. This study demonstrated an effective strategy by decorating FeCoO/GO in MFC air cathode for the synergistically enhanced ORR and OTC degradation and detoxification, giving promising guidance for the deep removal of antibiotic pollutants in the environment.
