Many valuable minerals deposits are found on the deep sea floor. Significant among these are manganese nodules and poly-metallic sulfides. While much discussion and research has taken place over the last 50years, no commercial deep-sea mining operations have yet taken place. National programs in China, Japan, Korea, and India have tested mining equipment. Nautilus Minerals, a Canadian company, is planning a sulfide mining operation in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Papua New Guinea. They have tested unique seafloor mining tools in shallow water and are in the process of raising capital. The steps of a commercial mining venture are detailed in this article. These are survey the site and resources, lease the minerals, collect or cut the minerals from the sea floor, lift them to a surface support vessel, transport the crushed minerals to shore, process them to extract the valuable metals and environmentally rehabilitate the mine site and processing waste. In time, seafloor deposits may be important sources of copper, nickel, cobalt, manganese, silver, gold, lead, zinc, platinum and the rare earth elements desperately needed for high tech industries.
