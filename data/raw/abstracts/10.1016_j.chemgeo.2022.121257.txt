The Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) is the largest known igneous province on Earth. The proposal that its origins involved off-axis plume–ridge interactions remains highly controversial. Here we present new in-situ major (EPMA), trace element (LA-ICP-MS) and Sr isotopic (LA-MC-ICP-MS) characterization of clinopyroxene and plagioclase phases present in OJP tholeiitic basalts from Sites 1183, 1186, 1185, 1187. Site 1187 and Upper Site 1185 have yielded olivine tholeiites containing olivine, Ca-rich augite, Ca-deficient pigeonite, and plagioclase, inferred to be derived from higher degrees of partial melting of dominantly peridotitic mantle and reflecting relatively low crystallization temperatures. Sites 1183 and 1186 and Lower Site 1185 yielded tholeiitic basalts consisting mainly of plagioclase and Ca-rich augite without olivine, interpreted to originate from lower degrees of partial melting of pyroxenite- and peridotite-derived melts with relatively high clinopyroxene and plagioclase crystallization temperatures. Site 1187 and Upper Site 1185 plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and equilibrium melts have much lower REE contents but slightly higher in-situ Sr isotopic ratios compared to those phases at Sites 1183 and 1186 as well as Lower Site 1185. Sites 1186 and 1187 plagioclases and clinopyroxenes display normal zoned textures which are attributed to the process of fractional crystallization and extensive magma mixing beneath the heterogeneous mantle source. In-situ Sr isotopic disequilibrium between plagioclase phenocrysts and plagioclase clusters further indicates an enriched compositional heterogeneity. Due to the strong tensile forces expected at the spreading ridge, the OJP off-axis mantle plume is inferred to be drawn towards the ridge axis, leading to shifts in mineral compositions, degrees of partial melting, and crystallization temperatures inferred for the volcanics of Sites 1183, 1186, 1185, and 1187 as a function of distance from the spreading ridge. The enriched invariability of in-situ Sr isotopic compositions is likely due to the relatively long half-life of the radiogenic elements. These mineral chemistries are consistent with off-axis ridge–plume interaction.
