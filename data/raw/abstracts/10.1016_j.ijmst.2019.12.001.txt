Historically there have been a number of different hypotheses and empirical models developed in an attempt to describe the nature of fracturing above longwall panels in underground coal mining. The motivation for such models varies, ranging from understanding the impact of mining on surface subsidence, to back-analysis of caving behaviour in the immediate roof behind the longwall face. One of the most critical motivating factors that is taking on increased importance in many coalfields, is the need for better understanding, and hence prediction of the impact of mining on overlying strata, particularly strata units acting as aquifers for different groundwater horizons. This paper reviews some of the major prediction models in the context of observed behaviour of strata displacement and fracturing above longwall panels in the southern coalfields of New South Wales, south of Sydney. The paper discusses the parameter often referred to as “height of fracturing” in terms of the critical parameters that influence it, and the relevance and appropriateness of this terminology in the context of overlying sub-surface subsidence and groundwater impact. The paper proposes an alternative terminology for this parameter that better reflects what it is and how it is used. The paper also addresses the potential role of major bedding shear planes mobilised by mining and their potential influence on overlying subsidence and groundwater interference.
