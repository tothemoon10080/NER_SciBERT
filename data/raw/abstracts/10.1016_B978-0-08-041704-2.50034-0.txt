Learning capability represents the most outstanding feature of artificial neural network (ANN). To avail of this particular property of the ANN the authors are trying to form a process controller for mineral processing of which design can be established free from human expertise. At the present stage of the development the ANN process controller comprises a standard ANN with three layers for input, hidden and output activities. In order that the ANN can shape a process controller the input layer is provided with extra cells to contain the history for several times the retention period, so that the goodness of control can be evaluated pertaining to the current process dynamics.
                  The performance of the controller is observed by a process simulator operated under two types of Gaussian noise. Thus, Gaussian pink noise is used to mimic the actual process disturbance, while the particle size monitor is assumed to pick up an observation noise which is Gaussian and white. It was proved that the ANN learns itself even though slowly only with the minimum teaching by human expertise. Although the quality of control is not so high at the present stage of development, the impact of the controller requiring less design skills will be of immense value, particularly when the neuro-computing technology with higher performance is realized in future.
