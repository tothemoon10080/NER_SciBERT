A study of the phytocomposition of Ephedra alata susbp. alenda Trab is here presented. In the essential oil, mainly predominate oxygenated terpenoids such as thymol, cumal and anethole. A chemical screening revealed a high rate of alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids and quinones. In order to optimize the extraction of these compounds, three methods and five solvents have been used, and according to this, the aqueous extract obtained by Soxhlet contained the highest value of polyphenol, whereas alkaloids were best extracted by isopropanol. Some mineral elements were quantified by ED-XRF and AAS analysis to assess a potential toxicity due to overdose in comparison with the daily-recommended doses. All extracts showed strong antioxidant activity, especially the ethanolic fraction. The haemolysis behaviour of Ephedra is considered as slightly toxic. The in vivo evaluation of the acute toxicity led to the absence of lethality. However, anomalies were observed and correlated with the compositions of the extracts.
