The integrated automation system consisting of production process management system, optimal system of production indices and process control system is established for the optimization of production indices of minerals processing. The structure and functions of this system are discussed. The optimal control strategy for production indices is proposed to transform the target of production indices into the optimal setpoints of process control system automatically. It has been applied successfully to the largest hematite minerals processing factory of China with significantly proven benefits. Industrial applications show the good performance of the suggested system and its bright future in the industry.
