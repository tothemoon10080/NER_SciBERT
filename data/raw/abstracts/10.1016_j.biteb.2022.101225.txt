A soil incubation and a greenhouse pot study was set up to determine the effects of biochar-compost mix on N transformation and availability and maize seedling performance on an alkaline and an acidic dryland soil. Urea fertilizer (F), sole application of poultry litter and woodchip biochar plus urea (PB + F & WB + F), biochar-compost mixture (1:1) plus urea derived from poultry litter (PB + C + F), woodchip (WB + C + F), and no amendment or urea application treatments were tested for N mineralization and soil properties. Results indicate that despite the unequal and high total N input, PB + C + F and WB + C + F mineralized less N of the total N input compared to urea (F), in the alkaline and acidic soil type. WB + C without F addition enhanced total N uptake comparable with F, and increased maize biomass in the alkaline soil. Addition of compost to WB (WB + C) enhanced maize P uptake and performed similarly as F.
