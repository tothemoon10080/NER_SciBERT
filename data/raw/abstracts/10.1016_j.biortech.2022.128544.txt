The production of hydroxyl radicals (OH) has been documented during composting. However, the effect of OH on composting efficiency remains unclear. Here, iron mineral supplemented thermophilic composting (imTC) is proposed and demonstrated for enhancing OH production and accelerating the maturation of composting. The results indicated that the maximum OH production of imTC was 1922.74 μmol·kg−1, which increased by 1.39 times than that of ordinary thermophilic composting (oTC). Importantly, the increase of OH could greatly enhance organic matter degradation and humic substances formation during imTC, resulting in shorting the maturity time by 25 %. Enrichment of laccase-producing bacteria resulted in higher laccase activity (31.85 U·g−1) in imTC compared with oTC (23.82 U·g−1), which may have contributed to the higher level of humification in imTC treatment. This work, for the first time, proposes a feasible strategy for improving composting efficiency through the regulation of OH production during aerobic composting.
