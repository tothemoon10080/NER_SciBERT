The types, contents, and microstructures of clay minerals play important roles in controlling the adsorption and desorption of ion-absorbed type rare earth ores and heavy metals. By selecting a typical rare earth ore profile, we conducted a leaching experiment and used XRD (X-ray diffraction) and TEM (Transmission electron microscopy) analyses to determine the clay mineral types and microstructural changes after various leaching periods. The XRD phase analyses showed that the main minerals in the simulated rare earth ore were quartz, potassium feldspar, kaolinite, and illite. TEM images showed that the mineral aggregates were broken, disintegrated, and transformed by the leaching process, and a large number of moire fringes were visible. With continuous leaching, REEs (Rare Earth Elements) were gradually re-solved and leached. The results of the leaching experiment indicate that fine-grained minerals in rare earth ores, such as potassium feldspar and clay minerals, migrated downward with the leaching solution. Leaching also promoted the alteration of potassium feldspar to clay minerals, as well as mutual alteration of clay minerals. Under acidic or neutral conditions during the early stage, potassium feldspar was altered to kaolinite or illite, whereas during the middle and late stages of leaching it was altered as follows: illite → mixed-layer illite–kaolinite → kaolinite → mixed-layer kaolinite–illite → illite. This transformation has an important effect on the release of REEs and heavy metals and provides insights into improving the leaching process and explaining heavy metal pollution in rare earth mining areas.
