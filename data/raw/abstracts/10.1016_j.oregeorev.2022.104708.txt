The Linxi fluorite district is located in the southern Great Xing’an Range and tectonically belongs to the eastern segment of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Previous studies mainly focus on the metal deposits in this region, but relatively little attention has been paid to the fluorite mineralization. The Linxi district contains more than 60 fluorite deposits while the formation age, nature of mineralized fluids, and ore-forming processes are poorly understood. This study focuses on geology, geochronology and geochemistry of the fluorite deposits in the Linxi district which share similar and relatable geological features. Fluorite veins are strictly controlled by ∼S-N-, NNE-SSW- and NE-SW-striking fault zones. Ore mineral assemblages are quite simple and mainly include fluorite, quartz and calcite. Geochronological data indicate that the main-stage fluorite vein mineralization in the Linxi district occurred approximately at 137–132 Ma. Fluid inclusions hosted in fluorite, quartz and calcite mainly homogenize at 140–220 °C, corresponding to low salinities (mainly 0.3–1.2 wt% NaCl equivalent). Ore-forming fluids are characterized by low temperatures, low salinities and low densities of the H2O–NaCl system. The carbon, hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of samples obtained from the Linxi fluorite district indicate an origin of meteoric water. Combined with trace element geochemistry, fluorite, quartz and calcite in this area share a common hydrothermal origin. The large-scale fluorite mineralization in this region may link to the Late Mesozoic metal metallogenic events in the southern Great Xing’an Range associated with the extensional tectonic setting.
