There are several polymorphs of aluminum oxide, therefore, commercial aluminum oxides with different crystalline structures were selected to perform photocatalytic tests; boehmite, gamma, and alpha alumina polymorphs were chosen to analyze its photocatalytic activity for the mineralization of phenol and 4-chlorophenol using UV light. All the materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 physisorption, UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance. Also, the type of photoinduced reactive species responsible to carry out the mineralization process, were evaluated, finding that the O2
                     
                     − radicals are determinants for the photocatalytic process. The reaction mechanism involving the sensitization of the phenolic pollutant on the surface of Al2O3 for its mineralization is proposed. Although Al2O3 is an insulator, in the present work, it is proved to be an efficient material for the mineralization of phenolic pollutants.
