Biomolecules-mediated biomimetic mineralization has been extensively investigated and applied to fabricate nano-assemblies with unique hierarchical architectures and salient properties. The confined-source ion diffusion plays a key role in the biomineralization process, but little investigative efforts have focused on it. Here, we developed a simple method to mimic the in vivo condition by a confined diffusion method, and hydroxyapatite nanoflower assemblies (HNAs) with exquisite hierarchical architectures were obtained. The HNAs were assembled from needle-like hybrid nanocrystals of hydroxyapatite and hyaluronan. The results revealed that the strong interactions between ions and hyaluronan led to the nucleation of hydroxyapatite and the following aggregation. The combination of the external diffusion field and the internal multiple interactions induced the self-assembling processes. Additionally, HNAs with colloid stability and excellent biocompatibility were proved to be a promising cargo carrier for intranuclear delivery. This work presents a novel biomimetic mineralization strategy based on confined diffusion system for fabricating delicate hydroxyapatite, which offers a new perspective for the development of biomimetic strategies.
