A Longi LGS 500 wet high intensity magnetic separator (WHIMS) was used to concentrate a fine, low grade South African hematite ore. The ore was prepared into different size fractions and was subjected to changes in pulp density, magnetic field intensity and pulsation frequency which followed a 33 full factorial matrix. The concentrate mass yield and Fe grade were selected as the dependent responses to the changes. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) shows that the variables investigated are significant to the material’s response to magnetic separation. This significance was in the order of magnetic field intensity followed by pulsation frequency and then pulp density. It was also noted that a single stage magnetic separation has a potential to upgrade a feed (−75μm and 40% Fe) to a 55% Fe grade, as the pulsation frequency increases. In addition, the model predictions and actual data were in good agreement, reporting regression coefficients within acceptable ranges.
