Continuous core samples were taken through the unsaturated zone at three sites on the outcrop of Permo-Triassic sandstone in the British West Midlands. Sample sites were chosen for lack of recent, direct anthropogenic disturbance, and for differing vegetation: heathland, birch woodland and conifer forest. Interstitial water was extracted and analyzed for 32 major and trace elements. Solid phases were analyzed for exchangeable cations and mineralogy. The rate of recharge calculated using a Cl mass balance method was three times greater below heathland than below afforested sites owing to higher evapotranspiration rates in the woodlands.
                  Carbonate minerals were absent from the unsaturated zone at each site. Soil solutions were acidic and soils at the woodland sites were more acidic (pH 4.0) than those at the heathland site (pH 4.5). Acidic interstitial water solutions were found to up to 5.0 m depth in the unsaturated zone and are partially neutralized by two aluminosilicate mineral reactions in the unsaturated zone: cation exchange and K-feldspar dissolution. The rate at which these acid neutralizing reactions act to neutralize acidity is revealed by the rate of depletion of base cations from the unsaturated zone in recharge solutions; K+ (dissolution), Ca+2 + Mg+2 (cation exchange). The total base cation depletion rate was greatest below heathland; this can be attributed mainly to the greater rate of SO4 assimilation by the woodland biome.
