The basis for reasonable mineral policy aiming the safeguarding of mineral deposits is the knowledge of their demonstrated resources or potential occurrences, and their location. Such knowledge is based on exploration results, existing or planned land use and environmental protection requirements. In Poland, since 1953, exists the standardized mode of mineral resources reporting. It is a system comparable to the JORC Code exigencies and UNFC standard. The areas of occurrence of demonstrated, as well as prospective mineral deposits, are presented on geo-environmental maps 1:50,000, that cover the entire country. They allow to visualize possible conflicts with the areas of protected environment, fertile soils, forests as well as existing housing developments. The degree of such conflict is evaluated using a ranking procedure and, later, presented on additional special maps. The valorization of deposits according to their importance on a national, regional or local scale, and accessibility for mining, allows for indicating the most valuable ones, and select these of public importance (MDoPI - Mineral Deposits of Public Importance) at national and local level.
