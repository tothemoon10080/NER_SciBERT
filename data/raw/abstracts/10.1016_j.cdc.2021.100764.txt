Nowadays, drug residues continuously infiltrate the ecosystem and contribute to water pollution. The present work focus is on removing the antidepressant Sertraline Hydrochloride (Ser-HCl) from water by applying the Electro-Fenton process. However, the viability of implementing a linkage of this process with the biological was investigated as an important task to increase purification performance while reducing energy consumption and treatment times. For this purpose, the parameters influencing the degradation and mineralization of Ser-HCl by the •OH radicals generated electrochemically were optimized by surface research methodology, following Box-Benhken matrix. Thus, the optimum parameters were determined as 0.01 mM of Ser-HCl concentration. The quasi-complete mineralization of Ser-HCl by Electro-Fenton was done after 4 h of electrolysis (99% elimination of COD). The ratio BOD5/COD augments from 0.47 to 3 after 5 h of electrolysis which demonstrates the importance of Electro-Fenton pre-treatment.
