The role of iron on the degradation of different organic compounds, differing in their structure (aliphatic versus aromatic) and iron complex formation capacity, by conventional and photo-Fenton processes was investigated. Results show that these chemical characteristics can affect the degree of treatment in terms of COD and TOC removals. While aromatics exhibited a fast and great reduction in the COD by the conventional Fenton process, aliphatic compounds, apart from acetic acid, required the presence of UV light to enhance treatment results. EDTA and oxalic acid responded very positively to UV irradiation in both COD removal and mineralization, reaching the highest values showed by aromatics; and results depended on the intensity of the UV light applied. Phenol and 4-nitrophenol responded favourably to UV irradiation in terms of mineralization and slightly in COD removal. Reductions in the COD were almost total (95.99%), while only an 80% of reduction in the TOC was achieved, for the best photo-Fenton treatment of oxalic acid, phenol and nitrophenol. 60% COD and 40% TOC removals were achieved correspondingly in the case of EDTA. Acetic acid showed almost no mineralization and low COD removal (â‰ˆ20%) when treated by a conventional Fenton process; and did not enhanced results when assisting the treatment with UV light. Photo-regeneration of ferrous ion and photo-decarboxylation of iron carboxylates are assessed in the framework of these results.
