In situ remediation applications of ammonia (NH3) gas have potential for sequestration of subsurface contamination. Ammonia gas injections initially increase the pore water pH leading to mineral dissolution followed by formation of secondary precipitates as the pH is neutralized. However, there is a lack of understanding of fundamental alteration processes due to NH3 treatment. In these batch studies, phyllosilicate minerals (illite and montmorillonite) were exposed to NH3 gas with subsequent aeration to simulate in situ remediation. Following treatments, solids were characterized using a variety of techniques, including X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption analysis for surface area, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and microscopy methods to investigate physicochemical transformations. Results indicate that, at high pH, the clays are altered as observed by differences in morphology and particle size via microscopy. However, the two clays interact differently with NH3. While montmorillonite interlayers collapsed due to intercalation, illite layers were unaffected as confirmed by FTIR analysis. Further, structural changes in silicate ([SiO4]n-) and aluminol (Al-OH) groups were identified by NMR and FTIR. This research showed that mineral alteration processes occur during and after NH3 gas treatment which may be used to remove radionuclides from the aqueous phase through sorption, co-precipitation, and coating with secondary phyllosilicate alteration products.
