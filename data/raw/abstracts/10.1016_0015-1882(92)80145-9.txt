Since 1989 Brazil has been suffering from the severest recession it has ever seen. The economy is depressed and inflation is high, and the prospects for the future are not as bright as they once were. Costs must be reduced to the minimum, in order to achieve a reasonable level of competition for products, either within the country or abroad. No large-scale investments are planned in the mining industry, and developments will mainly be made in operational optimisation, through automation or processing improvements such as adjustments to equipment, reduced losses or increased product quality. For all of these reasons hydrocyclones will play a very important role in the mineral industry. Their operation is responsible for both quality and much of the overall cost of processing; this column will focus its attention on this very important piece of equipment.
