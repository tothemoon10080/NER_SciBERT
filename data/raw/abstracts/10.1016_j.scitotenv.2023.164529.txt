The excellent photochemical properties of dissolved black carbon (DBC) have been proven to be a significant contributor to the removal of organic pollutants in environment. However, the photochemical properties of DBC will inevitably be changed during biotic and abiotic processes. Herein, the structures and compositions of DBC during bio-transformation and goethite adsorption processes were comprehensively studied, and their corresponding photochemical properties were also evaluated. Bio-transformed DBC (B-DBC) contained more aromatic, high molecular weight, and phenolic substances compared with pristine DBC (P-DBC). The photodegradation of 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2) was significantly promoted by B-DBC because of its superior capacity for producing 3DBC*. Moreover, the subsequent goethite fractionation selectively reduced the parts of components with high aromaticity and carboxylic functional groups in B-DBC. The interaction between B-DBC and goethite resulted in the release of Fe2+ into goethite-fractionated DBC (G-DBC), which induced the photodegradation mechanism of EE2 shifting from a single-electron transfer driven by 3DBC⁎ to the oxidation of •OH. This study provides valuable insights into the changes in photochemical behavior of DBC resulting from biotic or abiotic processes, and enhances our understanding of the role of DBC in the fate of organic pollutants.
