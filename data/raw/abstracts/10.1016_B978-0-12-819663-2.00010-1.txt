The capture methods described in Chapters 7â€“9 aim to produce a pure or near-pure CO2 stream that can then be stored using one or other of the approaches described in Part IV. Storing CO2 in its molecular unmineralized form has numerous disadvantages, for example, the need for continued monitoring to confirm storage integrity and the potential adverse environmental impacts in the case of ocean storage or leakage from geological storage sites. In contrast, the mineralization methods discussed in this chapter seek to store carbon in the form of solid, chemically stable, and relatively benign carbonates, with the potential added advantage of providing useful mineral and mineral-based products.
