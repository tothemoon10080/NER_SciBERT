With continuous expansion of the heat produced from biomass energy, the problems of biomass ash melting and slagging have become increasingly prominent. Studies of mineral transformations and melting behaviour in biomass ash are helpful for understanding the slagging process fully. In this paper, ash samples prepared from corn straw, sawdust and rice husk were studied with an ash melting point analyser, simultaneous thermal analyser, XRD and SEM‒EDS. The results showed that the deformation temperature (DT) of corn straw was the lowest, while that of rice husk was the highest. The variations in ash weight loss and temperatures indicated that the two main paths for ash loss were decomposition and volatilization. With increasing combustion temperature, eutectic salts with low melting points were formed in the ash, such as potassium silicate and calcium silicate, and the liquid phase and crystalline phase coexisted at 1000 °C. In this paper, the influence of different elements on the ash structure and the changes occurring in ash structure during combustion and ash melting point tests are explained by considering the silicate network structure. The ash melting behaviour observed during biomass combustion is clarified, which provides a theoretical basis for preventing biomass ash from melting and slagging.
