Seeds of double low oilseed rape variety Mango (Brassica napus, var. oleifera) were subjected to a 7-day germination at 25 Â°C and 95% moisture content in darkness in a conditioning cabinet. The effects of the germination process on the superoxide dismutase-like activity (SOD-like activity), thiamine (vitamin B
                     1) and riboflavin (vitamin B
                     2) and minerals, such as Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe and Mn, were studied. Correlations between individual mineral contents, vitamin B
                     1 and B
                     2 contents, and the ability of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) extracts from germinated rapeseed to scavenge superoxide anion radicals in vitro were also investigated. SOD-like activity showed a gradual increase after the second day of germination, reaching a maximum level on the sixth day, and remained almost constant up to the end of the germination period. During germination, thiamine underwent a progressive decrease up to the sixth day, reaching a constant level between the sixth and the seventh day. In contrast, riboflavin content increased throughout the germination period up to the fifth day, and after that a constant level was observed. Levels of Ca and Mg were almost constant up to the fourth day and after that an increase of these minerals was observed. Cu and Mn increased during the germination process, and retentions of 33% and 22%, respectively, were observed at the end of germination. Fe content dropped after 1 day of germination and from there onward it started to increase gradually and an 18% retention was observed in 7-day germinated seeds. Positive correlations between SOD-like activity and riboflavin (r
                     =0.87), Cu (r
                     =0.74) and Mn (r
                     =0.87) were found during rapeseed germination.
