This paper presents an efficient COD reduction from sulfide minerals processing wastewater using Fenton process, and the COD of the tailings dam wastewater is largely reduced from 130 mg/L to 30 mg/L, so as to meet the emission limit (COD < 60 mg/L). The effects of multiple parameters influencing the Fenton process on COD of the concentrates wastewater, such as reaction time, reaction pH, and H2O2/Fe2+ molar ratio were evaluated in detail. The mechanism of COD reduction was investigated by equilibrium speciation modelling and total organic carbon (TOC) analysis. TOC analysis shows that it is difficult for the Fenton process to oxidize all of the organics in wastewater to CO2. Pilot-scale tests were further carried out to confirm the results of the laboratory tests.
