A closed-loop, Ni extraction and mineral carbonation process is being developed for producing Ni from laterite ores, where the only inputs are heat that can come from regenerable resources, and the ore. This closed-loop relies on efficient regeneration of acid and base, which are required for leaching and neutralisation respectively. This contribution investigates the leaching efficacy of regenerated acid, and proposes a novel combined leaching and acid regeneration (CLR) process where the ore is present during the acid regeneration. It is hypothesised that this will favour the recovery of acid and base, and improve leaching kinetics.
                  Results showed that the CLR process effectively shifted the equilibria to favour the production of acid. The feed solution of triethylammonium sulphate was formed by mixing 120 mmol H+ in the form of sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and 140 mmol triethylamine (Et3N). After 30 h 38 mmol of protons were regenerated in the CLR process compared to 30 mmol of protons being produced in the same timeframe during acid regeneration alone. The CLR was approximately twice as selective towards Mg and Ni over Al and Fe than leaching with the regenerated acid. However, the CLR process was not effective at increasing the recovery of base, with 60 mmol of Et3N recovered in both cases. The results show that the CLR process has the potential to reduce the acid requirements for leaching nickel laterites, which could improve the sustainability of metallurgical operations.
