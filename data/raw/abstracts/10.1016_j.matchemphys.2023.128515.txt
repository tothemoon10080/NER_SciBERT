The purpose of this work is to investigate, through numerical simulation, the influence of temperature and chemical composition on the heat capacity, density, and thermal conductivity of a novel eco-friendly glass from mineral coal bottom ash. The modeling used to represent the system is based on the heat transfer in solids with phase-change. The numerical resolution was performed by the finite element method, and the variation of physical properties with temperature and composition was represented by theoretical and empirical equations introduced in the model. After the model is experimentally validated, the behavior of these properties during cooling process was investigated, pointing out higher ash content levels resulted in higher values of heat capacity, and lower values for density and thermal conductivity. Thus, this study brings contributions in the investigation of physical properties of a novel glass obtained by reuse of mineral coal bottom ash from a thermoelectric plant.
