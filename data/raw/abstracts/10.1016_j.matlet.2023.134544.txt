The content of Sr in nacre is stable and second only to Mg, but its ability to induce aragonite is rarely reported. Therefore, the paper studied the effects of Sr2+ concentration, reaction rate and temperature on the biological mineralization of calcium carbonate in presence of egg-white proteins. The results show that Sr2+ could induce the formation of aragonite when coexisting with egg-white proteins as Mg2+. However, the large ion radius of Sr2+ makes it difficult to enter the calcite lattice, so its induction efficiency is much lower than Mg2+. Reducing the mineralization rate and increasing the mineralization temperature are beneficial to the formation of aragonite.
