Considering that the structural differences could dictate the photocatalytic efficiency, the cubic SrTiO3 (STO) and tetragonal CaTiO3 (CTO) were developed to illustrate the structureâ€“activity relationship. The STO with cubic structure demonstrates much higher photocatalytic toluene removal efficiency (ca. 80.0%) than that of CTO (ca. 20.0%), which can be ascribed to boosted formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased selectivity of intermediates, and promoted ring-opening and mineralization rate. Combining theoretical simulation and experimental characterization, the results reveal that the O2 and H2O molecules tend to be adsorbed on the cubic STO, which boosts the formation of ROS. Also, highly selective formation of intermediate (benzoic acid) has been realized to accelerate ring-open and mineralization process as evidenced by the smooth conversion of STO as indicated by Gibbs free energy. This work provides new perspectives on the understanding of relationship between intrinsic structure and photocatalytic performance.
