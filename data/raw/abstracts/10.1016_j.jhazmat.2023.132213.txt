Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) can immobilize heavy metals in soils through biomineralization, and the parent rock and minerals in the soil are critical to the immobilization efficiency of SRB. To date, there is little knowledge about the fate of Cd associated with the parent rocks and minerals of soil during Cd immobilized by SRB. In this study, we created a model system using clay-size fraction of soil and SRB to explore the role of SRB in immobilizing Cd in soils from stratigraphic successions with high geochemical background. In the system, clay-size fractions (particle size < 2 µm) with concentration of Cd (0.24–2.84 mg/kg) were extracted from soils for bacteria inoculation. After SRB reaction for 10 days, the Cd fraction tended to transform into iron-manganese bound. Further, two clay-size fractions, i.e., the non-crystalline iron oxide (Fe-OX) and the crystalline iron oxide (Fe-CBD), were separated by extraction. The reaction of SRB with them verified the transformation of primary iron-bearing minerals into secondary iron-bearing minerals, which contributed to Cd redistribution. This study shows that SRB could exploit the composition and structure of minerals to induce mineral recrystallization, thereby aggravating Cd redistribution and immobilization in clay-size fractions from stratigraphic successions with high geochemical background.
