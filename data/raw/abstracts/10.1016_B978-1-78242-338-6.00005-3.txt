In this chapter, we describe the function and structure of bone as well as the interaction between its main constituents with a specific focus on the mechanisms of bone mineralization. From a clinical perspective, we summarize the most common bone diseases caused by bone mineralization disorders. Finally, we review the main bio-inspired strategies to mineralize synthetic bone-substituting biomaterials. However, the precise mechanism of bone mineralization requires interdisciplinary knowledge, deeper understanding of bone biology, and extensive research in the future.
