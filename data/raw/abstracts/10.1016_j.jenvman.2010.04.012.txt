The aim of this work was to study the mineralization of wastewater effluent from an integrated-gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) power station sited in Spain to meet the requirements of future environmental legislation. This study was done in a pilot plant using a homogeneous photo-Fenton oxidation process with continuous addition of H2O2 and air to the system.
                  The mineralization process was found to follow pseudo-first-order kinetics. Experimental kinetic constants were fitted using neural networks (NNs). The NNs model reproduced the experimental data to within a 90% confidence level and allowed the simulation of the process for any values of the parameters within the experimental range studied. At the optimum conditions (H2O2 flow rate=120mL/h, [Fe(II)]=7.6mg/L, pH=3.75 and air flow rate=1m3/h), a 90% mineralization was achieved in 150min.
                  Determination of the hydrogen peroxide consumed and remaining in the water revealed that 1.2mol of H2O2 was consumed per each mol of total organic carbon removed from solution. This result confirmed that an excess of dissolved H2O2 was needed to achieve high mineralization rates, so continuous addition of peroxide is recommended for industrial application of this process.
                  Air flow slightly improved the mineralization rate due to the formation of peroxo-organic radicals which enhanced the oxidation process.
