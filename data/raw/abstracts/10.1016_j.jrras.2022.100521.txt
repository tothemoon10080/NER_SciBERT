Mechanically recovered poultry meat (MRPM) has widely been used as an economical raw material to replace the more expensive beef in meat products, especially emulsion type products. Therefore, this paper aimed to explore the impact of MRPM on chemical composition (moisture, protein, fat and ash) and minerals content (Ca, Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn and Mg) of luncheon produced with different percentage of MRPM (0, 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90%). The results revealed that the addition of MRPM to luncheon formulation significantly (p < 0.05) altered proximate composition and minerals content with variable degree,as higher concentration of MRPM increased fat, ash, Calcium, Iron, Copper and Manganese content and decreased moisture, protein, Zinc and Magnesium content.
