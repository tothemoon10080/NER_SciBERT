Oral exposure to mineral oil may result in a narrow fraction of mineral oil saturated hydrocarbon (MOSH) being retained in tissues. Excess of MOSH hepatic retention may lead to the formation of lipogranuloma caused by predominantly multiring cycloalkanes (naphthenics) in a critical range of C25–C35. Although hepatic lipogranuloma is of low pathological concern, MOSH tissue deposition could be minimized by using an oil of similar quality but devoid of naphthenic structures to decrease hepatic retention.
                  Synthetic Gas to liquid (GTL) oils offer an alternative to petroleum derived mineral oils, because they do not contain naphthenic structures. To demonstrate this point, SD rats were fed either GTL oil (99% iso-alkanes) or naphthenic mineral oil (84% cycloalkanes) at 200 mg/kg bw/day for 90 or 134 days with a recovery group. Liver, fat and mesenteric lymph nodes were analyzed for alkane sub-type levels using Online-HPLC-GC-FID and GCxGC-TOF-MS.
                  Results indicate that at equal external dose, GTL hydrocarbons result in lower tissue levels and more rapid excretion than MOSH. GTL retained hepatic fractions were also qualitatively different than MOSH constituents. Because chemical composition differences, GTL oil show low absorption and tissue retention potential and thus an advantageous alternative to conventional mineral oil.
