This study revealed activation mechanisms of apatite by polyacrylamide (PAM) during flotation of rare earth minerals in Bayan Obo Ore. This activation leads to high phosphorus content in rare earth concentrate. Ultraviolet (UV) absorption measurements show that adsorption of PAM on the surfaces of apatite and rare earths follows a pseudo-second-order reaction kinetic model. The isothermal adsorption process follows the Freundlich adsorption model, indicating that the adsorption of PAM on apatite is a multi-layer, non-uniform process, that is, physical and chemical adsorption occurs simultaneously. The measured zeta potential shows that under weakly alkaline conditions, amide groups with a negative charge are adsorbed on the surface of apatite, increasing the electronegativity, so that the potential is shifted negatively; however, the negative shift of the potential on the surface of rare earths is insignificant. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) test and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results imply that PAM is chemically adsorbed on the surface of apatite, while 506E undergoes stronger chemical adsorption than PAM on the surface of rare earth minerals. It is found that multi-layer, non-uniform adsorption of PAM combining physical and chemical adsorption occurs on the surface of apatite and the process is dominated by physical adsorption: the adsorption of PAM on surfaces of apatite is stronger than that on the surface of rare earth minerals. Such adsorption activates the apatite, causing it to float during the flotation of rare earths, which is the reason for the high phosphorus content in the rare earth concentrate.
