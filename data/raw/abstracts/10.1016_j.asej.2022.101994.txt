In this paper, the Frequency domain dielectric response of oil-paper insulation, employing SiO2
                     -based nanofluids is reported. It is a well-known fact that the dissipation factor (tanδ) profile is affected by the magnitude of excitation voltage & measurement temperature. Analysis of data obtained from laboratory samples suggests that the influence of excitation voltage is non-linear in nature. It is further observed that the degree of non-linearity is different for new and aged mineral oil. The frequency domain dielectric response for new mineral oil-based silica nanofluid has been found non-linearity nature at 50 Hz for sinusoidal excitation level 26 V-130 V for temperature range 50⁰C-70⁰C. Similarly, in the case of aged mineral oil, a non-linearity nature has been found at 1 Hz. The related analysis presented in this paper suggests that it is possible to express the non-linearity introduced in the value of dissipation factor (tanδ) at power frequency by a mathematical expression.
