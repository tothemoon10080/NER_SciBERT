Municipal and residential water purification rely heavily on activated carbon (AC), but regeneration of AC is costly and cannot be performed at the point-of-use. Clay minerals (CMs) comprise a class of naturally abundant materials with known capacities for analyte adsorbance. However, the gel-forming properties of CMs in aqueous suspension pose problems for these materials being used in water-purification. In this study, we have taken three main steps to optimize the use of CMs in these applications. First, we produced several variants of montmorillonite CMs to evaluate the effect of interstitial cation hydrophobicity on the ability of the CM to uptake charge-carrying organic pollutants. These variants include CMs with the following cations: sodium, hexyl(triphenyl)phosphonium, hexyadecyl(triphenyl)phosphonium, and hexyl(tributyl)phosphonium. Second, we synthesized polymer–clay mineral composite films composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), crosslinked in the presence of a CM variant. These films were evaluated for their ability to uptake malachite green (MG). Finally, we developed a one-pot synthetic method for the generation of polymer–clay particles for use in a continuous column process. We synthesized polymer–clay mineral particles using the highest performing CM (based on the film experiments) and evaluated the equilibrium capacity and kinetics of MG uptake from solution.
