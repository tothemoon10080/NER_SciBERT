In the present study, different advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are compared for their feasibility for mineralization of alkyd resin wastewater. The AOPs studied include: Fenton process, combined ozonation (O3) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), electro-oxidation (EO), wet air oxidation and cavitation using ultrasonic horn (US). The studied AOPs in the order of increasing electrical energy consumption per unit mass of TOC removal (EEM) are: Fenton process (18kWh/kg), EO (83.58kWh/kg), combined EO and O3 (187kWh/kg), wet air oxidation (429kWh/kg), combined O3 and H2O2 at pH 8 (477kWh/kg), combined US, O3 and H2O2 at pH 8 (776kWh/kg) and US alone at pH 8 (990kWh/kg).
                  Among the studied AOPs and their combinations, the combined O3 and H2O2 is most promising as it doesnâ€™t suffer from complex formation issues as in the Fenton process, EO and combined EO and O3, requires lower fixed cost as compared to wet air oxidation and requires less EEM as compared to combined US, O3 and H2O2 and US alone.
