Although the autopsies of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes from full-scale, brackish water desalination plants identify the co-presence of silica and Ca-based minerals in scaling layers, minimal research exists on their formation process and mechanisms. Therefore, combined scaling by silica and either gypsum (non-alkaline) or amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP, alkaline) was investigated in this study for their distinctive impacts on membrane performance. The obtained results demonstrate that the coexistence of silica and Ca-based mineral salts in feedwaters significantly reduced water flux decline as compared to single type of Ca-based mineral salts. This antagonistic effect was primarily attributed to the silica-mediated alleviation of Ca-based mineral scaling. In the presence of silica, silica skins were immediately established around Ca-based mineral precipitates once they emerged. Sheathing by the siliceous skins hindered the aggregation and thus the morphological evolution of Ca-based mineral species. Unlike sulfate precipitates, ACP precipitates can induce the formation of dense and thick silica skins via an additional condensation reaction. Such a phenomenon rationalized the notion concerning a stronger mitigating effect of silica on ACP scaling than gypsum scaling. Meanwhile, coating by silica skins altered the surface chemistries of Ca-based mineral precipitates, which should be fully considered in regulating membrane surface properties for combined scaling control. Our findings advance the mechanistic understanding on combined mineral scaling of RO membranes, and may guide the appropriate design of membrane surface properties for scaling-resistant membrane tailored to brackish water desalination.
