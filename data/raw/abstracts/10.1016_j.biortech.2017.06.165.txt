Considering the high concentration of mercury in industrial wastewater, such as coal-fired power plants and gold mining wastewater, this research study investigated the coupling process of lipid production and mercury bioremediation using microalgae cells. Chlorella vulgaris modified by biomimetic mineralization. The cultivation was divided in two stages: a natural cultivation for 7days and 5days of Hg2+ addition (10–100μg/L) for cultivation at different pH values (4–7) after inoculation. Next, the harvested cells were eluted, and lipid was extracted. The fluorescein diacetate (FDA) dye tests demonstrated that the mineralized layer enhanced the biological activity of microalgae cells in Hg2+ contaminated media. Hg distribution tests showed that the Hg removal capacity of modified cells was increased from 62.85% to 94.74%, and 88.72% of eluted Hg2+ concentration was observed in modified cells compared to 48.42% of raw cells, implying that more mercury was transferred from lipid and residuals into elutable forms.
