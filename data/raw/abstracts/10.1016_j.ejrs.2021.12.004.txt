Band rationing, principal component analysis (PCA) and decorrelation stretch (DS) techniques of Landsat-8 with Sentinel-2 data successfully used in the discrimination of the lithological units and the surface structure features of Wadi Al-Miyah area in the Central Eastern Desert of Egypt. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) were processed to identify the hydrothermal mineralized alteration zones related to the radioactive minerals. Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry (AGRS) has been used to determine the naturally occurring radioactive anomalous zones such as potassium (K), equivalent uranium (eU) and equivalent thorium (eTh) and to follow their spatial distribution in Wadi Al-Miyah area. The analysis of AGRS data revealed that, the study area owns a wide range of radioelement concentrations ranging from 15.5 to 98.4 μR/h, 5.9–37.1 ppm, 17.2–95.4 ppm, and 0.53%-10.29% of total count (TC), (eU), (eTh), and (K), respectively. The interpretation of the Radioelements Composite Image (RCI) successfully delineated the enrichment zones with radioelement concentrations within the alkali feldspar granite, biotite-muscovite schist, granodiorite and the hydrothermal alteration areas within the diorite of Gabal Al- Bakriyah. The results concluded that the integrated remote sensing and airborne AGRS data are promising in detecting the potential areas enriched with K, eU and eTh.
