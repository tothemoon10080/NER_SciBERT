We present a novel approach involving the in-situ growth of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) over clay minerals for the rapid and efficient removal of dyes from wastewater. The effect of mono‐metal (Cr) and bi‐metal (Co-Ni) MOFs with different morphologies of cubic- and plate-like structures, respectively, are studied on the adsorption capacity of developed MOF/clay composites. The resulting composite showed a stable structure with superb adsorption capacity toward various organic dyes, surpassing the state-of-the-art clay-based adsorbents.
