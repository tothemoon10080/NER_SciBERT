The development of hardpan caps has great potential in rehabilitating sulfidic and metallic tailings, which may be accelerated by using exogenous Acidithiobacillus species. The present study aims to establish a bioaugmentation process with exogenous Acidithiobacillus species for accelerating the weathering of sulfidic minerals and formation of secondary mineral gels as precursors for hardpan structure development in a microcosm experiment. Exogenous Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans (ATCC 19377) and A. ferrooxidans (DSM 14882) were inoculated in a sulfidic Pb-Zn tailing containing negligible indigenous Acidithiobacillus species for accelerating the weathering of pyrite and metal sulfides. Microspectroscopic analysis revealed that the weathering of pyrite and biotite-like minerals was rapidly accelerated by exogenous Acidithiobacillus species, leading to the formation of secondary jarosite-like mineral gels and cemented profile in the tailings. Meanwhile, approximately 28% Zn liberated from Zn-rich minerals undergoing weathering was observed to be re-immobilized by Fe-rich secondary minerals such as jarosite-like mineral. Moreover, Pb-bearing minerals mostly remained undissolved, but approximately 30% Pb was immobilized by secondary Fe-rich minerals. The present findings revealed the critical role of exogenous Acidithiobacillus species in accelerating the precursory process of mineral weathering and secondary mineral formation for hardpan structure development in sulfidic Pb-Zn tailings.
