Given the ever-rising demand for raw earth materials, mineral reserves are being increasingly depleted, and there is a need to pinpoint the location of additional mineral resources. However, with the absence of grassroots exploration opportunities, one should employ a suite of tools for discovering covered, buried, or blind deposits. This book endeavors to delve into the recent advances in spatial toolboxes employed for mineral exploration. These techniques are remote sensing, geochemical, geophysical, machine-learning, and deep-learning tools, all processed in geographic information systems. This chapter covers the basic ideas applied to mineral exploration, including several stages leading to discovering an ore deposit. These include, but are not limited to, the reconnaissance stage, regional exploration, and local-scale surveys. This chapter will then introduce the spatial toolbox applied to mineral exploration surveys in the stages mentioned previously. Then, different aspects covered in the upcoming chapters will be comprehensively explained.
