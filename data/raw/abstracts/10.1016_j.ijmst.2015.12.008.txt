Aiming at evaluating the stability of a rock mass near a fault, a microseismic (MS) monitoring system was established in Hongtoushan copper mine. The distribution of displacement and log(EI), the relationship between MS activity and the exploitation process, and the stability of the rock mass controlled by a fault were studied. The results obtained from microseismic data showed that MS events were mainly concentrated at the footwall of the fault. When the distance to the fault exceeded 20m, the rock mass reached a relatively stable state. MS activity is closely related to the mining process. Under the strong disturbance from blasting, the initiation and propagation of cracks is much faster. MS activity belongs in the category of aftershocks after large scale excavation. The displacement and log(EI) obtained from MS events can reflect the difference in physical and mechanical behavior of different areas within the rock mass, which is useful in judging the integrity and degradation of the rock mass.
