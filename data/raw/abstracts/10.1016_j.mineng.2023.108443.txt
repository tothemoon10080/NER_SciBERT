In the present study flocculation flotation (floc-flotation) of ultrafine hematite and quartz was investigated in a laboratory-scale flotation column. A direct flotation scheme was used to float hematite using in-house synthesized n-octyl hydroxamic acid (OHA) as a collector. A polymer system containing tannic acid (TAN) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) was used to flocculate quartz to reduce its entrainment. The effects of agitation intensity and foam stability on floc size distribution, entrainment reduction, and flotation kinetics/recovery were investigated. It was shown that the dual polymers TAN-PEO were effective in reducing quartz entrainment, and that the degree of entrainment reduction was affected by the intensity of agitation. A correlation was established between the mean floc size and a reduction in quartz entrainment. TAN-PEO dual polymer system also enhanced the flotation kinetics and recovery of hematite by OHA, originating from a synergistic effect between PEO and OHA. Therefore, higher separation efficiency was achieved from synthetic ultrafine hematite and quartz mixtures when TAN-PEO was added after OHA. The underlying mechanisms were studied by floc size distribution, surface tension, and foam height and decay time measurement. This work helps understand the relationship between hydrodynamic condition, flocs size, and mechanical entrainment when polymeric flocculation is used for entrainment reduction in fine and ultrafine minerals flotation.
