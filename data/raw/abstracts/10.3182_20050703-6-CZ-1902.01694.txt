The requirements set on the performance of industrial equipment during their life-time are increasing due to the growing demand to minimize expenses and maximize production as a result of tightening global competition. The demand to optimize the equipment performance is making the ability to utilize different services during the equipment more important. Equipment performance optimization includes integration of the process and maintenance information. In this paper the life-cycle management concepts are reviewed and a general framework and a case study in the mineral processing field is presented and discussed.
