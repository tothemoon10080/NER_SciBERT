This research evaluates the mineral resources trade pattern between China and ten ASEAN members using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag technique and annual data from 2000 to 2021. The findings confirmed that the sustainable development index harms the trade of mineral resources between China and ASEAN countries. Regarding the export of mineral resources from China to ASEAN countries, the openness of the financial markets has no significant effect. Besides, the poverty variable significantly impacts only in the short term. However, regarding China's import of mineral resources from ASEAN countries, the indicators of poverty and the openness of China's financial markets are effective in the short- and long-term. The suggested practical policies by this research are developing poverty alleviation policies, expanding regional financial markets, and multilateral trade agreements in technology transfer and green utilities.
