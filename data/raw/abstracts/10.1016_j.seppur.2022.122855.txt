Mineral carbonation is an important technology for CO2 sequestration and utilization to address environmental issues arising from climate change. In recent years, seawater has been considered a promising candidate that has relatively alkaline properties, higher Ca2+ and Mg2+ content as well as lower cost than distilled water and chemical solvents. This review assesses the concept and mechanism of mineral carbonation using seawater. Several state-of-the-art technologies are pointed out. Natural seawater, desalination brine, and seawater-based wastewater are all assessed. Herein, the emerging research is highlighted, possible research trends are suggested, and constructive perspectives are discussed to allow the impact and development of mineral carbonation technology using seawater to be appropriately assessed.
