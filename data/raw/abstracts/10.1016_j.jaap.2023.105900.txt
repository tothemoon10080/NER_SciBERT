Organic matter in sediments is dominated by kerogen, a high molecular weight geomacromolecule. Kerogen can be subdivided into Types I to IV that provide paleoenvironmental and petroleum potential information. Kerogen typing can be performed by several chemical methods including elemental analysis (H/C and O/C), FTIR and pyrolysis-gas chromatography techniques. However, kerogens occur naturally within mineral matrices and these can influence the chemical responses. We have examined the effects of a range of minerals (namely kaolinite, lizardite, ripidolite, illite, montmorillonite, haematite, goethite, limonite and magnetite) on the responses of kerogen to pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We used aliphatic hydrocarbon containing kerogen Types I and II from Carboniferous Midland Valley shales of Scotland and the Jurassic Oxford Clay of southern England, respectively, as well as a pure synthetic aliphatic polymer, polyethylene. We find that the aliphatic organic matter in Type I kerogens is transformed by interaction with minerals during pyrolysis to give a signal incorrectly suggesting more contributions from land plant-containing kerogens, such as a large number of aromatic molecules. Pyrolysis with goethite, limonite and magnetite leads to almost complete destruction of the organic matter. Hence, the mineral composition of sedimentary rocks during pyrolysis should be considered when assigning kerogen types. Failure to consider the effects of minerals can lead to incorrect assignment of kerogen type and, therefore, erroneous interpretations of paleoenvironments and petroleum potential.
