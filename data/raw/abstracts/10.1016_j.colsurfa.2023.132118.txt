Previous studies have shown that the dissolution alters the static intrinsic properties of mineral surfaces, such as changing the surface components or active sites, which in turn affects the floatability. In this work, the dissolution process of smithsonite with different particle sizes and its influence on the flotation behaviour were systematically investigated from a dynamic perspective of the dissolution of ions on the mineral surface. Micro-flotation experiments revealed the inhibition of the flotation of smithsonite during the early phases of dissolution, particularly in the case of the fine particle. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) tests, Inorganic carbon (IC) tests, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicated that the early phases of the dissolution process of smithsonite exhibited a more rapid rate of zinc ions. However, as the dissolution progressed and a state of saturation was reached, the further dissolution of carbonate inhibited that of zinc ions. Subsequent adsorption measurements and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis illuminated the transformation in flotation behaviour resulting from the surface dissolution of smithsonite, primarily by affecting the stability of the adsorption of agents. The rapid dissolution rate of ions on the surface of smithsonite led to decreased adsorption stability of (sodium oleate) NaOL and diminished floatability. This phenomenon was particularly discernible on the surface of fine particle smithsonite. This investigation advances a novel mechanism for comprehending the impact of the surface dissolution processes on the flotation behaviour of smithsonite of different particle sizes, providing a theoretical and practical reference for the flotation of fine particles and marginally soluble minerals.
