This study presents the mineral magnetic, particle size, and organic content data of surface soils from Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica. The analysis of isothermal remanent magnetization and the high specific magnetic susceptibility values –mean (±S.D.) values of 117.7 (±175.0) × 10−8m3kg−1 for Broknes Peninsula and of 330.9 (±217.4) × 10−8m3kg−1 for Grovnes Peninsula– indicate high concentrations of low-coercivity magnetic minerals. The magnetic minerals are coarse-grained in the multidomain and pseudo-single domain range, and the significant correlation between some magnetic parameters suggests the dominant control of multidomain grains. The remanent acquisition coercivity H1/2 shows mean (±S.D.) values of 38.2 (±4.9) for Broknes and 38.3 (±3.7) mT for Grovnes soils suggesting magnetite dominance. The soils lie in the sand and loamy sand textural classes, and the concentration of organic matter is very low. Values of percentage frequency-dependent susceptibility indicate insignificant proportions of superparamagnetic grains, and therefore no significant evidence for pedogenic magnetic minerals was observed in these soils. The magnetic signal of Larsemann Hills soils was primarily terrigenous with no contributions from bacterial magnetite, authigenic greigite and anthropogenic magnetic minerals.
