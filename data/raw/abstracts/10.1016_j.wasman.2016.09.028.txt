This research focused on the mineral phase transformation under varied ignition conditions with the objective of estimating loss-on-ignition (LOI) parameter in municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash residues. LOI is commonly used to measure the volatile species, unburned carbon and moisture in the solid materials. There are criteria for LOI measurement in some research fields, while there is no standard protocol for LOI measurement in MSWI fly ash. Using thermogravimetry technique, the ignition condition candidates were proposed at 440/700/900°C for 1 and 2h. Based on X-ray diffractometry results, obvious mineral phase transformation occurred as a function of ignition temperature variation rather than ignition time. Until 440°C, only some minor phases disappeared comparing with the original state. Significant mineral phase transformations of major phases (Ca- and Cl-based minerals) occurred between 440 and 700°C. The mineral phase transformation and the occurrence of newly-formed phases were determined not only by the ignition condition but also by the content of the co-existing components. Mineral phase components rarely changed when ignition temperature rose from 700 to 900°C. Consequently, in order to prevent critical damages to the original mineralogical composition of fly ash, the lowest ignition temperature (440°C) for 2h was suggested as an ideal measurement condition of LOI in MSWI fly ash.
