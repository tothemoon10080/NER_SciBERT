Green coffee has a total mineral content of approximately 4% (dry weight). Yet, the amounts are highly influenced by processing procedures, starting in the field. Numerous studies corroborate the potential of elemental profile as an authenticity marker, since it carries information of coffee geographical origin as well as of the agricultural practices applied. Mineral pattern variations due to dry or wet processing, decaffeination or roasting are also significant; though, depending on the brewing method selection, a more evident distinction is experimented. Valuable coffee by-products are also obtained, particularly regarding their mineral content, which can be recovered and further used. Several instrumental methods of analysis are used, with atomic absorption and emission spectrometry being the foremost analyses chosen to estimate mineral amounts in green, roasted, soluble coffees, coffee brews and its remains.
