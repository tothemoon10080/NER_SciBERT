Oxidation of dissolved iron from ferrous to ferric has been investigated on a sample of acid mine drainage using chemical and biological methods. Hydrogen peroxide, calcium peroxide and ozone were the chemical oxidants; biological oxidation was conducted in the presence of thiobacillus ferrooxidans. The methods are compared technically and economically.
