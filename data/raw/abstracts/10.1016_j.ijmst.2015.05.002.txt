Hydrodynamic cavitaion venturi tube technique is used for pico and nano bubble generations in coal column flotation. In order to determine the optimal design of hydrodynamic cavitation venture tube for pico and nano bubble generation, a four-factor three-level Central Composite Design of Experimental was conducted for investigating four important design parameters of cavitation venturi tube governing the median size and the volume of pico and nano bubbles. The test results showed that maximum volume of pico and nano bubbles, 65–75%, and minimum mean pico and nano bubble size, 150–240nm, were achieved at the medium ratio of the diameter of outlet of the venturi-tube and diameter of throat (3–4), medium outlet angle (11–13°), high inlet angle (26–27°) and high ratio of the length of the throat and the diameter of throat (2.3–3). Study the effects of the producing pico and nano bubbles on fine coal flotation was performed in a 5cm diameter 260cm height flotation column. The optimal percentage of pico and nano bubbles was about 70%, which produced maximum combustible material recovery of 86% with clean coal ash content of 11.7%.
