Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) was investigated for mineral acid (H2SO4) recycling from membrane distillation (MD) concentrate treating gold mining wastewater. Five extractants (Alamine 336, Aliquat 336, Cyanex 923, TEHA, and Versatic Acid) were preferably diluted in kerosene or 1-decanol (30 vol%) in extraction experiments conducted at 60 °C. Cyanex 923 extracts the mineral acid mainly by solvation of the neutral species, whereas the mechanisms for amine-based extractants involve an ion-pair formation. An important outcome was the temperature contribution to extraction efficiency. The endothermic nature of extraction would be advantageous to acid recovery and the integration of MD with LLE considering that the MD concentrated is produced at ∼ 60 °C. If stripping is considered, Aliquat 336 (diluted in 1-decanol), Cyanex 923, and TEHA (diluted in 1-decanol) become the most appropriate organic phases for mineral acid recycling given the greater efficiency for acid recovery (>90%) after a single contact stage. The results for extraction efficiency, selectivity, stripping efficiency, and costs demonstrated that TEHA (30 vol% in 1-decanol) was the most cost-effective (US$ 0.57/kg) alternative for mineral acid recycling. It would be possible to recover 4.8 kg of mineral acid per cubic meter of MD concentrate as an acid solution (concentration: 25 mmol/L). Overall, LLE was a feasible alternative to enhance gold mining wastewater exploitation and MD concentrate management. From a broader perspective, acid recycling would imply environmental gains, economical savings given the lower requirements of neutralizing agents for mining wastewater treatment and residual sludge disposal, or additional incomes by its commercialization.
