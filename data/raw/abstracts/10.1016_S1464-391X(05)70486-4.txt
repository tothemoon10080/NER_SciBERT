Polymer compounds highly loaded with particulated fillers are widely used in extrusion processes. The mineral filler plays a crucial role in achieving certain physical or functional properties. Low Smoke, Free of Halogen (LSFOH) compounds used for fire retardant cables represent a particularly important class of materials within this field. The development of LSFOH compounds has seen many improvements in extrusion behaviour, but there are still some problems regarding restrictions in extrusion performance and therefore the economics of LSFOH cable extrusion. New processing aids specifically designed to solve the extrusion behaviour of highly filled compounds are now permitting further improvements. Dr. Reiner Sauerwein of Nabaltec GmbH describes a new mineral-based processing aid concept.
