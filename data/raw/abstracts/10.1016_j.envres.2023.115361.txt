The Fenton process is a widely used to remedy organic wastewaters, but it has problems of adding H2O2, low utilization efficiency of H2O2 and low mineralization efficiency. Here, a new photocatalysis-self-Fenton process was exploited for the removal of persistent 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) pollutant through coupling the photocatalysis of 4-carboxyphenylboronic acid edge covalently modified g-C3N4 (CPBA-CN) with Fenton. In this process, H2O2 was in situ generated via photocatalysis over CPBA-CN, the photogenerated electrons assisted the accelerated regeneration of Fe2+ to improve the utilization efficiency of H2O2, and the photogenerated holes facilitated the enhancement of 4-CP mineralization. Under the conjugation of CPBA, the electronic structure of CN was optimized and the molecular dipole was enhanced, resulting in the deepening valence band position, accelerated electron-hole pair separation, and improved O2 adsorption-activation. Therefore, the incremental 4-CP degradation rate in the CPBA-CN photocatalysis-self-Fenton process was approaching 0.099 minâˆ’1, by a factor of 3.1 times compared with photocatalysis. The parallel mineralization efficiency increased to 74.6% that was 2.1 and 2.6 times than photocatalysis and Fenton, respectively. In addition, this system maintained an excellent stability in the recycle experiment and can be potentially applied in a wide range of pHs and under the coexistence of various ions. This study would provide new insights for improving Fenton process and promote further development of Fenton in organic wastewater purification.
