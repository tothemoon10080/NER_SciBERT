Sampling ports were firstly drilled on a ZGM95 coal mill in the power plant in China, and the coal samples from various points in the pulverizer were collected under the different operation conditions. The property of the sampling material from the mill was analyzed, applying the float–sink test, size distribution analysis, proximate analysis and so on. It was indicated that the +250μm fraction in the pulverized fuel accounted for only 0.02%, while it was 83.2% in the new feed. The circulating ratio and coal flow in the separator and the cone zone were calculated using the mass balance of the circulating load. So, the circulating ratio in the separator of the pulverizer was between 8 and 13, and the circulating ratio, the feed flow of separator and cone zone all raised with the increase of the air volume. Furthermore, the parameters of the separation functions were obtained based on the fitting method. It was shown that the mean value of the shape factor B was 0.7617, and the parameter D which is the particle size at 50% cumulative yield in the separator almost kept unchanged.
