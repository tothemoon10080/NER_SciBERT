Regional resource synergies (exchanges of by-products, water and energy between companies) in areas with concentrations of minerals processing provide a significant avenue towards sustainable resource processing. Since 2003, the Centre for Sustainable Resource Processing (CSRP) has supported a research program to foster regional synergies developments. Current projects concentrate on two Australian regions, Kwinana in Western Australia, and Gladstone in Queensland. Building upon the many diverse synergies that already exist in these regions, the research provides practical assistance to industry with the identification and development of new synergies that have sound business cases plus strong sustainability benefits. To complement these applied activities, a customised practically-orientated toolkit is being developed for the systematic identification and evaluation of synergy opportunities and assessment of appropriate technologies. This paper highlights the leading research outcomes and experiences from the CSRP Regional Synergies Program and outlines how the toolkit and expertise can be applied in other industrially intense regions.
