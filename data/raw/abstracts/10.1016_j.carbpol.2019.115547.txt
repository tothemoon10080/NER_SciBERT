Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is widespread in mineralized tissues and is considered to play crucial roles during the mineralization process. However, its role in biomineralization remains controversial. In the present study, CS is immobilized to collagen fibrils to mimic its state in biomineralization. The results demonstrate that immobilized CS on collagen fibrils accelerates calcium phosphate nucleation and significantly promotes collagen mineralization by accumulating calcium ions in collagen fibrils. The stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy results confirm that CS gives the specific nucleation sites for calcium phosphate to preferentially form, the improved intrafibrillar heterogeneous nucleation of calcium phosphate facilitates intrafibrillar mineralization. It is found remarkably accelerated remineralization of CS immobilized demineralized dentin is achieved. This study offers insight on the understanding of the function of the biomacromolecule CS on the biomineralization front. In addition, CS effectively promotes intrafibrillar mineralization, which highlights fine prospect for CS to reconstruct collagen-mineralized tissues as a natural material.
