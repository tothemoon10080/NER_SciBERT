While the Mediterranean coastal region of the Nile Delta is critical socioeconomically, it is under significant environmental stress due to the growing load from diverse land-based activities. This study examines the fluctuations in the concentrations of several minerals in sediments from depths ranging from 10 to 50Â m. This study is considering the first work that carries the identification of different minerals by using two different techniques: Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction technique (XRD), in this area. At the same time, the particle size was also assessed. The particle size analyzer (PSA) results showed that the grain size analyses in the sediments varied between slightly gravelly sand, slightly gravelly mud, and silty sand. Mineral identification using FTIR and XRD analysis proved that some minerals such as aragonite, calcite, quartz, kaolinite, montmorillonite, albite, muscovite, and microcline have been presented in most of the studied locations.
