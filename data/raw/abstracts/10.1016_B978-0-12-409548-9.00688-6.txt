Decomposition is the process of metabolic degradation of organic matter (e.g., plant residues, animal tissues and microbial material) into simple organic and inorganic compounds. Decomposition is essentially a process of breakdown of the organic matter carbon skeleton with consequent liberation of energy. Three major processes are generally involved in terrestrial decomposition: leaching, fragmentation and chemical alteration. Decomposition and subsequent mineralization are indispensable for sustaining life on Earth, as they are the only processes enabling massive recycling of chemical elements in the biosphere. Mineralization is the conversion of nutrients and other substances from an organically bound form to a water-soluble inorganic form. Decomposition and mineralization are closely related processes: mineralization is often considered as a subset of decomposition, while decomposition does not always lead to mineralization. Decomposition is generally associated with the carbon cycle whereas mineralization contributes to nutrient cycling.
