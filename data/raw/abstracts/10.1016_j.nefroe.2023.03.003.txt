As in 2011, when the Spanish Society of Nephrology (SEN) published the Spanish adaptation to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) universal Guideline on Chronic Kidney Disease–Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD–MBD), this document contains an update and an adaptation of the 2017 KDIGO guidelines to our setting. In this field, as in many other areas of nephrology, it has been impossible to irrefutably answer many questions, which remain pending. However, there is no doubt that the close relationship between the CKD–MBD/cardiovascular disease/morbidity and mortality complex and new randomised clinical trials in some areas and the development of new drugs have yielded significant advances in this field and created the need for this update. We would therefore highlight the slight divergences that we propose in the ideal objectives for biochemical abnormalities in the CKD–MBD complex compared to the KDIGO suggestions (for example, in relation to parathyroid hormone or phosphate), the role of native vitamin D and analogues in the control of secondary hyperparathyroidism and the contribution of new phosphate binders and calcimimetics. Attention should also be drawn to the adoption of important new developments in the diagnosis of bone abnormalities in patients with kidney disease and to the need to be more proactive in treating them. In any event, the current speed at which innovations are taking place, while perhaps slower than we might like, globally drives the need for more frequent updates (for example, through Nefrología al día).
