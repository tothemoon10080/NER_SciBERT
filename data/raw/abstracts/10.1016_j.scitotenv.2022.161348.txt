Soil erosion is a key problem of erosion in Pisha sandstone areas, and microbially induced calcium carbonate deposition is a bioconsolidation technique with soil improvement potential. There is more limited information available on the uniformity of the distribution of microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation mediated by Pisha sandstone grains and on the influence of mineral composition on calcium carbonate bonding mechanisms. In this study, the curing mechanism of Pisha sandstone particles under the microbially induced calcium carbonate deposition technique was investigated by unconfined compressive strength tests, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The results showed that the self-adsorption biphasic injection method was effective in regulating the homogeneous distribution of microorganisms, and the addition of an additive solvent promoted the homogeneous distribution of bacteria, but the contribution to the mechanical properties was not obvious when urea was used as an additive solvent. The analysis revealed that montmorillonite on the surface of Pisha sandstone particles had an adsorption effect on the bacteria. In addition, the microorganisms induced the transformation of the montmorillonite phase to the illite phase during the biological treatment. Combined Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the CO bond in biogenic calcium carbonate, the SiO bond in Pisha sandstone particles, undergoes intermolecular hydrogen bonding under the modulating effect of the metabolites of microorganisms, and the anionic coordinating group of the extracellular polymer can form a stronger electrostatic interaction with calcium ions, requiring more energy for decomposition. This work provides a case study of microbially induced calcite deposition to improve loose Pisha sandstone, and at the same time, it is not difficult to see how Pisha sandstone particles, as weakly cemented sands, could be a suitable vehicle for a potential microbial consolidation process.
