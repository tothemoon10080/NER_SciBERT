Apatite is one of the most common minerals found in a wide variety of rocks. It has variations of minor and trace elements in its composition that allow the recognition of its host lithotype. In this study, apatite grains identified in rock samples and grains recovered from heavy mineral concentrates in the Angico dos Dias Carbonatite Complex region, located on the border between the State of Bahia and the south of the State of Piauí, Brazil, were analyzed using an electron probe microanalyzer. These concentrates come from alluvial sediments downstream of the carbonatitic body from drainage channels. Sampling was guided by regional geochemical analytical results for the chemical elements of apatite. Grains were detected in alluvial covers for up to 9.5 km downstream in all fraction including coarse sand (1.0 mm) in proximal samples and up to medium sand fractions (0.50 mm) in distal samples. The 96 analytical results on 48 apatite grains show that most have chemical signatures characteristic of metacarbonatitic lithotypes (SrO 0.88–1.7 wt%) and that some host lithotypes were affected by the substituition processes (Si + LREE (Ce+La+Nd) 0.15–0.59 apfu), which may be an alternative to metasomatic fenitization. Statistical analysis by principal component analysis (PCA) helped the visualization and interpretation of the data by constructing clusters of the different compositions of apatite. The apatite fields of carbonatitic and silicate source rocks were separated and associated with the results obtained for alluvial apatite grains, resulting in carbonatitic derivation. The results of using this prospecting tool were satisfactory. Thus, it was possible to classify and detect the sources of alluvial apatite grains relating them to the Angico dos Dias carbonatite body, in addition to proposing a new potential area for the occurrence of carbonatitic bodies northeast of the Angico dos Dias phosphate deposit.
