Beneficiation of coal of âˆ’4.76mm+3mm size fraction was investigated in a laboratory model Denver jig. Process variables were studied to analyze their effect on the performance of jig in terms of yield and ash content of clean coal. Three-factor three-level Box-Behnken design of experiments with response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to understand the performance behavior of jig. From the study, the bed height was found to be the most significant parameter affecting the yield and ash content of clean coal. It was possible to reduce the ash content from 24.32% in feed to an ash content of 16.55% in clean coal at 2L/min water flow rate and 10min jigging time. Influence of operating variables of the jig on responses was presented and discussed in 3D surface plots. The developed model was found to be significant within the range of parameters under investigation with correlation of co-efficient values as 0.99 (yield) and 0.98 (ash).
