The Permian Kupferschiefer horizon in Southwest Poland acted as a geochemical trap by accumulating metals from an ascending oxidizing brine. The hydrogen-rich organic material in the Kupferschiefer supplied sufficient reduction equivalents for the precipitation of base and precious metals from these brines by redox reactions. This is indicated by regular changes in the molecular composition of the extractable organic material in a set of samples collected from a 1.4 m thick horizon in a Polish mine.
                  The degree of oxidation is shown to change drastically from the bottom to the top of the horizon. In the bottom section, saturated hydrocarbons are diminished and heteroaromatic systems containing oxygen and sulphur are enriched significantly; alkylated aromatic hydrocarbon abundances are relatively low. The ratio of phenanthrene/sum of methylphenanthrenes varies with the degree of oxidation. Spectral fluorescence measurements reveal an increase in fluorescence intensities of the extracts with increasing oxidation. Moreover, the green shift of fluorescence maxima is related to oxidation effects. Parallel to the intensity of oxidation, as observed from changes in the extractable organic matter, the content of copper and silver changes within the horizon. The results confirm that organic matter in sediments, under appropriate geological conditions, can play a significant role in ore formation processes.
