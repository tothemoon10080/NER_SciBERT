Due to livestock wastewater irrigation, soil is becoming one of the major sinks of antibiotics in the environment. Recently, it is getting recognized that a variety of minerals under low moisture conditions can induce strong catalytic hydrolysis to antibiotics. However, the relative importance and implication of soil water content (WC) for natural attenuation of soil residual antibiotics has not been well recognized. In order to explore the optimal moisture levels and the key soil properties dominating for the high catalytic hydrolysis activities of soils, this study collected 16 representative soil samples across China, and assessed their performances to degrade chloramphenicol (CAP) under different moisture levels. The results showed that the soils with low organic matter contents (< 20 g/kg) and high amounts of crystalline Fe/Al were particularly effective in catalyzing CAP hydrolysis when exposed to low WC (< 6%, wt/wt), leading to CAP hydrolysis half-lives of <40 d Higher WC greatly suppressed the catalytic activity of the soil. By utilizing this process, it is possible to integrate abiotic and biotic degradation to enhance the mineralization of CAP, attributing to that the hydrolytic products are more available for soil microorganisms. As expected, the soils experienced periodic dry-to-wet moisture conditions (i.e., the WC shifting from 1 to 5% to 20–35%, wt/wt) exhibited higher degradation and mineralization of 14C-CAP, in comparison with the constant wet treatment. Meanwhile, the bacterial community composition and the specific genera showed that the dry-to-wet fluctuation of soil WC relieved the antimicrobial stress to bacterial community. Our study verifies the critical role of soil WC in mediating the natural attenuation of antibiotics, and guides to remove antibiotics from both wastewater and soil.
