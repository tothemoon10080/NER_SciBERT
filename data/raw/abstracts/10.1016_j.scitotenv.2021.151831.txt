Despite the massive accumulation of nanoplastics (NPs) in the freshwater system, research so far has highly focused on the marine environment. NPs interaction with mineral surfaces can influence their fate in freshwater, which will further impact their bioavailability and transport to the oceans. Current work focuses on understanding NPs interaction with weathering sequence of minerals in freshwater under varying geochemical conditions. Primary mineral feldspar and weathering originated secondary minerals, i.e., kaolinite and gibbsite, were investigated for interaction with NPs under batch mode under relevant environmental conditions. Minerals-NPs interaction was also investigated in natural water samples. Results showed that the amorphous nature, small particle size, and positive surface charge of gibbsite resulted in multi-fold sorption of NPs (108.1 mg/g) compared to feldspar (7.7 mg/g) and kaolinite (11.9 mg/g). FTIR spectroscopy revealed hydrogen bonding and complexation as major players in gibbsite-NPs interaction suggesting the possibility of their co-precipitation. The continuous adsorption-desorption and limited sorption capacity of feldspar and kaolinite can be attributed to their negative surface charge, larger size, crystalline nature, and physical sorption. Therefore, both minerals may co-transport and enhance the mobility of NPs.
