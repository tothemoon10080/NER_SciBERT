This study investigates whether resource due diligence in the regulation of conflict minerals has modified the interests and behaviors of actors involved in conflict minerals trade in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, including the government, governments of neighboring countries, Western governments, conflict actors (including armed groups and military forces), companies, and international aid organizations. This study argues that although the regulations have led to behavioral changes in actors, they have not led to changes at the mechanism level. Through this argument, we aim to provide a basis for discussing crucial policy changes required for conflict minerals regulation, so that it may function as a way to resolve conflicts and introduce changes in the mechanisms linking minerals and conflicts.
