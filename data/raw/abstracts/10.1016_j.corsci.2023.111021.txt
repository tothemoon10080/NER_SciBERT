In our previous work, a novel robustness mineralized layer was prepared on surface of AZ80–0.38Nd (wt%) alloy, which mainly consisted of rod-like structure MgCO3•3 H2O and flake structure 4MgCO3•Mg(OH)2•4 H2O. The mineralized layer exhibited outstanding robustness structure. While its corrosion protection for magnesium alloy has not been explored. In this paper, the corrosion behavior and protective performance of the robustness mineralized layer were investigated via hydrogen evolution and electrochemical measurements, systematically. The results show that the mineralized layer exhibited excellent anti-corrosion property in the NaCl solution compared with the oxide layer, due to the outstanding impermeability. And the mineralized layer presented better corrosion passivation and micro-galvanic corrosion inhibition effects due to the characteristics of slight defects and good adhesion to matrix. Besides, the mineralized layer could launch CO3
                     2− during degradation of corrosion, which slowed down the penetration of Cl− across the layer and inhibited the attack of Cl− on magnesium substrate. The fabrication of robustness mineralized layer on magnesium alloys surface provides a novel effective strategy for improving the corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys.
