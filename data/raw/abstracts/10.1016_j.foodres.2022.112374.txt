Despite the well-known beneficial function of Zn in human health, its deficiency is an increasingly recognized worldwide concern. In this work, we evaluated the agronomic biofortification of two basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) cultivars (‘Aroma 2’ and ‘Eleonora’) using nutrient solutions with different Zn concentrations (0, 12.5, 25, 37.5, and 50 µM). We focused on the impact of biofortification on the mineral profile quantified by ICP OES. Compared to the control, biofortification treatments increased Zn concentration by 22.03 % (on average). Consumption of one serving of 50 µM of Zn biofortified basil ‘Aroma 2’ guarantees an estimated daily intake (EDI) of 275.746 and 91.915 µg day−1 in adults and children, respectively. Furthermore, Zn biofortification positively affected the mineral profile of the leaves. Compared to the control, the B50 dose of Zn (50 μM of Zn) increased the EDI of macro and microelements in adults and children. This aspect highlights how biofortified basil consumption would improve consumers’ nutritional status.
