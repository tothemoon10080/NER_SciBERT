Microgreens are an increasingly popular type of nutritionally dense green leafy vegetables. Being eaten raw, they can contribute to a healthier diet being a rich source of essential nutrients such as minerals, vitamins, and bioactive metabolites. This study reports for the first time the mineral profile, obtained by ICP-OES (20 elements plus nitrate), of six hemp varieties grown as a microgreen. Moreover, we evaluated the bioaccumulation capacity of heavy metals. The data indicated that hemp microgreens are above all a good source of K (22.2 ± 2 mg kg−1 fw; mean ± s.e.) and Ca (12.6 ± 2 mg kg−1 fw), among the macrolements, and Fe (145.1 ± 4 μg kg−1 fw) and Zn (10.4 ± 0.4 μg kg−1 fw), among the microelements. Considering the RDA, microgreens are particularly valuable in meeting the nutrient requirement of Se (on average, 33.9 % of the RDA). Moreover, although hemp is being associated with soil bioremediation, microgreens do not have a notable tendency to accumulate toxic heavy metals in the edible fraction. Our results highlighted the ample variation among cultivars and imply that in our controlled conditions the genetic factor has a predominant role in establishing the elemental profile. Our study indicates that hemp microgreens can provide a rich and specific contribution of mineral elements to the human diet, and it paves the way for the exploitation of this industrial crop in the lucrative microgreen sector.
