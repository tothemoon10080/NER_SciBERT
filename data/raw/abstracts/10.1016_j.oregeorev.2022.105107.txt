The spatial association of hydrocarbons with metalliferous ore deposits, like MVT lead–zinc deposits, sandstone uranium deposits and various type gold deposits (epithermal Au-Ag (-Hg) deposits, orogenic gold deposits and Carlin-type gold deposits) is found worldwide. However, the genetic relationship between hydrocarbon evolution and mineralization is still under controversy. Integrating isotope dates related to timing of petroleum evolution and gold mineralization from published data, as well as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of pyrobitumen, electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) on both pyrobitumen and pyrite, the In-situ S isotope analyses of the gold-bearing pyrite in this study, we consider different type hydrocarbons (liquid oil and gas) played different roles on the mineralization of Carlin type gold deposits. As the residue of liquid oil cracking, the widespread high maturity pyrobitumen within the reservoir indicate both oil and gas has ever accumulated in the Nanpanjiang Basin. The high gold abundance (EPMA: ∼120 ppm; TEM: ∼1500 ppm) within the pyrobitumen in agreement with the metal solubility experiment suggest liquid oils could have acted as gold carrier before metal precipitation. The late Triassic timing overlapping between gas generation and gold mineralization and the δ34S features with gold bearing pyrite ∼ 10 ‰ lighter than the coeval seawater sulfate indicate gas dominated TSR process may play an important role on the supply of gold bisulfide complex (Au(HS)2
