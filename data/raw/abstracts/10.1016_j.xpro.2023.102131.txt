Here, we present a protocol for controllable biomimetic mineralization at the nano-scale, simulating natural ion-enriched sedimentary mineralization. We describe steps for treatment of metal-organic frameworks with polyphenol-mediated stabilized mineralized precursor solution. We then detail their use as templates to assemble metal-phenolic frameworks (MPFs) with mineralized layers. Furthermore, we demonstrate the therapeutic benefits of MPF delivery by hydrogel to the full-thickness skin defect model in rats.
                  For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Zhan etÂ al. (2022).
