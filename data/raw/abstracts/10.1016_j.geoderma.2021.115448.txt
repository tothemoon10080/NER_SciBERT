Interactions between organic carbon (OC) and minerals represent a critical mechanism for stabilizing organic matter in soils. Because both mineral weathering and plant productivity are negatively affected by soil erosion, mineral-associated organic carbon (MOC) chemistry is also expected to vary with erosion intensity. Here we show that MOC chemistry, determined by carbon X-ray absorption near-edge fine structure spectroscopy (XANES), exhibits little difference across a large (10-fold) gradient in erosion-derived soil turnover times. Mineral-associated OC chemistry further fails to explain the variation in radiocarbon-based MOC turnover times. Our results suggest that soil OC longevity is largely independent of organic matter chemistry in steep mountainous landscapes where soil development is constrained by erosion.
