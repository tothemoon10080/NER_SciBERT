South China developed large-scale Mesozoic magmatism and polymetallic mineralization, especially Jurassic W-Sn and Mo-W mineralization. Compared with W-Sn deposits, Mo-W deposits in South China have received less attention. The recently discovered Gangmei Mo-W deposit, which occurred in Guangdong Province, is the southernmost Jurassic Mo-W mineralization in South China. Here, we report the molybdenite Re-Os isotopic age of the Gangmei deposit and compile the Mo-W- and W-Sn-associated deposits in South China and their Re concentrations in molybdenites, aiming at constraining the ore-forming age of the Gangmei deposit, the scope of Mo-W mineralization in South China and the possible controlling factors of different mineralization types. Four molybdenite samples from the Gangmei deposit were chosen for Re-Os isotopic dating. The Re-Os model ages vary from 162.6 ± 1.6 Ma to 164.1 ± 1.6 Ma with a weighted mean age of 163.1 ± 1.4 Ma and yield an isochron age of 162.2 ± 4.1 Ma (MSWD = 1.01), consistent with the emplacement age of the Gangmei intrusion, indicating a genetic relationship between magmatic activity and mineralization. This age also agrees well with the large-scale Jurassic Mo-W- and W-Sn-associated mineralization in South China, suggesting that the scope of Jurassic Mo-W-associated mineralization can reach the southernmost part of South China. Rhenium concentrations in molybdenites from Jurassic Mo-W-associated and W-Sn-associated deposits in South China suggest that their magma sources are different, and Mo-W-associated deposits may involve more mantle-derived materials. In addition, oxygen fugacity may be another factor controlling different types of mineralization in South China.
