This research aimed to generate basic data for specifying the macro mineral requirements of beef bulls. Hence, the contents of the macro minerals calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, sulfur, and magnesium in the empty body and body tissue fractions of growing Fleckvieh (German Simmental) bulls with 120–780 kg live weight were determined. Results were used to calculate mineral gain rates in bulls within a wide weight range from 100 to 800 kg live weight. Calcium and phosphorus represented the largest shares in the animals' bodies. Body mineral content changed during animal growth due to progressing bone mineralization and increasing amounts of fat in all body tissues. Peak mineral gain rates were observed for calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium during the 200–400 kg live weight range. The gain rates of sodium, potassium, and sulfur declined steadily during cattle growth. The provided data allow to adjust the existing values of net mineral requirements of growing Fleckvieh bulls within the factorial requirement calculation method.
