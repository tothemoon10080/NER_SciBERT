Dietary trace minerals have profound functions in broiler breeder reproduction. Organic hydroxy analog of methionine (HMTBa) trace minerals have been included at lower levels in poultry feeds compared to inorganic sources without affecting performance and in some cases improving it. We compared 3 breeder hen trace mineral blends of economic interest to a large U.S. integrator. Treatment diets (fed wk 26–65) provided Zn, Mn, and Cu (mg/kg), respectively: CTL = control, predominantly inorganic trace minerals (143–180–123); ORG = reduced levels using solely HMTBa trace minerals (50–60–15); and MIX = a blend of inorganic/HMTBa trace minerals (75/25–90/30–22.5/7.5). On average, ORG-fed hens were 1.3 and 1.1% heavier compared to CTL and MIX hens, respectively (P = 0.002). Overall (wk 25–65), hens fed the MIX diet had higher egg production (P < 0.001) and laid heavier eggs (P = 0.038) compared to hens fed the CTL or ORG diet. During the second half of lay, MIX-fed hens showed improved eggshell quality (P ≤ 0.037) and cuticle deposition (P = 0.019). Fertility and hatchability were unaffected by diet (P ≥ 0.205). Broilers hatched from young ORG hens (29 wk) had higher bone mineral density (P = 0.004) and after a 7-day grow-out (P = 0.047) when obtained from ORG hens of 41 wk of age. In conclusion, the industry levels provided by combining inorganic and HMTBa trace minerals in breeder hen diets were advantageous for sustaining high-quality settable egg production.
