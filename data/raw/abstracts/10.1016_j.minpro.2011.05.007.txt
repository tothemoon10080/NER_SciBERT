Treatment of flotation slurries, waste waters containing a large amount of: solid particles, dissolved air or gas, chemicals etc. imposes centrifugal separation as one of the technically and economically acceptable solutions. There are numerous technical solutions and devices which use the centrifugal force for: separation, classification, dewatering, etc., in mineral processing, waste water treatment, etc. The separator that we hereby present, removing some of the noted deficiencies on the existing solutions, introduces improvements in the sphere of self-suction, continual discharge and product transport. It is significant that this new solution can be used for the treatment of flotation tailings containing large amounts of finest particles.
                  Displaying the innovative separator solution, the author analyses the existing theoretical separation basis and while noting certain weaknesses, forms a new approach to defining separation capacities. The theoretical and constructive innovations have been tested, using the separator prototype and displaying the acquired results.
                  The aim of the research is to acquire accurately defined data based on which not only the designer, but the user as well, would be able to choose the most suitable solution for its problem. The secondary, but not less important aim, is to respond to the requests of a potential user: “Suva Ruda”-Raška Flotation.
