The technique of ion flotation provides a simple physical method for concentrating the ions present in very dilute liquors. The ions in the liquor, with the aid of a suitable surfactant, adsorb at the surface of rising air bubbles, and report to a froth product. The purpose of this article is to provide the mineral processing industry with a structured and up to date review of the ion flotation subject, to examine some recent developments, and to indicate some potential applications of the technique. Following a discussion of the ion flotation phenomenology and general nomenclature, important issues concerning the product grade, the selectivity of reagents, flotation kinetics, and other operating variables are examined. Finally, the potential applications of ion flotation are discussed, and an economic analysis of a gold ion flotation process is presented. The main conclusion is that developments in ion flotation will occur in areas such as gold recovery and mine-site remediation. Here, the benefits offset the risks associated with the introduction of this, essentially, new technology.
