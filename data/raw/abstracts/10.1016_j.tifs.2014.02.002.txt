Phytate, phenolic compounds and fiber are known anti-nutritional factors (ANFs) that contribute to the low bioaccessibility and bioavailability of iron and zinc in plant foods. Better insight into the localization of minerals and anti-nutritional factors in plant tissues, as well as on the mechanisms of interaction between minerals and ANFs, may lead to better targeted processing for improvement of the bioaccessibility of minerals in plant foods. This review highlights the subcellular distribution of iron and zinc and their ANFs in plant organs, as well as the mechanisms of interaction between these metals and their ANFs. These insights are then used to better clarify the role of various processing technologies, like mechanical treatments, soaking, germination, fermentation and heating, on improving the bioaccessibility of iron and zinc in plant foods.
