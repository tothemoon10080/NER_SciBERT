The Nanling Metallogenic Belt is a major W-Sn province in South China containing numerous ore deposits formed during a complex history of magma emplacement and mineralization. The Xitian ore field in Hunan Province is a typical example of a late magmatic-metallogenic system. In this study, garnets from skarn-type ores in the Xitian ore field yield a U-Pb age of 231.7 ± 1.3 Ma (n = 33), whereas cassiterite grains from quartz vein-type ores give U-Pb ages of 158 to 154 Ma (n = 72) and 140.7 ± 3.3 Ma (n = 6), suggesting three stages of W-Sn mineralization (Late Triassic, Late Jurassic, and Early Cretaceous). In the Late Triassic skarn-type ores, the REE patterns of scheelite change from MREE-enriched to LREE-enriched with time, whereas the REE patterns of scheelite shift from MREE-enriched to MREE-depleted in the Late Jurassic quartz vein-type ores, indicating diverse metallogenic processes. Differences in the Y/Ho ratios and Sr-O isotope compositions of scheelite further confirm discrete metallogenic pathways for the Late Triassic skarn-type W ore and the Late Jurassic quartz vein-type ore, with fluid-rock interaction of the former dominated by magmatic-hydrothermal fluids whereas the latter was influenced by large amounts of meteoric water. A model emphasizing the evolution from skarn-type to vein-type metallogeny is proposed to account for the complex genesis of multistage W–Sn deposits related to the Xitian granite complex. More generally, this study demonstrates that in-situ LA-ICP(MC)-MS U-Pb dating and isotopic analysis of hydrothermal minerals are powerful tools to decipher the nature, timing, and evolution of multistage W-Sn metallogenic systems.
