To elucidate the role of high valence manganese and surface lattice oxygen in catalyst for catalytic combustion of toluene, herein, a porous LaMnO3 catalyst was firstly fabricated using ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) as a hard-template. Compared with pristine LaMnO3-bulk, the optimal porous LaMnO3 exhibited boosted catalytic performance for toluene combustion, leading to a ∼50 ℃ lower T90% (required temperatures for 90% toluene conversions). The results of N2 adsorption–desorption measurement, X-ray photoelectron spectroscope, O2 temperature-programmed desorption and H2 temperature-programmed reduction indicated that the optimal porous LaMnO3 displayed high molar ratios of surface Mn4+/Mn3+ and Olatt/Oads, which exposed abundant active sites and promoted the preferential low-temperature catalytic oxidation of toluene. Simultaneously, the increased content of high valence manganese (Mn4+) and surface lattice oxygen (Olatt) in porous LaMnO3 catalyst accelerated the cycle of toluene deep oxidation. Combined with the analysis of toluene intermediates by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, the toluene degradation mechanism over porous LaMnO3 was also explored. This work provides a feasible strategy for design of porous Mn-based perovskite catalyst with a high efficiency and stability for catalytic combustion of VOCs.
