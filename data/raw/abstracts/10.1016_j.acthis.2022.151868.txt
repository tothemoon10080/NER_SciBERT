Remodeling of the cementum plays a crucial role in periodontal regenerative therapy, while the precise mechanism of cementogenesis has yet been adequately understood. Recent studies have indicated the connection between osteogenic differentiation and Brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein-1 (Bmal1). Besides, Wnt/β-catenin signaling is proven to be an essential regulator in cementogenesis. In this study, we found a robust expression of Bmal1 in cementoblasts in the mandibular first molar of mice by immunohistochemical staining. To further explore the role of Bmal1 in cementogenesis, we examined the expression pattern of Bmal1 in OCCM-30, an immortalized murine cementoblast cell line by qRT-PCR and western blot. Our data demonstrated the upregulation of Bmal1 at both mRNA and protein levels during differentiation. Additionally, stable knockdown of Bmal1 in OCCM-30 cells resulted in downregulation of osteogenic markers such as alkaline phosphatase (Alp), osteopontin (Opn), and osteocalcin (Ocn), and reduced formation of mineralized nodules. Moreover, qRT-PCR and western blot results exhibited that the expression of β-catenin was attenuated by Bmal1 deficiency. We also found that the mRNA levels of Tcf1 and Lef1, the target transcription factors of β-catenin, were reduced by Bmal1 deficiency. In conclusion, this study preliminarily confirms that Bmal1 promotes cementoblast differentiation and cementum mineralization via Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which contributes to a potential strategy in periodontal regenerative therapy.
