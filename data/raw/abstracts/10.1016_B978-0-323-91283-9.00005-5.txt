Integrating mineral carbonation process into an ultramafic-hosted mine deposit is a win-win scenario for the management of mine waste materials and carbon dioxide. Search for an effective pretreatment method and a proper carbon capture and sequestration routine is of great significance to put forward the integrated mineral carbonation process into industrial practice. This paper summarizes the outcomes related to mechanical activation (MA) on mine waste materials for integrated mineral carbonation process in Turnagain Project. First, through comparison of four classic methods for resolving the microstructure from X-ray diffraction pattern analysis, Rietveld method was found to be the most effective and accurate method for olivine containing materials. Second, MA in both wet and dry milling conditions and carbonation in direct carbonation process were used to test the mechanism of the changes in mine waste materials during the whole process. A higher carbonation sequestration efficiency in a direct aqueous process was reached using the mechanically activated mine waste material (65% forsterite and 30% lizardite) than mechanically activated olivine with the same specific milling energy input. Third, the economic analysis on the integrated mineral carbonation process with MA as pretreatment method was carried out. At the optimized MA and carbonation condition, the operation cost of CO2 avoidance and the CO2 sequestration potential of the Turnagain project were re-evaluated.
