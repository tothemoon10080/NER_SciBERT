Enargite is typically associated with chalcocite. Owing to the similarity in the flotation behaviors of these minerals, both minerals are reported to concentrate in the conventional flotation circuit. However, inorganic arsenic in enargite can decrease the copper concentrate quality and increase the operating cost of processing this concentrate. Separating these minerals is important for cleaner copper production to avoid these effects. In this context, this study investigated the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment on the flotation behavior of chalcocite and enargite. Flotation tests of pure and mixed minerals indicated that H2O2 treatment reduced the floatability of chalcocite and enargite by forming sulfate and copper hydroxide on their surfaces. Despite the detrimental effect of the H2O2 treatment, there was a narrow window of H2O2 concentration for separating both minerals, in which enargite floated and chalcocite was depressed. This selective flotation behavior was caused by the rapid adsorption of potassium amyl xanthate (KAX) and lower surface oxidation of enargite compared with that of chalcocite.
