The present study aims to examine the effectiveness of the catalytic wet peroxidation (CWPO) process for the removal of pyridine bearing wastewater by nanoscale zero-valent iron. In this study, nanoscale zero-valent iron was dispersed uniformly on granular activated carbon (GAC) with the help of chemical reduction method under ethanol atmosphere. N2 adsorption-desorption study demonstrates the possibility of the existence of slit pores in dominant form. The surface area (SBET) of the GAC decreased significantly after nFe0 loading on to the GAC channel to 191 m2/g. Catalytic wet peroxidation process was optimized by examine the influencing experimental parameters such as pH, catalyst dose, hydrogen peroxide and temperature. During CWPO process pyridine and TOC removal with time courses of 300 min at 333 K were evaluated and reached maximum removal 93% and 78%, respectively. Pyridine degradation kinetics followed the two-step first-order kinetics. The activation energy for the first-step and second-step of the oxidation process of pyridine was 33.5 kJ/mol and 19.1 kJ/mol, respectively.
