With the increasing demand for minerals, the development of efficient techniques for mineral recovery is important. The application of image analysis techniques to mineral beneficiation studies is described in this paper. We carry out ore identification not pixel-by-pixel but rather by considering the average reflectance of grains. This is accomplished by first carrying out segmentation, a process in which a facet model based edge operator is used to delineate the boundaries of grains.
