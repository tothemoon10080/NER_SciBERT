Reconstituted milk protein concentrate (RMPC) showed higher thermal stability than reconstituted skimmed milk powder (RSMP) at equal protein level (7.5%); heat coagulation time (HCT) 6.80 and 1.80 min, respectively. RMPC contained lower concentration of milk minerals as compared to RSMP. The total mineral content of RMPC was matched with RSMP using mineral salts, which decreased its HCT to 1.55 min. Individual Ca, Mg, Na and K content of RMPC were also matched. Addition of CaCl2·2H2O and MgCl2·6H2O to RMPC reduced it HCT and made it unsuitable to UHT processing. NaCl added RMPC was UHT stable (UHT run-time>120 min). KCl added samples showed diminished UHT stability (run-time 15 min) and lower overall heat-transfer coefficient. Addition of mineral salts increased protein aggregation. The reduced amount of minerals in RMPC as compared to RSMP, notably potassium content per protein unit, appeared to be responsible for its high heat stability.
