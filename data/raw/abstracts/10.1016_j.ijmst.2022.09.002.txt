As main part of underground rock mass, the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of natural fractures plays an important role in rock mass stability. Based on previous studies on 3D morphology, this study probes into the law and mechanism regarding the influence of the confining pressure constraints on 3D morphological features of natural fractures. First, fracture surfaces were obtained by true triaxial compression test and 3D laser scanning. Then 3D morphological parameters of fractures were calculated by using Grasselli’s model. The results show that the failure mode of granites developed by true triaxial stress can be categorized into tension failure and shear failure. Based on the spatial position of fractures, they can be divided into tension fracture surface, S-1 shear fracture surface, and S-2 shear fracture surface. Micro-failure of the tension fracture surface is dominated by mainly intergranular fracture; the maximum height of asperities on the fracture surface and the 3D roughness of fracture surfaces are influenced by σ

S-1 shear fracture surface and S-2 shear fracture surface are dominated by intragranular and intergranular coupling fracture. The maximum height of asperities on the fracture surface and 3D roughness of fracture surface are affected by σ

                     3, the cutting off of asperities on the fracture surface becomes more common, the maximum height of asperities and 3D roughness of fracture surface further decrease, and the overall uniformity gets further improved. The experimental results are favorable for selecting technical parameters of enhanced geothermal development and the safety of underground mine engineering.
