Focusing the marine euphotic zone, which is the pivotal region for interaction of solar light-mineral-microorganism and the elements cycle, we have conducted the research on the mechanism of semiconducting minerals promoting extracellular electron transfer with microorganisms in depth. Therein, anatase which is one of the most representative semiconducting minerals in marine euphotic zone was selected. The mineralogical characterization of anatase was identified by ESEM, AFM, EDS, Raman, XRD, and its semiconducting characteristics was determined by UV–Vis and Mott-Schottky plots. Determined by the electrochemical measurement of I-t curves, the photocurrent density of anatase was more prominent than dark current density. Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 was widely distributed in the euphotic zone, and its mutants of operons deficient in biosynthesis pyocyanin (Δphz1Δphz2) and pili deficient (ΔpilA) were employed in this study. I-t curves indicated that both direct and indirect extracellular electron transfer processes occurred between anatase and PAO1. The indirect electron transfer depending on pyocyanin secreted by PAO1 was the main electron transfer mode. This work demonstrated the light-driven extracellular electron transfer and further revealed the photo-catalyzed mechanisms between anatase and PAO1 in marine euphotic zone.
