Minerals in rice leaves is a crucial indicator of plant health, and their concentrations can be used to guide plant management. It is important to predict mineral content in contaminated rice rapidly. In this study, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was applied to quantify minerals (Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, and Na) in rice leaves under chromium (Cr) stress. Two feature extraction methods, including principal component analysis (PCA) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were compared to identify important variables that related to mineral concentrations. Results showed that partial least square regression (PLSR) achieved good performance in Ca, Fe Mg, K, Mn, and Na, with correlation coefficient of 0.9782, 0.8712, 0.8933, 0.9206, 0.9856, and 0.9865, root mean square error of 219.25, 14.78, 1192.47, 385.12, 9.56, and 124.32 mg/kg, respectively. In addition, the correlation between different spectral lines were further analyzed. Cr exhibited a positive correlation with Ca, Mg, and Na, and a negative correlation with Mn, Cu, and K. The proposed method provides a high-accuracy and fast approach for minerals prediction in rice leaves under Cr stress, which is important for environmental protection and food safety.
