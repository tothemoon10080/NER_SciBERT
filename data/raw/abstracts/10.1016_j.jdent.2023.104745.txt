Objective
                  The aim of this scoping review was to summarize and discuss the morphological features and associated factors of pulpal mineralizations (PMs) as described within the literature.
               
                  Data
                  The study protocol was registered on the Open Science Framework platform and is available at the following link: https://osf.io/hfqwe. This scoping review was developed according to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines.
               
                  Sources
                  A literature search of four electronic databases was performed in SCOPUS, MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE and Word of Science, with the last search on May 29, 2023. Study selection was completed by two reviewers independently. Data was extracted regarding study characteristics, types, and features of PM and associated factors.
               
                  Study selection
                  Of 1016 studies initially identified ten which qualified were included in this scoping review. Systemic and local factors that result in pulpal insult can contribute to the development of PMs. Three forms of PM have been reported, pulp stones, diffuse mineralizations, and mineralized ectopic connective tissue, with discrete and diffuse mineralization being the two clinically relevant forms. The different forms of PMs exhibit dissimilar morphological features.
               
                  Conclusion
                  Pulpal mineralizations exist in two clinically relevant forms: diffuse and discrete mineralizations and are likely associated with a pulpal insult.
               
                  Clinical significance
                  Understanding the morphology of dental pulp mineralization is the first step to expanding the knowledge of pulp mineralization and could result in improved diagnosis of endodontic pathosis.
