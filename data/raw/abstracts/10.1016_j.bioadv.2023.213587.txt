In this work, Engineered Living Materials (ELMs), based on the combination of genetically-modified bacteria and mineral-reinforced organic matrices, and endowed with self-healing or regenerative properties and adaptation to specific biological environments were developed. Concretely, we produced ELMs combining human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), which was specifically programmed to deliver bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-2) upon external stimulation using nisin, into mineralized alginate matrices. The hybrid organic/inorganic matrix was built through a protocol, inspired by bone mineralization, in which alginate (Alg) assembly and apatite (HA) mineralization occurred simultaneously driven by calcium ions. Chemical composition, structure and reologhical properties of the hybrid 3D matrices were dedicately optimized prior the incorportation of the living entities. Then, the same protocol was reproduced in the presence of hMSC and engineered L. lactis that secrete BMP-2 resulting in 3D hybrid living hydrogels. hMSC viability and osteogenic differentiation in the absence and presence of the bacteria were evaluated by live/dead and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunofluorescence assays, respectively. Results demonstrate that these 3D engineered living material support osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs due to the synergistic effect between HA and the growth factors BMP-2 delivered by L. lactis.
