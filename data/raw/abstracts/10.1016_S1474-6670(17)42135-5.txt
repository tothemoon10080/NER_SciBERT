In this article, a support system for the economic optimal control of industrial plants, is described. The system collects and processes, in real time, the data obtained from sensors and informs the operator about the optimal values of manipulated variables to obtain maximum economic benefits. An application to a grinding-flotation plant for copper mineral processing is also presented.
