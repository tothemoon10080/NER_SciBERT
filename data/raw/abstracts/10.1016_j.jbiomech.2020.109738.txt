Biomimetic mineralization is a promising technique in biomedical applications. To understand the mechanical behavior of biomimetically mineralized collagen material (BMC), we examined the composition and structure of the mineral deposition in BMCs mineralized by the polymer-induced liquid precursor (PILP) process and applied wide angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) with in situ tensile testing to investigate the mineral-to-tissue co-deformation in the material. We found that the PILP process is able to achieve good biomimetic mineralization in bulk collagen matrix. Compositionally, the mineral deposition showed high crystallinity with no carbonation. However, the morphology of extrafibrillar mineral deposition and the preferential crystal orientation were different from natural bone. Further, the Youngâ€™s modulus and mineral-to-tissue co-deformation ratio of the BMC were significantly lower than both natural bone and partially demineralized bone with similar mineral volume fraction. It was concluded that while biomimetic mineralization can achieve good mineral deposition volume in the BMC, the mechanical behavior of the material was different from natural bone.
