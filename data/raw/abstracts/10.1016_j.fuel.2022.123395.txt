The dewatering of oil sands tailings is one of the most challenging problems faced by the oil sands industry. Despite significant efforts in the past several decades, the industry still lacks viable technologies that can quickly dewater and reclaim the oil sands tailings and eliminate their environmental impacts. The poor dewatering of oil sands tailings has been categorially attributed to fine clays and/or residual bitumen, but has not been pinned to specific entities. In this work, the research is focused on investigating the filterability of different types of minerals with an objective to identify the ones that are responsible for the difficult filtration of oil sands tailings. Three different types of minerals, including non-clay minerals (rutile, quartz), non-swelling clays (kaolinite, illite), and swelling clays (illite–smectite, montmorillonite) were selected for the study. The fine mineral solids were characterized by particle size distribution, methylene blue index (or cation exchange capacity), and specific surface area measurements. The dewatering of each mineral was studied using vacuum filtration and capillary suction time measurements. Initial filtration rate and capillary suction time were used to assess the dewatering performance. It was found that particle size was not a primary factor affecting the filterability of the minerals, but the type of mineral is the deciding factor. Non-clay minerals and non-swelling clays were easier to filter than the swelling clays. The presence of the swelling clays, even in small quantities, significantly affected the filterability of other minerals, and it was thus deduced that swelling clays in the oil sands tailings were the main reason for the latter’s poor filterability. The swelling clays were characterized to correlate its composition and structure to filtration behavior using the effective volume fraction of the solids in an aqueous mineral slurry.
