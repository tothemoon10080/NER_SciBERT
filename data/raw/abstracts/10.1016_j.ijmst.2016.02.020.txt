In this research, determination of final slope for Maiduk copper mine of Kerman is investigated according to destabilizing factors of the mine. The development of the Maiduk Mine caused the extension of the mine area and also withdrawal of its wall. So, optimizing possibility of mine slope is essential. Finally, the magnitude of optimized slopes for different walls of the mine in association with executive commands with better factors of safety is provided. The results show that the most important destabilizer factors are the presence of water and pore pressure in the faults and the main joints. With the omission of pore pressure, mine wall for the designed depth is quite stable. This requires a drainage pattern in the lifetime of the mine. In an optimistic point of view, the minimum factor of safety of the wall will be 2.81 even without drainage. This conclusion allows optimizing the slope to its maximum magnitude of 51 degree. With the pessimistic engineering judgment and with the higher SF, the magnitude of the slope is optimized to 47 degree.
