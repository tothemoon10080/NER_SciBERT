Characterizing the loss factor of basic rock-forming minerals is fundamental in understanding the mineral-microwave interactions and predicting the possible weakening effect of microwave on rock. This paper proposed a novel method for deriving the loss factor of minerals based on the microwave heating rate tests, the electromagnetic numerical simulations and the effective medium theory. The heating characteristics of 8 basic rock-forming minerals at 500 W were investigated using a 2.45 GHz single-mode microwave and the minerals were classified into 3 categories based on the heating rate in °C/min/g. Meanwhile, the electric field strengths in the minerals were obtained using electromagnetic simulations and the loss factors of the minerals were calculated based on the effective medium theory. The loss factors calculated were then compared with those measured by the resonant cavity perturbation technique. This method provides an alternative to get the loss factor of minerals from the microwave heating rate tests.
