In the process involving the simultaneous capture and mineralization of CO2, kinetics parameters were derived for the CO2 mineralization reaction using a tube type reactor with a static mixer. Also, the effect of the reaction system using the static mixer on the CO2 conversion efficiency was analyzed using three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (3D-CFD) modeling. The kinetics constants of the overall reaction were calculated from experiments, and the rate constants and activation energies of the individual elementary steps of the overall reaction were also calculated to assess the effects of each of them on the overall reaction. When considering each of the kinetics constants of these individual reactions, the CO2 mineralization reaction was determined to have been in particular greatly affected by the Ca(OH)2 dehydration rate. The obtained rates of CO2 conversion for the cases with and without use of the static mixer were 83.07% and 25.27%, respectively, with this difference attributed to turbulent flow effects of the static mixer. In addition, the CO2 conversion obtained by carrying out CFD modeling of the overall reaction and of the individual reaction steps were 83.07% and 80.91%, respectively.
