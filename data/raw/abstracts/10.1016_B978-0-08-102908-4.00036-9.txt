The ability to locate and produce resources for society requires that access to land be granted. Without access there is nowhere to look and nothing to produce. Traditions rooted in civil and common law form the basis for accessing government and private land in countries around the world. The three main systems by which governments administer and control mineral resources are accessional in which ownership of the land carries with it ownership of the subsurface including all minerals, dominial in which the state owns all minerals regardless of surface land ownership and retains the right to produce these minerals itself, and regalian in which the state owns the subsurface and contained minerals and acts as custodian, making agreements with third parties to produce the minerals, usually in return for some share of the profit. In most countries with accessional systems, land held by the state is usually administered by a regalian system. In actual practice, access to minerals and their production are controlled by finer aspects of these systems including the mechanics of mineral acquisition, degree of private, state and foreign ownership, level of taxation and royalties, and environmental regulations. Custodianship of mineral resources in the future is likely to involve greater state or collective oversight designed to maximize efficient production and use of scarce resources, and minimize the environmental burden resulting from extractive mining activities.
