NaCl is utilized in Şalgam at 1–2% (w/w). The aim of this study was to reduce the NaCl content by addition of different concentrations of KCl and CaCl2 during production and evaluate their effects on quality. An innovation in production process was also employed, specifically dough extraction and use of the resulting liquid as a starter inoculum. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species (13) were identified using a combined approach of (RAPD)-PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus plantarum were dominant, but Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. jonggajibkimchii, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactobacillus coryniformis subsp. coryniformis, Lactobacillus paraplantarum were also found. Mineral compositons were determined using ICP-OES and the most abundant were potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus, respectively. A mixture of NaCl and KCl protected anthocyanin contents and improved colour parameters. Dough extraction also accelerated production of şalgam.
