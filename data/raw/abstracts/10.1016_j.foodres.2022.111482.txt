The most consumed fish species in Portugal do not correspond to the most caught fish species on the Portuguese coast. From the point of view of ocean sustainability and economics, it is important to study unexploited or underexploited fish species that have the potential to be introduced into the food market. This potential can be reflected by their nutritional value, where mineral elements are often overlooked despite their importance in human health. Therefore, it is important to study the elemental concentration of those fish species, which should also include seasonal variations of essential mineral elements such as Ca, P, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, and I, and non-essential elements such as As, Ni, Cd, and Pb.
                  This work is part of a project that studied five fish species with the potential to be brought to the market: three species with low commercial value (Trachurus picturatus, Spondyliosoma cantharus and Trigla lyra) and two species with no commercial value (Serranus cabrilla and Capros aper), caught over a year in the coast of Portugal.
                  Mineral elements were quantified by ICP-OES (ICP-MS for I). The results showed that the studied fish species present significant elemental concentrations, similar to those found in the most caught fish species in Portugal. Trachurus picturatus was found to be a source of Fe, and all species are sources of I. Overall, Spondyliosoma cantharus proved to be the most element-rich species. Sensorially, Cu was related to “metallic odour” and Fe to “metallic flavour”, and I was related to “seaweed odour” and “seawater flavour”. Additionally, toxic elements such as Cd, Pb, Ni and As were not detected. The corresponding Hazard Quotients (HQ) show the safety of the consumption of these fish species concerning the content of potentially toxic elements.
