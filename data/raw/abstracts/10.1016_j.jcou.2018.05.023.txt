The CaCl2-rich distiller waste discharged in the Solvay process has not been recycled comprehensively. A novel CO2 mineralization route with waste CaCl2 solutions via coupled reaction-extraction-crystallization technique was proposed. The effect of Na+, K+, Mg2+, Al3+, NO3
                     − and SO4
                     2− ions which exist in the distiller waste on the conversion of CaCl2 as well as the morphology of product CaCO3 was studied with the aid of titration, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), Particle Size Analyzer, X-ray Diffractometer (XRD), Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and Thermogravimetry (TG). Among the ions, Na+, K+ and NO3- have little influence that could be ignored. Both Al3+ and SO4
                     2− are adsorbed on the surface of vaterite and inhibit the transformation to calcite by lowering down the surface energy. Therefore, small particles with diameters of less than 10 μm even 1 μm which are hard to be filtered are formed. While for Mg2+, the effect is negligible when the content is less than 5 wt %. However, as the content increases, Mg2+ could not only be adsorbed on the surface but also insert into the crystal lattice of CaCO3, forming the worm-like Mg-calcite. Finally, the experiment of simulated distiller waste was investigated to take a very important step towards industrialization.
