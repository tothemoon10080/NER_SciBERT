Recently, fixing CO2 within minerals is an environmentally friendly way of CO2 sequestration and utilization strategy. Inspired by cyanobacteria mediated carbonation of hydrated magnesium carbonates (HMCs), the indirect CO2 biomimetic mineralization process involving NH4HCO3-MgCl2 using NaCMC was investigated to obtain HMCs with complex superstructures. The crystal phase, morphology, structure, thermal stability and surface of HMCs were characterized by XRD, SEM, TG and XPS methods. The HMCs products are composed of urchin-like particles assembled by nesquehonite rods at a low NaCMC concentration. At a higher NaCMC concentration, Dypingite flowers assembled by nanosheets generate in situ at the dissolution defects of nesquehonite rod by increasing the NaCMC concentration. The irregular dypingite agglomerates assembled by adjacent flower-like structures and the well-developed dypingite spheres composed of intensive plate-like crystallites are synthesized at temperature above 65 °C. By adjusting the molar ratio of Mg2+/HCO3
                     −, dypingite flakes grow on the top of nesquehonite rods. The superstructure of HMCs was destroyed when increasing the solution pH from 8 to 10. The decomposition of HMCs is characterized by dehydration (or dehydroxylation) and decarbonation stages. XPS confirms that the surface properties for nesquehonite and dypingite are quite different. This study provides insights into the preparation of HMCs with complex hierarchical structures based on biomimetic carbonation.
