The application of TiO2-based photocatalysts in air pollution control has attracted much attention thanks to their advantageous green and sustainable performance. However, how to improve the degradation efficiency under visible light is still challenging. Herein, we report a ternary three-dimensional “PIZZA”-like Bi2MoO6-TiO2/diatomite (BTD) composite with high-efficient mineralization and recycling performance towards gaseous formaldehyde (HCHO) under visible light. The high-efficient adsorption-photocatalysis collaborative system with intimate interface combination is successfully established among Bi2MoO6 (BMO), TiO2 and diatomite. The HCHO mineralization rate constant of BTD-1:2 composite is up to around 4.03 times and 2.18 times higher than those of bare BMO and binary Bi2MoO6-TiO2 composite, respectively. It is indicated that the introduction of diatomite increases active sites and plays the vital role in the improvement of photocatalysis. In addition, the photogenerated holes (h+) and hydroxyl radical (
                        
                     OH) are proved to be the main active species for HCHO mineralization. Furthermore, there is a competitive adsorption relationship between water (H2O) molecules and HCHO molecules, and both H2O molecules and oxygen (O2) molecules participated in the reaction of HCHO mineralization based on in-situ DRIFTs spectra analysis. Our work would give a new perspective on gaseous HCHO purification.
