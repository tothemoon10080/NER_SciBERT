Clay minerals-based nanocarriers for anti-tuberculosis drugs have attracted a lot of consideration in recent decades owing to their exceptional characteristics including high absorbability, the ability to design multiple drug dosage form, and controlled release of the drug over a period of time. Moreover, clay minerals enhance the solubility of the drug, improves the chemical and physical stability of the drug, and have the potential to deliver the drugs at the target therapeutic sites which are beneficial in the drug delivery field. Recently, these natural nanoclays have been used as nanocarriers for different anti-tuberculosis drugs such as isoniazid, pyrazinamide, rifampicin, ethambutol, and fluoroquinolone for the development of their nanohybrids/nanocomposites against tuberculosis but at present, there are no reviews in this field. This review article discusses the application of different natural nanoclays including halloysite nanotubes, montmorillonite, palygorskite and other smectites as anti-tuberculosis drug carriers. Clay minerals/anti-tuberculosis drug nanohybrids are often incorporated with polymers for the development of novel drug delivery systems with enhanced pharmaceutical performances. Biosafety of the clay minerals, their limitations, and future perspective of clay minerals for the treatment of tuberculosis is also reviewed.
