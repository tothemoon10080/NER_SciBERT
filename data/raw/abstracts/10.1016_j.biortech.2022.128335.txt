Deciphering ecological functions of alkaline phosphatase (phoD)-harboring bacteria in composting systems is crucial but poorly understood. High-throughput sequencing, gene quantification, and statistical analyses were applied to investigate effects of abundance and diversity of phoD-harboring bacteria (PHB) on phosphorus availability during swine manure composting. Results showed that available phosphorus notably increased from 0.5 to 1.43 g kg−1, and physicochemical properties and enzyme activities affected PHB community composition. Phylogenetic signals of PHB responded notably to temperature and phosphorus components, and stochasticity (94.2 %) dominated community assembly. Abundance and diversity of PHB directly and indirectly influenced phosphorus availability, and rare PHB mediated organic phosphorus mineralization. A phosphate-solubilizing bacterium (PSB) Pseudomonas sp. WWJ-22 isolated from compost displayed good efficiency in mineralizing lecithin, demonstrating the highest phosphorus-solubilizing level of 116.3 mg L–1. This study highlights ecological roles of PHB on phosphorus availability and provides a potential PSB candidate for composting.
