As ore deposit discovery rates have slowed significantly despite increased exploration expenditure, there have been developments in conceptual geological targeting to focus exploration into the most prospective districts within potentially well-endowed greenfield terranes. This requires the establishment of superior predictive geological models for sought-after deposit types in greenfield exploration. To facilitate this, research into holistic genetic models has evolved toward hierarchical mineral system models that view mineralization processes progressively from a geodynamic setting through province- and district- to deposit scale. Initiated by Wyborn et al. and championed by Knox-Robinson and Wyborn, this mineral systems concept has become prominent since 2010 as a critical tool for genetic models and conceptual targeting. It has also been applied to the analysis of potential mineral endowment for a variety of mineral commodities. As summarized by Kelley et al., mineral systems models require four main foundation parameters. These are (1) a fertile ore component and fluid source; (2) a suitable geodynamic setting with favorable linked mantle lithosphere; (3) critical crustal architecture for ore-fluid migration to a trap site; and (4) appropriate postmineralization tectonic processes to ensure preservation rather than uplift and destruction. The multiplication effect of the self-organized critical components of the mineral system determines the size and grade of an ore body.
