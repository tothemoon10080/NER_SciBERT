As high-grade and easily exploitable copper ores have been getting depleted, the development of flotation techniques for copper ores with low-grade and small grain size is becoming an important issue. To process these kinds of ores, fine grinding is essential to achieve sufficient liberation; however, flotation rate of finely ground minerals (<5 µm) is substantially low due to the low collision probability between air bubbles and mineral particles. Agglomeration-flotation using surfactant-stabilized oil emulsions was effective to improve the recovery of finely ground chalcopyrite. In this study, the effects of emulsifiers in the presence of co-existing minerals and ions on agglomeration-flotation of finely ground chalcopyrite were investigated.
                  The addition of anionic emulsifiers (SDS, KAX) could stabilize the oil–water emulsion and produce smaller oil droplets, which improve Cu recovery in the agglomeration-flotation of chalcopyrite and quartz from ~68% (without emulsifier) to >97% (with emulsifier). When Ca2+ and quartz co-existed, the amounts of SDS used as emulsifier were reduced due to its adsorption onto the surface of Ca2+ activated quartz, which caused the coalescence of oil droplets resulting in low Cu recovery (i.e., 81% with quartz only; 44% with quartz and Ca2+). Meanwhile, emulsified oil stabilized by KAX was not affected by the presence of Ca2+ and quartz, and high Cu recovery (~83%) could be obtained.
