Plants require essentially the same set of elements for normal growth, acquired mainly as ions from the soil environment. Yet soils vary widely in their capacity to supply these ions due to large variations in soil development and inherent heterogeneity within the soil system. Roots predominantly access nutrients from the soil solution phase but concentrations are low, thus replenishment from the solid and, depending on the nutrient, the gaseous phase, is important. Roots and ions must also come into contact so that uptake can occur, and the responses of roots and the movement of ions will be discussed.
