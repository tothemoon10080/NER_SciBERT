Aniline is a priority pollutant that is unfavorable to the environment and human health due to its carcinogenic and mutagenic nature. The performance of the dielectric barrier discharge reactor was examined based on the aniline degradation efficiency. Different parameters were studied and optimized to treat various wastewater conditions. Role of active species for aniline degradation was investigated by the addition of inhibitors and promoters. The optimum conditions were 20 mg/L initial concentration, 1.8 kV applied voltage, 4 L/min gas flow rate and a pH of 8.82. It was observed that 87% of aniline was degraded in 60 min of dielectric barrier discharge treatment at optimum conditions. UV–Vis spectra showed gradual increase in the treatment efficiency of aniline with the propagation of treatment time. Mineralization of AN was confirmed by TOC measurement and a decrease in pH during the process. To elicit the aniline degradation route, HPLC and LC-MS techniques were used to detect the intermediates and byproducts. It was identified that aniline degraded into different organic byproducts and was dissociated into carbon dioxide and water. Comparison of the current system with existing advanced oxidation processes showed that DBD has a remarkable potential for the elimination of organic pollutants.
