The method of singular coefficient of water inrush to achieve safety mining has limitation and one sidedness. Aiming at the problem above, large amounts of data about water inrush were collected. Then the data, including the maximum water inrush, water inrush coefficient and water abundance in aquifers of working face, were processed by the statistical analysis. The analysis results indicate that both water inrush coefficient and water abundance in aquifers should be taken into consideration when evaluating the danger of water inrush from coal seam floor. The prediction model of safe-mining evaluation grade was built by using the support vector machine, and the result shows that this model has high classification accuracy. A feasible classification system of water-inrush safety evaluation can be got by using the data visualization method which makes the implicit support vector machine models explicit.
