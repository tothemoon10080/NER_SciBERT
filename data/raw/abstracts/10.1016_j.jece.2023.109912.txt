Xanthate is widely used in the flotation process of sulfide ores, and large amount of flotation wastewater with xanthate is produced and caused serious wastewater pollution due to its excessive usage. This study intensively studied ozonation and various ozone based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for alkyl xanthates (AXs) degradation and mineralization, including catalytic ozonation, peroxone and photocatalytic ozonation. The key operation parameters, such as ozone dosage, ratio of different oxidants and solution were studied. All integrated ozonation processes improved the mineralization efficiency of AXs, among which TiO2 photocatalytic ozonation is the most efficient, and the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate can reach 84.9% in 60Â min. A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model was also established for ozonation of xanthates for the first time, based on quantum chemical calculation of series of xanthate structures and their degradation rate constants in ozonation. It reveals that the main factor affecting the ozonation rate constant is the molecular volume, which is negatively linearly correlated with the length of carbon chain of alkyl substituent group. The degradation intermediates of potassium amyl xanthate were measured by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), based on which a degradation path of xanthate was proposed. This work provides deeper understanding of advanced oxidation and mineralization of AXs, and may guide the development of treating technology for flotation wastewater.
