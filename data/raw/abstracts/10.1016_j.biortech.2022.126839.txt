This study compared effects of clay minerals before and after firing in immobilization of organic nitrogen and reducing of nitrogen loss during chicken manure composting. The clay minerals and fired clay minerals treatments increased organic nitrogen contents and significantly reduced nitrogen loss, the loss was in order CK (52.61%) > M (47.15%) > I (45.90%) > M- (42.58%) > I- (40.59%). Meanwhile, network analysis indicated that core bacterial community associated with nitrogen transformation were more abundant, and conversion effect of single core bacteria on nitrogen components was enhanced in fired clay minerals treatments. In addition, fired clay minerals strengthened correlation between environmental factors, bacterial community and organic nitrogen, and enhanced interaction of abiotic and biotic pathways, which verified by variance partitioning analysis and structural equation model. Therefore, fired clay minerals play a remarkable driving role in formation and immobilization of organic nitrogen.
