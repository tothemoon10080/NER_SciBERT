Objectives
                  The lack of standardized X-ray imaging remains a challenge for comparative studies on spatial scans acquired from different clinic-specific X-ray scanners. The central objectives of this study are: 1) to delineate mineral density (MD) values, and 2) generate spatial MD maps of various physiologic and pathologic biominerals, and 3) propose a standardization protocol within the safe-operating zone of a CT scanner that underpins normalization of absorbed dose to shape and density of tissues.
               
                  Methods
                  A systematic approach to propose a standardization protocol for CT imaging in vivo included: 1) estimation of pathologic MD ranges by performing a comparative meta-analysis on 2009–2019 data from the PubMed database; 2) calibration of cone-beam CT (CBCT) and micro-CT scanners with phantoms of known mineral densities (0, 250, 500, 750 and 3000 mg/cc) and shapes (cylinders and polyhedrons); 3) scanning craniofacial bones (N = 5) and dental tissues (N = 5), and ectopic minerals from humans (N = 3 each, pulp, salivary gland, kidney and prostrate stones, and penile and vascular plaques); 4) underscoring the effect of shape-factor (surface area-to-volume ratio) on MD of biominerals.
               
                  Results
                  Higher MDs of physiologic and pathologic cortical bones (504–1009 mg/cc) compared to trabecular bone (82–212 mg/cc) were observed. An increase in shape-factor increased the CBCT error in MD measurement and revealed that the scanner resolution is dependent on the absorbed dose and shape-factor of detectable features.
               
                  Significance
                  CT scanners should be calibrated with phantoms containing segments of known shape-factors and mineral densities to identify safe-operating zones. The calibrated approach will narrow the gap between length-scale dependent measurements, and will permit spatiotemporal quantitative and reliable detection of pathologies.
