To develop bone implants, a novel tissue-engineered bone was constructed via templated human bone mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) mineralization. Firstly, an osteoid-like template (Os-template) with aligned collagen fibers was prepared and followed by seeding hBMSCs to mimic the process of bone formation. After being cultured over weeks, the cells produced collagen fibers in an orderly aligned osteomorphic fashion. Further, a novel tissue-engineered bone with mineralized collagen fiber (mOs-ECM) was subsequently achieved after cell mineralization, showing a high degree of osteomimicry in terms of both composition and structure. When applied to the rat cranial bone defect model, the mOs-ECM significantly promoted the new bone formation and fused with the host bone. The study indicated that microscopic cell mineralization could be guided by artificially designed templates and successfully fabricated a macroscopic implant with a pronounced effect on bone repairing.
