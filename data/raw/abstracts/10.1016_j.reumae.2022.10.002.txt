Introduction and aim
                  
                     T-score bone mineral density (BMD) thresholds may influence guidance for treatment in patients under glucocorticoid (GC) therapy. Different BMD thresholds have been described but there is no international consensus. The aim of this study was to find a threshold to help in treatment decision-making in the population under GC therapy.
               
                  Methods
                  A working group representing three scientific societies from Argentina was convened. The first team was formed by specialists with expertise in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) who voted according to summary of evidence. The second team was constituted by a methodology group who coordinated and supervised each stage. We conducted two systematic reviews to synthesize the evidence. The first included trials of drugs used in GIO to analyze the BMD cut-off used as inclusion criteria. In the second, we analyzed the evidence regarding the densitometric thresholds to discriminate between fractured and non-fractured patients under GC treatment.
               
                  Results
                  In the first review, 31 articles were included for qualitative synthesis and more than 90% of the trials included patients regardless of their densitometric T-score or range of osteopenia. In the second review, 4 articles were included and more than 80% of the T-scores were in the range −1.6 to −2.0. The summary of findings was analyzed and put to a vote.
               
                  Conclusions
                  With more than 80% agreement of the voting expert panel, a T-score≤−1.7 was considered the most appropriate for treatment in postmenopausal women and men over 50 years of age under GC therapy. This study could help in treatment decision-making in patients under GC therapy without fractures but other fracture risk factors should certainly be considered.
