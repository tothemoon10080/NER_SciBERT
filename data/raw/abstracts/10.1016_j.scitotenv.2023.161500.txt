Highly stabilized digestate from sewage sludge and digestate-derived ammonium sulphate (RFs), were used in a comparison with synthetic mineral fertilizers (SF) to crop maize in a three-year plot trial in open fields. RFs and SF were dosed to ensure the same amount of mineral N (ammonia-N). In doing so, plots fertilized with digestate received much more N (+185 kg ha−1 of organic N) because digestate also contained organic N. The fate of nitrogen was studied by measuring mineral and organic N in soil at different depths, ammonia and N2O emissions, and N uptake in crops. Soil analyses indicated that at one-meter depth there was no significant difference in nitrate content between RF, SF and Unfertilized plots during crop season indicating that more N dosed with digestate did not lead to extra nitrate leaching. Ammonia emissions and N content in plants and grains measured were also similar for both RF and SF. Measuring denitrification activity by using gene makers resulted in a higher denitrification activity for RF than SF. Nevertheless, N2O measurements showed that SF emitted more N2O than RF (although it was not statistically different) (7.59 ± 3.2 kgN ha−1 for RF and 10.3 ± 6.8 kgN ha−1 for SF), suggesting that probably the addition of organic matter with digestate to RF, increased the denitrification efficiency so that N2 production was favoured. Soil analyses, although were not able detecting N differences between SF and Rf after three years of cropping, revealed a statistical increasing of total carbon, suggesting that dosing digestate lead to carbon (and maybe N) accumulation in soil. Data seem to suggest that N2O/N2 emission and organic N accumulation in soil can explain the fate of the extra N dosed (organic-N) in RF plots.
