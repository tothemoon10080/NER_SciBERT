Fundamental mechanical and creep behavior of minerals at elevated temperatures is relevant to many subsurface exploration and resource recovery processes, yet remains largely elusive. This study uses instrumented indentation to measure microscale deformation and nanoscale creep of biotite, albite, and quartz, which are the major mineral phases of granitic rocks, at temperatures up to 400 °C. The results show that the elastic modulus of biotite is not only the lowest at room temperature but also decays the most at elevated temperature (i.e., by 25% reduction at 400 °C) compared to that of albite and quartz. The creep deformation within 20 s doubles when the temperature increases from 20 °C to 400 °C for albite, quartz, and biotite, and biotite showed at least three times the overall creep deformation compared to quartz and albite under the same temperature. The indentation creep deformation can be well characterized using a logarithmic time model, showing both transient and constant-rate creep deformation. The secondary creep rate for biotite is about three times that of albite and quartz at the same temperature, and as the temperature increases from 20 °C to 400 °C, the rate of secondary creep becomes approximately 10 times faster for the three tested minerals. Both transient creep deformation and the rate of secondary creep can be empirically correlated to the elastic moduli, which allows quick estimates of the temperature-dependent creep behavior of granitic minerals using their elastic properties, especially when those creep constants are not readily available at elevated temperatures. These results enhance the understanding of temperature-dependent creep deformation at small scales and provide insight into mineral-level damage in granitic rocks due to temperature and long-term deformation.
