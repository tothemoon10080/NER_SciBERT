In mineral potential mapping, supervised machine learning algorithms have shown great promise in delineating and prioritizing potential areas. However, since mineralization being a relatively rare geological event, most supervised machine learning-based models face substantial challenges in properly identifying prospective areas. Data sets with strongly imbalanced distributions of the target variable (deposits) and insufficient training data sets impose obstacles to these kinds of models which can significantly impact adversely on the performance of the models. Moreover, in some cases, negative training data sets as the non-deposit locations aren't really true negative data, which cause higher uncertainty in a mineral potential map. In this study, for handling these challenges the deep autoencoder neural network is adopted. The autoencoder can be trained to reconstruct geospatial data set in totally unsupervised manner and identify prospective areas based on the reconstruction error, where higher error corresponds with areas of higher mineral potential. In order to confirm the efficiency of the autoencoder algorithm in mineral potential modeling, the model was compared with a popular data-driven approach that assigned a weight to the evidence layer by using a concentration-area (C-A) fractal model and a prediction-area (P-A) plot, and combined them using a multi-class index overlay method. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, success-rate curve, and P-A plot were adopted to evaluate the predictive ability of Fe prospectivity models pertaining to the Esfordi district of Iran. Also, we use an area under the ROC curve (AUC) and partial AUC (pAUC) to quantitatively evaluate the overall and sensitivity performance of models, respectively.
