The present work focused on understanding the interaction between clay minerals with alkaline fluids used in the oil industry. For this, a comparative study was conducted where the reaction of three rocks belonging to the Eocene Esmeraldas Formation was observed under two experiments. One of these tests consisted of a hydrothermal treatment at static conditions solutions with different concentrations of sodium hydroxide at different interaction times and constant temperature. In parallel, core-flooding tests were carried out, where the original conditions to which these rocks are subjected in the well were considered. Both the original and treated samples were examined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and the standard test method for Methylene Blue Index to determine the changes that these minerals underwent upon contact with high pH alkaline fluids. As a result, zeolite Linde Type A (LTA), sodalite (SOD) and cancrinite (CAN) formed after alkaline hydrothermal treatment under static conditions, which coincided with the dissolution of kaolinite and smectite. In contrast, core-flooding tests did not show the appearance of zeolites; but dissolution of smectite and kaolinite was observed, in addition to the appearance of an unidentified crystalline phase. The concentration of the alkaline solution and reaction time influenced the dissolution of clays. On the other hand, the cation exchange capacity (CEC) increased at lower concentrations and short reaction times in hydrothermal treatments, which is explained by the appearance of zeolite LTA. Core-flooding tests did not yield the same results as alkaline hydrothermal treatments. It is due to the continuous flow of the alkaline solution through the core plugs that did not allow the polymerization of dissolved aluminosilicate material.
