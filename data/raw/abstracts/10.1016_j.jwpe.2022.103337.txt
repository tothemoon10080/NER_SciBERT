The biotransformation of the SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs, ribavirin and tenofovir, was studied in methanogenic bioreactors. The role of iron-rich minerals, recovered from a metallurgic effluent, on the biotransformation process was also assessed. Enrichment of anaerobic sludge with recovered minerals promoted superior removal efficiency for both antivirals (97.4 % and 94.7 % for ribavirin and tenofovir, respectively) as compared to the control bioreactor lacking minerals, which achieved 58.5 % and 37.9 % removal for the same drugs, respectively. Further analysis conducted by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy revealed several metabolites derived from the biotransformation of both antivirals. Interestingly, tracer analysis with 13CH4 revealed that anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to Fe(III) reduction occurred in the enriched bioreactor, which was reflected in a lower content of methane in the biogas produced from this system, as compared to the control bioreactor. This treatment proposal is suitable within the circular economy concept, in which recovered metals from an industrial wastewater are applied in bioreactors to create a biocatalyst for promoting the biotransformation of emerging pollutants. This strategy may be appropriate for the anaerobic treatment of wastewaters originated from hospitals, as well as from the pharmaceutical and chemical sectors.
