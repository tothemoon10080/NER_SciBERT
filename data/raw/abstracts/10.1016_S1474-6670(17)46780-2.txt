Inspired by a recent review article on the Automation of the Mining, Mineral, and Metal Processing Industry (MMM), this paper will discuss some important ”patches” of computer aided measurement processes in the MMM processing industries. Both evaluation of measurement data, as well as real-time control of the measurement processes will be covered. Notes will be given on the use of machine vision, electrochemical potential, optical emission spectrometry, and X-ray spectrometry. Some visions for the future will be offered.
