Geologic mapping at the Pueblo Viejo Au–Ag–Cu-(Zn) mine, Dominican Republic, and across the surrounding Pueblo Viejo district, reveals the geologic setting at the time of mineralization. Ore deposits consisting of disseminated sulfide, bedded massive sulfide, and high-grade massive sulfide veins formed (∼112 Ma) in a volcanic dome field during a period of extension across an emergent, intraoceanic island arc. Geologic maps reveal the links between volcanic domes and structure, hydrothermal alteration and mineralization, and ore deposits and gossans. Whole-rock geochemical data establish a tholeiitic signature for Early Cretaceous magmatism including the volcanic dome field. Northerly-striking, high-angle faults controlled the emplacement of volcanic domes and served as feeders for hydrothermal solutions. The largest ore deposits formed in a subsiding, marginal marine, volcano-sedimentary basin. Stacked intervals of bedded massive sulfide mineralization indicate that the basin was subsiding while mineralization was underway. Calc-alkaline dikes and plutons in the Pueblo Viejo district intruded at ∼88 Ma, well after mineralization had ended. Low-angle reverse faulting, greenschist facies metamorphism, and milky quartz veining and replacement were also Late Cretaceous (post-mineral) events. Ore deposits in the Pueblo Viejo district are best described as hybrid epithermal – VMS deposits, formed during a period of Early Cretaceous extension, tholeiitic volcanism, and volcanic dome emplacement in a shallow, marginal marine environment. Exploration for Au–Ag–Cu-(Zn) deposits like Pueblo Viejo should focus on intraoceanic island arcs, tholeiitic volcanic dome fields, extensional volcano-sedimentary basins, and VMS mineral occurrences.
