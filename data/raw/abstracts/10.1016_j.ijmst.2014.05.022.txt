In order to utilize low-grade manganese ore resources effectively, a hydrometallurgical process was developed for manganese extraction in dilute sulfuric acid medium, and the kinetics of leaching manganese was also investigated. At room temperature, manganese from low-grade manganese carbonate ores was extracted by sulfuric acid leaching without reductants. During the extracting process, single-factor analysis method was used to evaluate the effects of grinding fineness, sulfuric acid concentration, liquid-to-solid ratio, agitation rate and leaching time on the leaching efficiencies of Mn and Fe. The optimal leaching conditions are determined as coarse particles of below 2mm size (without ball-milling), sulfuric acid concentration of 0.86mol/L, liquid-to-solid ratio of 5:1, agitation rate of 150r/min and leaching for 180min at room temperature. Under the optimal conditions, the leaching efficiencies of Mn and Fe are 96.21% and 13.35%, respectively. In addition, through the experiments at different temperatures, it is found that the leaching process follows the shrinking core model under the conditions of changing acid concentration and intermittent reaction device. Moreover, the apparent activations of effective diffusion and chemical reaction in the kinetic model are calculated to be 18.83 and 27.15kJ/mol, respectively.
