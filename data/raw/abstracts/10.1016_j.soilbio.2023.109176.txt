Inorganic nitrogen (N) is the most important nutrient in soils, because it limits plant productivity and affects ecosystem function. It is produced by the mineralization of organic N to ammonium (NH4

The relative importance of the explanatory variables for inorganic N production suggested that the soil calcium concentration was the predominant determinant of the rates of M
