Mono-functional chelating collectors exhibit limited selectivity in the flotation of minerals. In particular, the selective separation of calcium minerals presents a significant challenge because mono-functional chelating collectors, such as fatty acid, indistinguishably adsorb onto mineral surfaces by coordinating with the same metal cation (Ca2+). Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new-mode-functional collectors to separate calcium minerals and a need to understand the underlying chemoselectivity. Given the difference of the hydrogen bonding ability of anions with fluorite, calcite and scheelite surfaces, the introduction of additional hydrogen bonding functional groups into collector molecules is a novel strategy to improve selectivity. In this study, a hydrogen and coordination bonding (bi-functional) collector, 2-cyano-N-ethylcarbamoyl acetamide (CEA) was developed, which could form coordination bonds with the Ca2+ ions (by carbonyl groups) and hydrogen bonds with the anions (by amino groups) on calcium mineral surfaces. The results of flotation tests showed that CEA can selectively separate fluorite and calcite from scheelite at pH 7. The promising selectivity of CEA lies in both the electrical properties and the anions’ hydrogen bonding ability with the three calcium minerals. The negatively charged scheelite surfaces are not conducive to coordination bonding with CEA while the positively charged fluorite and calcite surfaces are. Besides, the hydrogen bonding ability of fluorite (F−) and calcite (CO3
                     2−) with carbamido in CEA is higher than that of scheelite (WO4
                     2−), and this also plays an essential role. This coordination and hydrogen bonding based surfactant design protocol has a great potential in the development of tail-made collectors/depressants for the separation of other oxidized minerals.
