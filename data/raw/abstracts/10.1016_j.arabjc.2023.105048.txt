In this study, the degradation of salicylhydroxamic acid (SHA) in industrial beneficiation wastewater was investigated using dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) and La-Fe3O4-doped activated carbon (La-Fe3O4/AC). The physical and chemical properties of La-Fe3O4/AC were studied using several characterization techniques including scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The response surface methodology was used to optimize three critical experimental parameters of the catalyst: its dosage and the mass ratios of La and Fe3O4. These parameters contributed to the SHA degradation in the following decreasing order: mass ratio of La > catalyst dosage > mass ratio of Fe3O4. The SHA degradation efficiency reached 98.6%, and the synergistic factor was 2.83 at a peak-to-peak discharge voltage of 23 kV. The results showed that the DBD-La-Fe3O4/AC system improved the SHA degradation efficiency and exhibited a significant synergistic effect. Pb2+ and Cu2+ slightly increased the SHA degradation efficiency. Quenching experiments on activated substances confirmed that •OH and 
                        
                     O2
                     – were crucial to the degradation of SHA. The O3 and H2O2 generated by the DBD-catalyst system were absorbed by the La-Fe3O4/AC catalyst to produce more •OH. Ten main intermediates were detected in the degradation process of the DBD-catalyst system using HPLC-MS, and three degradation procedures were proposed.
