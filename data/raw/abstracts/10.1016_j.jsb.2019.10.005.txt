Unicellular protists can biomineralize spatially complex and functional shells. A typical cell of the photosynthetic synurophyte Mallomonas is covered by about 60–100 silica scales. Their geometric arrangement, the so-called scale case, mainly depends on the species and on the cell cycle. In this study, the scale case of the synurophyte Mallomonas was preserved in aqueous suspension using high-pressure freezing (HPF). From this specimen, a three-dimensional (3D) data set spanning a volume of about 25.6 μm × 19.2 μm × 4.2 μm with a voxel size of 12.5 nm × 12.5 nm × 25.0 nm was collected by Cryo-FIB SEM in 3 h and 24 min. SEM imaging using In-lens SE detection allowed to clearly differentiate between mineralized, curved scales of less than 0.2 μm thickness and organic cellular ultrastructure or vitrified ice. The three-dimensional spatial orientations and shapes of a minimum set of scales (N = 13) were identified by visual inspection, and manually segmented. Manual and automated segmentation approaches were comparatively applied to one arbitrarily selected reference scale using the differences in grey level between scales and other constituents. Computational automated routines and principal component analysis of the experimentally extracted data created a realistic mathematical model based on the Fibonacci pattern theory. A complete in silico scale case of Mallomonas was reconstructed showing an optimized scale coverage on the cell surface, similarly as it was observed experimentally. The minimum time requirements from harvesting the living cells to the final scale case determination by Cryo-FIB SEM and computational image processing are discussed.
