In order to understand flotation performance in industrial-scale, it is of relevance to understand the surface properties and mineral species of materials contained in the various parts of the cell. In this work XRPD X-Ray Powder Diffraction) and DVS (Dynamic Vapor Sorption) were used to characterise the different minerals and the wettability of the sample collected at different depths in an industrial scale flotation cell.
                  DVS is a novel technique for wettability measurement in mineral processing, of higher robustness and reproducibility compared to the Washburn technique.
                  In the turbulent zone of the cell, the wettability properties are relatively similar, and decreases in the froth and concentrate. Differences in radial position were only found near the froth phase close to the shaft of the agitator.
                  The main finding was that wettability information obtained by DVS could be correlated with mineral composition and particle size distribution.
