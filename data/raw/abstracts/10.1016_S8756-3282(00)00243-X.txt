The distribution of matrix vesicles and its role in biological mineralization were examined in bone and dental hard tissues of the rat after daily administrations of 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate (HEBP), a potent inhibitor of mineralization, for 7 or 14 days. Newly formed, nonmineralized matrices of the HEBP-affected bone and mesodermal dental hard tissues other than circumpulpal dentin contained numerous mineral-filled matrix vesicles (MV), randomly distributed throughout the collagenous matrix. The distribution density of the mineral-filled MV in the HEBP-affected matrices of calvaria, metaphyseal trabecular bone, alveolar bone, and cellular cementum ranged from 60 to 70 per 100 μm2, and no statistically significant differences were noted among the values. In the HEBP-affected dentin, however, MV were located only in the nonmineralized matrix of mantle dentin and totally absent in the circumpulpal dentin layers. Instead, the HEBP-affected circumpulpal dentin contained a dense meshwork of noncollagenous matrix enriched with calcium and phosphorus. Comparable meshwork structures were undetectable in nonmineralized matrices of the other hard tissues affected by HEBP. These observations suggest that a certain population of MV (60–70 per 100 μm2) is involved in the process of appositional mineralization in most of the mesodermal hard tissues, in addition to their well-known role in initial mineral induction in these tissues. Circumpulpal dentin appears to be an exception, where MV are not required for the appositional mineralization process. Exclusive localization of dentin phosphoproteins in circumpulpal dentin layers must take place to facilitate appositional mineralization at the calcification front, in the absence of MV.
