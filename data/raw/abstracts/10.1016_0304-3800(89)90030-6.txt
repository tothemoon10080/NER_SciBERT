The analytical model presented in the paper describes the processing of mineralization and accumulation of organic remains coming to the soil from two sources: the litterfall on the soil surface, and the dying underground parts of the plants. The concept of the model is based on the function of the intensity of mineralization of organic remains, or humus, A(t) describing the ratio of the loss of humus mass in a time unit to the amount of mass from which it was lost.
