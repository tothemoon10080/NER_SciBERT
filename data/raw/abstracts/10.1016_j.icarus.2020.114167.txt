Molecular structures and chemical compositions of organic matter in primitive meteorites reflect the conditions of the parent bodies, as well as the preaccretional history. During the parent body processing, co-existing minerals could have effects on structural changes of organics, in addition to temperature and redox state. Here, we performed heating experiments of a primordial organic matter analog with and without minerals to understand the effects of minerals on organic matter in conditions simulating metamorphism in thermally metamorphosed type 3 chondrites. The primordial analog materials were heated up to 400 °C, and the experimental products were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Montmorillonite and olivine, particularly montmorillonite, enhanced decomposition of oxygen containing species due to decarboxylation and/or cracking, while olivine enhanced esterification at lower temperature. Our results further imply that the variations of insoluble organic matter in CV, CO, and type 3 ordinary chondrites could be partially due to different mineral compositions. We also tested the effects of pressure on the degradation of the organic matter at 400 °C up to 268 atm, however no significant pressure effects were observed by FTIR and GC/MS.
