The aim of this work is in development of method for efficient well positioning and management of their operation during uranium extraction with In-Situ Leaching (ISL), to determine productive pattern of well network. ISL is a technique for mineral production in permeable medium that involves construction of injection and production well networks through which leaching solution, such as sulfuric acid, is pumped into and out of the stratum to dissolve and produce solid mineral. The process is controlled by managing flow rates and concentration of leaching solution that is injected and subsequently produced through well filters. Therefore, production effectiveness relies on: optimally selected modes of operation of selected well network, including flow rates and well location; as well as on existing natural factors such as stratum filtration properties, mineralization geometry and concentration. During the ISL process some parts of mineralization can be unoxidized by leaching solution due to ineffective operation or the specific geometry of permeability and mineralization, thereby leading to so called stagnant zones and/or spreading of the solution outside operation block. Optimal well locations for efficient deposit development are determined by accounting for balance zones (i.e. zones profitable for exploitation), results of hydrodynamic and reactive transport simulation, as well as economic evaluation.
