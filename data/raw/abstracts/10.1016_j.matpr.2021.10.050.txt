Efforts are being made by several researchers and concrete technologists towards sustainability of concrete. Researchers are working on the replacement of ordinary Portland cement either partly or fully by using mineral admixtures. Geopolymer concrete has been a relatively new development which is becoming popular over the last decade. It is prepared with mineral admixtures, coarse and fine aggregates and certain chemicals so as to undergo polymerization. In the present experimental investigation, the main aim is to develop a more efficient and stronger fiber reinforced geopolymer concrete using several mineral admixtures and fibers so as to recommend it for structural applications. Fiber reinforced geopolymer concrete mixes were produced by employing metallic fibres like steel and non-metallic fibers like glass. Four types of mineral admixtures like fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag, condensed silica fume, and metakaolin were mixed in several percentages to serve as the binder. Solidum hydroxide with the required molarity and sodium silicate were used as alkaline liquids for polymerization. Various combinations of fibrous geopolymer concrete mixes by incorporating steel and glass fibers were prepared separately. Specimens were prepared for all the mixes and tested after 28Â days of ambient curing for mechanical properties like compression, split tension & flexure. Tests for mechanical properties were conducted on hardened specimens and conclusions are drawn on optimum combinations. From the test results it can be concluded that by reinforcing GPC with fibers strength properties and other benefits can be achieved. The results indicate that fiber reinforced geopolymer concrete may be used for structural applications.
