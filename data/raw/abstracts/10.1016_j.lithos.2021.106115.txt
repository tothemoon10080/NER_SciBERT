The Ningi-Burra Pb−Zn mineralization forms part of the Nigerian Sn-Nb ± (Pb-Zn-Mo)-rich anorogenic alkaline province, also known as the Nigerian Younger Granite Complexes. Six distinct E-W trending magmatic centres have been identified in the Ningi-Burra complex, but the Pb−Zn mineralization is confined to highly evolved biotite granite in Koluki (centre 6). In this paper, a combination of geochronological and geochemical data of magmatic and hydrothermally-altered zircon from the Ningi-Burra complex are used to constrain magmatic and hydrothermal processes that facilitated the formation of Pb−Zn mineralization. Zircon trace element and Hf isotopes (εHf(t) = −5.3 to −10.3) indicate that the parental magma of these ore-bearing granites were largely derived from lower crustal sources with contributions from the upper mantle. The hydrothermal alteration that accompanied the Pb−Zn mineralization include silicification, chloritization and limited sodic metasomatism. Zircon U/Pb dating reveal that magma emplacement and subsequent hydrothermal process in Ningi-Burra complex occurred at (~192 Ma) and (<191 Ma), respectively. Zircon grains from unmineralized and hydrothermally altered rock suites have similar 176Hf/177Hf but distinct 176Lu/177Hf and 176Yb/177Hf ratios which suggest a magmatic source for the hydrothermal fluids responsible for the formation of the mineralization. This study highlights the application of zircon trace element and U-Th-Hf isotopes as robust tools for constraining magmatic and mineralization process that facilitate the formation of economically significant mineralization in highly differentiated granites.
