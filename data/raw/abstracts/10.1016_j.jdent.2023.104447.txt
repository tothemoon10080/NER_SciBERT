Objectives
                  Bioactive materials have been used for functionalization of adhesives to promote dentin remineralization. This study aims to evaluate bonding ability and both mechanical and chemical behavior of demineralized dentin infiltrated with polymeric nanoparticles doped with dexamethasone (Dex-NPs).
               
                  Methods
                  Dentin conditioned surfaces were infiltrated with NPs, Dex-NPs or Dex-Zn-NPs. Bonded interfaces were also created and stored for 24Â h or 21d, and then submitted to microtensile bond strength testing. Dentin remineralization was analyzed by Nanohardness, Young's modulus and Raman analysis.
               
                  Results
                  At 21d of storage, dentin treated with undoped-NPs attained the lowest nanohardness and Young's modulus. Dex-NPs and Zn-Dex-NPs increased dentin nanohardness and Young's modulus after 21d Raman analysis showed high remineralization, crystallinity, crosslinking and better structure of collagen when functionalized Dex-NPs were present at the dentin interface.
               
                  Conclusions
                  Infiltration of dentin with Dex-NPs promoted functional remineralization as proved by nanomechanical and morpho-chemical evaluation tests. Dexamethasone in dentin facilitated crystallographic maturity, crystallinity and improved maturity and secondary structure of dentin collagen.
               
                  Clinical significance
                  Using dexamethasone-functionalized NPs before resin infiltration is a clear option to obtain dentin remineralization, as these NPs produce the reinforcement of the dentin structure, which will lead to the improvement of the longevity of resin restorations.
