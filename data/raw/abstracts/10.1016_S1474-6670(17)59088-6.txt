A method is presented in this paper which produces dynamic suboptimal transitions to optimal equilibrium operation of plants. The control strategy developed should be especially suitable for roost mineral processing plants in which an operation close to equilibrium in sought in the presence of large uncertainty in their models. A simple linear model is identified around the present plant operating conditions. The corresponding optimal control problem is then determined using this model. As this optimal control is applied, plant operating conditions change, so that new linear model parameters are identified and a new optimal control is applied. The sequence of optimal control segments whith respect to the approximating modelthus generated, produces a suboptimal control to achieve equilibrium. The controls depend on the model parameters, so that they are easily determined each time the approximating model is updated. As an example, the method is applied to the suboptimal dynamic control of a model of an industrial mineral grinding plant.
