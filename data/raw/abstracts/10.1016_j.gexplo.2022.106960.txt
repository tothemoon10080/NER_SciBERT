This work focuses on the comparative analysis of the influence of two termites of the Macrotermes (fungus-growing) and Cubitermes (soil-feeding termites) genera on the dynamics of soil lithogeochemical facies. The aim was to establish a general systematic recognition of the lithology of a large area, including its potential for Cu and Co mineralization. Eighty-eight samples of the mound material were collected from termite mounds of these two species along a 50Â km transect in Lualaba Province, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in order to carry out major and trace element analyses. Interpretation of the data was carried out through exploratory analysis, using the Ascending Hierarchical Classification (AHC) method and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), followed by statistical modeling using linear regression. After clustering the termite mounds into classes by AHC, an initial PCA was used to map the lithology of these classes using major elements. The results highlight the dependance of the lithological composition of the mounds on the behavior specific to each of the two termite species. Linear regression modeling allowed a delineation of the area of supply of building materials for each species, indicating the possible incorporation of Cu and Co mineralizations likely to be present in the environment of the termite mounds. The use of termite mounds as a tool in mining exploration is discussed.
