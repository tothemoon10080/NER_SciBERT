Targeted Selective Treatment (TST) is a gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) control strategy where anthelmintic treatment decisions are made at an individual animal level. TST has been proven to reduce anthelmintic use and subsequently slow down anthelmintic resistance development, however questions remain regarding optimal TST methods and their applicability across farms.
                  In this study, the influence of Mineral and Vitamin (MV) supplementation on optimal energy utilisation (EU) TST thresholds was assessed on three Welsh farms. In total, 360 lambs were split into two groups, MV supplemented and control, and were treated with an anthelmintic against GIN at the midway point of the experiment. Lambs that improved their EU efficiency post treatment were deemed to have benefited from anthelmintic treatment. Optimal EU TST thresholds was determined for each treatment group per farm using Youdenâ€™s J statistic where the treatment threshold retrospectively exhibiting the greatest combined sensitivity and specificity in correctly identifying lambs benefiting from treatment was deemed to be optimal.
                  Results demonstrated that the optimal EU TST threshold was higher in MV supplemented groups at 0.72, 0.71 and 0.56 versus 0.58, 0.67, 0.51 for control groups on each respective farm. Identification of lambs for TST was more effective when using an optimised EU TST threshold, compared to when using the standard EU TST threshold of 0.66.
                  The study highlights that applying standard EU TST thresholds may not be appropriate on all commercial farms with factors including MV status as noted in this study likely to influence optimal EU TST thresholds. Additional refinement of TST systems can further strengthen their applicability across sheep flocks.
