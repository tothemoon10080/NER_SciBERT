Mineral processing operations present many challenges to process control due to variations in unmeasured ore properties, material transport delays, and nonlinear response characteristics. The conventional control approach relies mainly on the proportional-integral-derivative controllers or rule-based strategy for process control, which inherently does not have the capability to efficiently control these issues. This paper describes the application of an adaptive model-based predictive controller, BrainWave, in different mineral processing operations. This predictive controller enables significant performance improvements compared to conventional control strategies for processes with long-time delays and multivariable interactions. The paper also emphasizes how BrainWave provides a practical alternative to achieve a significant reduction in process variability, thus reducing operational costs, improving operability, and increasing production.
