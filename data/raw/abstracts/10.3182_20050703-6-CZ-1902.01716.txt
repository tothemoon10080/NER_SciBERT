A difficulty with constrained nonlinear control is the minimization of the cost function. With complex system representations such as fundamental models, the required optimization algorithm may be complex to implement, setting its parameters may be difficult and the calculation time may be long. To overcome these problems, an innovative optimization-free predictive control scheme is proposed. The minimization of the cost function is replaced by a simple and easy-to-compute simulation. Two mineral processing applications illustrate the very good performances of this new algorithm.
