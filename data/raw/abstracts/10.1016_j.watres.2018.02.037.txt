This study focuses on the effect of electrode materials on abatement of lindane (an organochlorine pesticide) by electrooxidation process. Comparative performances of different anodic (platinum (Pt), dimensionally stable anode (DSA) and boron-doped diamond (BDD)) and cathodic (carbon sponge (CS), carbon felt (CF) and stainless steel (SS)) materials on lindane electrooxidation and mineralization were investigated. Special attention was paid to determine the role of chlorine active species during the electrooxidation process. The results showed that better performances were obtained when using a BDD anode and CF cathode cell. The influence of the current density was assessed to optimize the oxidation of lindane and the mineralization of its aqueous solution. A quick (10 min) and complete oxidation of 10 mg L−1 lindane solution and relatively high mineralization degree (80% TOC removal) at 4 h electrolysis were achieved at 8.33 mA cm−2 current density. Lindane was quickly oxidized by in-situ generated hydroxyl radicals, (M(•OH)), formed from oxidation of water on the anode (M) surface following pseudo first-order reaction kinetics. Formation of chlorinated and hydroxylated intermediates and carboxylic acids during the treatment were identified and a plausible mineralization pathway of lindane by hydroxyl radicals was proposed.
