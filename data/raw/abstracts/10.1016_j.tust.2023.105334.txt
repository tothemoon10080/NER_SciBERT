An earth pressure balance shield machine (EPB) is prone to blockage when tunneling in strata with high clay mineral content. Engineers often improve soil fluidity and reduce soil adhesion through soil conditioning to ensure the safe and efficient tunneling of shields. This paper selected montmorillonite, kaolinite, and illite as research objects and used molecular dynamics simulation and laboratory experiments. The interfacial mechanical behavior between anionic surfactant (sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, SDBS) solution and clay minerals was simulated at the microscopic scale and the improvement mechanism of SDBS solution on clay minerals was revealed. Then, the zeta potential of clay minerals and the stirring torque of the soil under different foam injection ratios (FIR) were tested. Accordingly, the conditioning effect of the SDBS solution at the macroscopic scale can be evaluated. The results show that the electrostatic adsorption and repulsion of ions occur on the surface of clay minerals, which makes it difficult for clay particles to aggregate into clusters. The SO3H- groups of the SDBS surfactant are the key factor to change the hydrophilicity of clay minerals. When different soil samples are improved to the same state, montmorillonite requires the largest FIR due to its microstructure.
