This study discusses a method of quantifying emissions from surface coal mining that has been trialled in Australia. The method is based on direct measurement of surface emissions from uncovered coal seams in mine pits, concurrent measurement of residual gas content of blasted coal in mine pits, and measurement of pre-mining gas content of the same seam from cores retrieved from exploration boreholes drilled away from active mining. The results from one of the mines studied are presented in this paper. In this mine, the pre-mining gas content of the target seam was measured using cores from an exploration borehole away from active mining. Gas content varied from 0.7 to 0.8m3/t and gas composition varied from 16% to 21% CH4 (84â€“79% CO2). In-pit measurements included seam surface emissions and residual gas content of blasted and ripped coal. Residual gas content varied from 0.09 to 0.15m3/t, less than twofold across the mine pit. Composition of the residual gas was in general 90% CO2 and 10% CH4, with slight variation between samples. Coal seam surface emissions varied from 1.03 to 7.50mL of CO2-e per minute and per square meter of the coal seam surface, a sevenfold variation across the mine pit.
