Fresh organic carbon (C) input will accelerate or inhibit the mineralization of native soil organic carbon (SOC), which is called positive or negative priming effect (PE), respectively. However, little is known about how warming affects the PE. Here, we adopted a widely-used ratio of SOC mineralization between substrate-added and unadded-control treatments to represent PE intensity and used the PE difference between ambient-control temperature and elevated temperature to indicate the effect of warming on PE (ΔPE). By conducting a meta-analysis of 146 observations from 57 independent soils worldwide, we found that experimental warming significantly decreased the PE by 0.26 (unitless). Among ecosystems, warming significantly suppressed the PE of cropland and grassland soils by 0.43 and 0.21 respectively, but did not change the PE of forest soils. Moreover, we found significant positive correlations of ΔPE with the initial soil C/N ratio and the effect size of warming on microbial biomass. Between substrate types (i.e., containing N or not), warming significantly decreased the PE induced by N-containing substrates. These results suggested that the response of PE to warming is likely regulated by soil N availability and warming-induced changes in microbial biomass. As such, we proposed a conceptual framework—the microbial N mining hypothesis dominates in soils with low C/N ratio where warming inhibits PE by promoting N mineralization, while the stoichiometric decomposition hypothesis dominates in soils with high C/N ratio where warming stimulates PE by promoting N mineralization. Collectively, these findings provide important insights into how warming affects SOC dynamics via inhibiting PE, which may weaken the positive feedback between soil C emission and climate warming.
