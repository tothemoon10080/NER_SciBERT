The term “Mineral Resources” has changed significantly in meaning especially since the turn of the millennium. Until the mid 1990s, a resource simply implied the existence of mineralization which might become potentially economic. In more recent times, a Mineral Resource cannot be declared unless there is some justification for expecting the deposit to be profitably exploited as of the date of the study. The term “Reserve” is now applied to a resource which can be proven to be economic through the inclusion of all mining and economic parameters from access to rehabilitation. Since the economic climate is extremely variable, this discussion will concentrate on the “technical” quantification of in situ mineralization. The quantification methods discussed here relate to those parameters for which an average (or total) is a suitable estimator. However, the techniques can also be adapted for categorical variables, such as lithology. Some variables from deposits such as oil and gas, which depend on flow characteristics and connectivity, are not suitable for these techniques. A reading list is included and many informative resources are available on the internet (cf. www.kriging.com).
