Honey is a food product made by honeybees from nectar or honeydew. It has great benefits both nutritionally and therapeutically. In our study, physicochemical characteristics: moisture, ash, pH, free acidity, electrical conductivity, hydroxyl-methyl furfural, and reducing sugar were evaluated. Additionally, three macro mineral contents, such as potassium, calcium, and sodium, and other trace minerals like iron, manganese, copper, zinc, and nickel were determined. For the analysis, eight composite samples were collected from Fitche and Addis Ababa districts. The physicochemical characteristics and mineral content were found within the recommended standard ranges except hydroxylmethylfurfural exceeded the maximum limits. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) observed among the study districts for the analyzed physicochemical parameters. Apart from potassium (K) and sodium (Na), the average values of minerals were found with non-significant differences between the districts. Because this work is limited to a few districts, the authors suggest that a nationwide study with representative samples would be helpful.
