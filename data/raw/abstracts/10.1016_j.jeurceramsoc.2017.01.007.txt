The sillimanite (Al2SiO5) mineral has been sintered by conventional ceramic route and by cold sintering methods. The mineral has very poor sinterability and transformed to mullite on sintering above 1525°C. The dielectric properties of sillimanite mineral (Al2SiO5) are investigated at radio and microwave frequency ranges. The mineral sintered at 1525°C has low εr of 4.71 and tanδ of 0.002 at 1MHz and at microwave frequency εr

                     ×f=41,800GHz with τf
                     =−17ppm/°C. The sintering aid used for cold sintering Al2SiO5 is sodium chloride (NaCl). The Al2SiO5
                     NaCl composite was cold sintered at 120°C. XRD analysis of the composite revealed that there is no additional phase apart from Al2SiO5 and NaCl. The densification of the Al2SiO5
                     NaCl composite was confirmed by using microstructure analysis. The Al2SiO5
                     NaCl composite has εr of 5.37 and tanδ of 0.005 at 1MHz whereas at microwave frequency it has εr
