Because of unsustainable problems in traditional urbanization, urbanization development mode is being transformed to new urbanization that is characterized by people-oriented urbanization, ecologic civilization, and economic restructure and industry upgrade. As mineral resources abundant regions (MRARs) often face great challenges in socioeconomic development and ecological environment protection, it is particularly important for them to select the new urbanization path matching with actual situation. Therefore, this paper constructs a path matching model on new urbanization, and takes 18 provincial MRARs as examples for empirical analysis. Results show that some MRARs are matched with more than one new urbanization path; among the total 27 province-times, 16 province-times are suitable for simple type and 17 province-times are suitable for resource-based urbanization path, which shows that weak environmental carrying capacity and poor socioeconomic foundation are the obvious characteristics of MRARs in China. In simple type, the proportion of province-times suitable for comprehensive and central-city urbanization paths is 37.5%, while in intensive type, the proportion is only 18.18%. It means that some MRARs suitable for intensive type, such as Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan, do not make full use of the advantage of environmental carrying capacity. Based on the path matching results, this paper puts forward policy suggestions. The uniqueness of this paper lies in that a novel new urbanization path matching model is constructed, and this paper uses the VIKOR method to obtain the compromise solution set rather than single solution.
