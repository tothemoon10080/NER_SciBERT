Detection of the mineral constituents in a batch of 310 samples of human urinary calculi (kidney stones-235 and bladder stones-75) combined with a semi-quantitative analysis has been presented on the basis of Fourier Transform based IR and Raman spectral measurements. Some of the observed characteristic IR and Raman bands have been proposed as ‘Marker Bands’ for the most reliable identification of the constituents. A detailed vibrational spectral analysis combined with a DFT level calculation for the functional groups in Calcium Oxalate Monohydrate (COM), Magnesium Ammonium Phosphate Hexahydrate (MAPH), Calcium Hydrogen Phosphate Dihydrate (CHPD), Penta-Calcium Hydroxy-Triphosphate (PCHT) and Uric Acid (UA) has been proposed. It has been shown that the identified mineral constituents as major or minor components can be deduced from the application of Lambert-Beer law of radiation absorption and results are in agreement with quantitative Spectral Data base. This simple method has the potential to be integrated into the management of Urolithiasis, a process of forming renal calculi in the kidney, bladder and/or urethra. Employment of powder XRD, TGA, SEM, TXRF and IR Imaging techniques has provided additional support for the proposed foolproof identification of the mineral constituents. Among the mineral constituents, Calcium Oxalate Monohydrate, Calcium Oxalate Dihydrate or their mixture account for 85% of the total number of samples; the remaining 15% and 5% samples contain Phosphate and Uric acid stones respectively.
