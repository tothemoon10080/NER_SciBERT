Grouting filling materials into a goaf is a necessary step for goaf disaster prevention and control. This study is aimed at developing a process and method of rapid and low-cost CO2 mineralization with alkaline waste. The effects of various factors, including stirring speed, pressure, solid-liquid ratio and slurry entry speed, on mineralization degree and reaction heat extraction during the mineralization process in the constant-pressure and continuous-feed way were investigated through experiments and numerical simulations. Besides, costs in the whole mineralization process were analyzed. The following conclusions were drawn: The mineralization degree exceeds 80% in the constant-pressure and continuous-feed way, and the CO2 sequestration capacity of carbide slag reaches 0.47 g/g. In addition, the equation of the cost of CO2 emission reduction was established. This study offers a novel and low-cost carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technology route that can accelerate the realization of peak CO2 emissions and carbon neutrality.
