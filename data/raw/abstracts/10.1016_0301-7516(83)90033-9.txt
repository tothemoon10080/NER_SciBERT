In mineral processing and coal cleaning operations, there are two classes of unit operations used in the separation processes. The first type — crushing, grinding, pelletizing and settling — modifies the size distribution of the feed. The second type — heavy media, sizing, flotation, magnetic, electrostatic and jigging — separates the particles. In these latter unit operations, the size distribution is not changed; rather, the feed stream is split into a product and waste stream based on subtle physical and physicochemical differences between the different types of feed particles. In separation unit operations, the mathematical functions, representing the behavior of the unit operations, are easy to manipulate. Thus, a number of theorems, useful to both the plant designer, and the plant engineer, can be proven.
                  The work presented in this paper makes the fundamental assumption of linearity as do all current plant design analysis systems. The linearity assumption states that in a separation operation, there is no particle-particle interaction effecting the probability that a particle will be selected for the product or waste stream. In other words, if one doubles or triples the feed rate to a unit operation, the fraction of particles of a given characteristic selected to appear in the product stream remains unchanged. In actuality, this assumption is not true because higher feed rates affect the behavior of separation operations. However, when designing a plant, one can calculate the feed rate to a given unit operation and then select a piece of equipment large enough to handle the computed tonnage. Thus, the designed circuit behaves linearly.
