There are approximately 400 inorganic minerals in the Earth's crust, some of which can be encountered as elongate mineral particles [EMPs] with dimensional characteristics similar to the six minerals known as asbestos and other asbestiform amphiboles with established human pathogenicity. In addition, the rapidly developing field of nanotechnology is producing an ever-increasing array of high aspect ratio engineered nanomaterials [HARNs] with physical dimensions and biodurability similar to the asbestos fiber types with recognized pathogenic potential. Many of these non-asbestos/non-asbestiform EMPs and HARNs with the potential for aerosolization into the breathing zones of workers and in individuals in non-occupational environments have not yet been thoroughly studied with respect to their potential human pathogenicity, a fact which obviously poses concerns for both occupational health and public health professionals. On the basis of dose-response considerations it seems reasonable to infer that if any of these non-regulated EMPs or HARNs actually are pathogenic, then those mineral fiber exposure-induced disorders associated with the lowest cumulative exposure doses of the commercial amphibole types of asbestos, that is, diffuse mesothelioma of the pleura, and its non-malignant correlate of benign parietal pleural plaques, are those which are most likely to occur following inhalational exposures to any of the non-regulated EMPs and HARNs. Because of that observation, this paper reviews certain aspects of diffuse mesothelioma, including a summary of recent changes in the nomenclature of diffuse mesothelioma of the pleura; of both the descriptive and the analytical epidemiology of the disease; of the etiologies of mesothelioma, both “exposure” related and endogenous in nature; and of the asbestos population attributable fraction for diffuse mesotheliomas in the USA, both historically and in the future.
