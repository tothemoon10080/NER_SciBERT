The removal of pesticide residues in soil is a research hotspot. The metolachlor (MET) adsorption by walnut shell biochar (BC) modified with montmorillonite (MBC), illite (IBC), and kaolinite (KBC), as well as the original BC (OBC) was investigated. The characteristics of samples were studied by scanning electron microscopy and mapping analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry, and chemical stability analysis. The effects of the dosage, ionic strength, and pH, and determined the adsorption kinetics and isotherms for MET with the BCs were analyzed. In addition, response surface methodology regression model analysis was conducted and the adsorption mechanisms were investigated. The results showed that the thermal stability and chemical stability of MBC, IBC, and KBC were higher than those of OBC, and MBC had the greatest stability. The MET adsorption rates of OBC, MBC, IBC, and KBC were 62.15%, 92.47%, 87.97%, and 83.31%, respectively. The kinetic fitting results and adsorption mechanisms showed that the modification of BC with minerals enhanced the physical adsorption of MET. The maximum MET adsorption capacities by OBC, MBC, IBC, and KBC were 39.68 mg g−1, 68.49 mg g−1, 65.79 mg g−1, and 65.36 mg g−1, respectively. Hydrogen bonds, π–π bonds, coordination bonds, and hydrophobic interactions were the key adsorption mechanisms. Therefore, the mineral-modified BCs were characterized by high adsorption rates and stability. This approach can make BC more efficient, with higher performance as a low cost soil amendment.
