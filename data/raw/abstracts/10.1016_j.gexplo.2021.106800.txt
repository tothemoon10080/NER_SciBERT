The varying nature and thickness of glacial sediments affect the characteristics of mineralized dispersal trains in the Amaruq gold deposit area in Nunavut, northern Canada. To help evaluate the deposit signature, glacial sediments were collected from frost boils along transects parallel to the main ice-flow direction. A complementary detailed geochemical drift exploration dataset and a new Quaternary map were also used to define and interpret the geometry of the mineralized debris dispersal trains. Principal Component Analysis identifies a gold mineralization signature associating As, Ag, Au, Cu, Pb, Sb, W, S, Fe, and Zn and its mafic-BIF (Banded Iron Formation) host rock. This signature, similar to other lode gold geochemical signatures, follows a general NNW dispersal trend, in agreement with the predominant regional and local ice-flow indicators. In a zone characterized by streamlined landforms composed of thick distally -derived till, the dispersal train shows a higher distance for the first indicator to appear at surface down-ice of the known mineralization (~1 km lag) when compared to other mineralized dispersal trains (~300 m lag). Results from this area also show a lower intensity of deposit signature compared to mineralized dispersal trains located in thin locally-derived till characterized by small transverse moraine ridges. Elevated counts of scheelite and pristine-shaped gold grains are found down-ice of mineralization and their distribution is in general agreement with the dispersal train patterns defined by the till-matrix geochemistry. Our results strengthen the use of PCA and indicator minerals combined with an understanding of ice flow dynamics to map deposit signatures at surface and efficiently guide mineral exploration during glacial sediment surveys at local scales.
