The environmental behavior of radioactive cesium (RCs) in contaminated areas is generally governed by soil and sediment components and natural weathering conditions. In this study, desorption tests and spectroscopic approaches were used to explore the interaction between the weathering of micaceous minerals (i.e., biotite and phlogopite) and the adsorption of Cs+ and the critical role of weathering in the environmental behavior of RCs. Results showed that the reaction sequence between weathering and Cs+ adsorption significantly affected the surface species of Cs+ and the structure of biotite and phlogopite. Regardless of whether it occurred before, after, or during Cs+ adsorption, weathering generated more high-affinity adsorption sites, namely, interlayer sites (ITs) and frayed edge sites (FESs), to different extents, and then facilitated the uptake of Cs+ at FESs and ITs on micaceous minerals in a poorly exchangeable state. Cs+ stabilized the micaceous mineral structure once it was absorbed within collapsed interlayers by hindering cation exchange and preventing further destruction during weathering. As important weathering factors, high temperature and Ca2+ content promoted the binding of Cs+ in the interlayers of biotite and phlogopite by enhancing interlayer cation exchange. These findings are beneficial for a better understanding of the environmental behaviors of RCs in the hydrosphere and pedosphere.
