With the increasing application of porous asphalt pavement in expressways, it is necessary to develop recycling technology for porous asphalt pavement. To this end, the performance of the mineral-oil-based rejuvenating agent of the aged high viscosity modified asphalt for Porous Asphalt Pavement is investigated in this paper. Firstly, the rejuvenating mechanism of the high viscosity modified asphalt used for porous asphalt mixture was analyzed, and a special mineral-oil-based rejuvenating agent RZJ-01 for the high viscosity modified asphalt was developed. Secondly, the rejuvenating effect of the rejuvenated high viscosity modified asphalt with the developed rejuvenating agent was analyzed under different aging degrees. According to the results, the use of rejuvenating agent effectively improved the performance of aged high viscosity asphalt. As the amount of the rejuvenating agent increased, the microstructure of the high viscosity modified asphalt underwent small changes, but its rheological properties also changed to varying degrees. The rutting factor of the recycled asphalt decreased with the increase of rejuvenating agent content, and the creep compliance of recycled asphalt decreased firstly and then increased. At the amount of rejuvenating agent at 4%, the rejuvenated high viscosity modified asphalt exhibited the best creep recovery. Besides, the rejuvenating agent also significantly improved the elastic recovery ability of the aged asphalt. Finally, the analysis of the pavement performance of the recycled porous asphalt mixture, the results showed that the performance of high temperature rutting resistance, water damage resistance, low-temperature crack resistance and raveling resistance of the recycled porous asphalt mixture were significantly improved, and the rejuvenating agent for porous asphalt mixture can reliably prolong the life of porous asphalt pavement.
