Low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) prevalent in soil environments may influence the transport, fate, and orientation of microplastics (MPs) by mediating mineral interfaces. Nevertheless, few studies have reported their impact on the environmental behavior of MPs in soil. Here, the functional regulation of oxalic at mineral interfaces and its stabilizing mechanism for MPs were investigated. The results showed that oxalic drove MPs stability onto minerals and new adsorption pathways, which are dependent on the bifunctionality of minerals induced by oxalic acid. Besides, our findings reveal that in the absence of oxalic acid, the stability of hydrophilic and hydrophobic MPs on kaolinite (KL) mainly displays hydrophobic dispersion, whereas electrostatic interaction is dominant on ferric sesquioxide (FS). Moreover, the amide functional groups ([NHCO]) of PA-MPs may have positive feedback on the stability of MPs. In the presence of oxalic acid (2–100 mM), the MPs stability efficiency and property onto minerals were integrally increased in batch studies. Our results demonstrate the oxalic acid-activated interfacial interaction of minerals via dissolution coupled O-functional groups. Oxalic-induced functionality at mineral interfaces further activates electrostatic interaction, cation bridge effect, hydrogen forces, ligand exchange and hydrophobicity. These findings provide new insights into the regulating mechanisms of oxalic-activated mineral interfacial properties for environmental behavior of emerging pollutants.
