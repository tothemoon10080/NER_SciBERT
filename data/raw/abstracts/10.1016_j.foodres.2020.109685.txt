Common bean cotyledons are rich in minerals (Mg, Ca, Fe and Zn), but they also contain natural barriers that can potentially prevent mineral absorption during digestion. In this study, both the cell wall integrity and mineral chelators/antinutrients (phytic acid and pectin) were investigated as natural barriers in common bean cotyledons. To examine the cell wall integrity as a physical barrier for mineral diffusion, soluble mineral content was determined in a cooked cotyledon sample before and after disruption of intact cell walls. While this study showed that the cell wall in cooked common bean cotyledons does not hinder mineral diffusion, it also demonstrated that the presence of antinutrients decreases mineral bioaccessibility. It was shown that a certain mineral fraction is naturally bound to phytic acid and/or pectin and, by enzymatically degrading these antinutrients, the antinutrient-chelated mineral fraction decreased. Moreover, although pH changes are occurring during simulated digestion experiments, which might affect charge of the antinutrients and thus their chelating capacity for minerals, no difference in mineral distribution over antinutrients was observed due to digestion. In addition, this study showed that mineral bioaccessibility in common bean cotyledons could be potentially increased by degrading antinutrients during digestion in the small intestinal phase.
