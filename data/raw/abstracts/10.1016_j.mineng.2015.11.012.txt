Coarse mineral particles exhibit poor conventional flotation efficiency because of many factors, including the low carrying capacity of bubbles, bubble/particle adhesion problems due to cell turbulence, and low degrees of liberation (low hydrophobicity). Many attempts to improve the recovery of coarse fractions have been explored, such as floto-elutriation operating at a high solid content while dispersed in a fluidized (or expanded) bed formed with a continuous injection of compressed air and an uprising water flow. This work analyzed the comparative performances of floto-elutriation (FE) and conventional flotation (CF) on a classified copper sulfide mineral feed as an example of a difficult-to-liberate low-grade ore. Contrary to expectations, CF and FE (Hydrofloat) displayed similar particle recovery rates with feed size distributions for P80s of 130, 240 and 280μm. However, metallurgical recoveries from classified fractions of −297+210μm were 25% higher in FE than in CF and as expected, coarse (+297μm) particles were not recovered in the CF, but in the FE. The recovery of fine fractions in the FE process was due to high hydraulic entrainment and surprisingly the recovery of intermediate and liberated fractions (+74−149μm) was very low, due to its low air hold-up. However, the enhancement of the holdup in FE increased the recovery of these mid-sized fractions. Because of the hydraulic carryover caused by the bubbles and water elutriation, the metallurgical grades obtained in all cases were very low compared to conventional bench flotation. It is believed that this FE equipment works better with coarse, narrowly classified particles and high-grade feeds and that performance decreases for low-grade ores requiring high liberation. Certain features of these findings are visualized.
