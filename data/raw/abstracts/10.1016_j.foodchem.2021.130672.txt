In this study, mineral composition, centesimal composition and lead were evaluated in pine nut seeds (raw and cooked) from five Brazilian states. Mineral composition was determined by ICP OES and lead by GF AAS. The results for minerals were evaluated by Boxplot, PCA and HCA, using the R software. Average minerals in raw and cooked samples (mg 100 g−1) were: 15.2 and 10.8 (Ca), 0.168 and 0.113 (Cu), 0.506 and 0.330 (Fe), 536 and 420 (K), 51.3 and 40.6 (Mg), 0.373 and 0.208 (Mn), 132 and 102 (P) and 0.746 and 0.520 (Zn). The average centesimal composition (raw and cooked) was: 53.5 and 47.2% (moisture), 1.76 and 1.26% (ash), 3.90 and 3.53% (protein), 40.8 and 48.0% (carbohydrate) and 179 and 206 kcal/100 g (total caloric value) and Pb was not detected. The chemometric analysis showed a distinction of raw and cooked samples due to significant nutrient losses after thermal processing.
