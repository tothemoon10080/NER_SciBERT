VUV/UV photodegradation is a promising method that utilizes energetic photons and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated via the photo-dissociation of H2O and O2 to degrade VOCs. In the paper, we investigated the efficiency of removal and mineralization in humid air and the effects of key factors. Toluene of 4–20 ppm can be almost completely removed in 60 s and mineralization efficiency is above 55% at 25 min. 185 nm ultraviolet light plays a key role in the rapid removal and mineralization of toluene. Appropriate amount of O2 and H2O promote the removal of toluene due to the generation of ROS. Based on the intermediates and degradation pathway analysis, it is found that in the presence of O2, degradation pathways of toluene are more abundant and fewer linear-chain aldehydes are produced, thus resulting in higher mineralization efficiency. This work highlights the importance of practical application of VUV/UV photodegradation in humid air.
