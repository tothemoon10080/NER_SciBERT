Glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide, has been linked to adverse effects on human health and non-target species. We report a highly efficient light-activated catalytic mineralization of glyphosate by Pd@BiVO4/BiOBr dual heterojunction photocatalyst. Rapid degradation of glyphosate by Pd@BiVO4/BiOBr was achieved within 5Â min of the reaction. The palladium decoration of BiVO4/BiOBr nanocomposite enhanced the degradation four times. The glyphosate photocatalytic mineralization pathway was investigated via the determination of the degradation products. Pd@BiVO4/BiOBr photocatalyst displayed high stability after six glyphosate degradation cycles. Such results pave the way for sustainable catalytic technologies to minimize the global impact of pesticides.
