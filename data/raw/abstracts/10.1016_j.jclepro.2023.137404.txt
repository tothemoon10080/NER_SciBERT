Binary catalyst composed of alkali metal and alkaline earth metal was widely used to overcome the shortcoming of single-metal catalyst. However, the synergistic mechanism between components remains unclear. In present work, sodium and calcium were loaded into the coal char individually or together. TGA gasification was used to investigate catalytic effect. In order to evaluate catalytic mechanism, Raman spectra of gasification residue, Raman spectra of quenched slag and phase composition at thermodynamic equilibrium were obtained. Loading of sodium or calcium significantly increased gasification rate of coal char and catalytic effect of sodium was better than calcium. Above 900 °C, catalytic effect of sodium-calcium binary catalyst was better than that of single catalyst, and gasification residue of binary catalyst loaded char had more calcium silicate and less sodium silicate than gasification residue of single-metal catalyst loaded char. It was speculated that calcium reacted first with silica in coal to inhibit sodium inactivation. Raman spectra of quenched slag and theoretical calculation showed that silica preferentially reacted with calcium oxide to form calcium silicate in calcium oxide-sodium carbonate-silica system, which proved above speculation. Furthermore, the significant catalytic activity of binary catalysts inhibited the graphitization evolution of carbon structure during char gasification, which is conducive to the improvement of gasification rate.
