Reconfigurable Vibrating Screen (RVS) machine is an innovative beneficiation solution designed for screening mineral particle into various sizes and volumes demanded by the customers at any particular time in a cost-effective manner. In order to ensure optimal functionality, reliability and maintain ability of the RVS machine when used in the mining industry. There is a need to investigate the performace of this machine using smart measurement and monitoring technology in order to effective using data acquisition system; DAQ which recover raw perfromance data via the sensor connencted to be machine. Multi-point modelling experiments were conducted in order to measure stress distributions on various sub-components of the RVS machine at different configurations of 305 mm × 610 mm, 305 mm × 1220 mm and 610 mm × 1220 mm respectively. Furthermore, sets of experiments were conducted to determine the stress distribution experienced on the RVS machine structure using the worst loading conditions. The results of the experimental study revealed that the current stresses on the RVS machine subsystems during the granite run-off particles screening operation are subjected to pressure of 5.01 MPa, 1.25 MPa, 0.55 MPa, 0.37 MPa and 1.76 MPa, which are less than the critical or maximum threshold stress limits of these RVS machine subsystems of 20.8 MPa, 7.4 MPa, 4.3 MPa, 16.3 MPa and 13.6 MPa respectively as determined through simulation.
