Deficiency of oxygen supply is an inevitable problem in the treatment of bone defects or fractures. In addition, an adequate supply of major mineral elements (Ca and P) is also required for efficient new bone formation. In this study, we developed a novel nanofibrous membrane to provide oxygen and essential mineral elements for enhanced osteogenesis, which was fabricated from Poly L lactic-acid (PLLA), calcium peroxide (CPO) and black phosphorus (BP). The results in vitro demonstrated that the obtained composite nanofibers promoted the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) due to the sustained supply of oxygen, Ca and P element. And under the NIR exposure, the osteogenic properties of composite nanofibers were further improved. Furthermore, the results in vivo confirmed that the composite nanofibers has good biocompatibility and osteoinductive activity. Considering the unique oxygen-generating, osteogenic properties and NIR-responsive behavior, we believed that the developed composite nanofibers have great application potential in the field of bone regenerative medicine.
