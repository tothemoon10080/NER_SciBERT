Chronic kidney disease is common and causes significant morbidity including shortened lifespans and decrease in quality of life for patients. The major cause of mortality in chronic kidney disease is cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease within the chronic kidney disease population is closely tied with disordered calcium and phosphorus metabolism and driven in part by renal bone disease. The complex nature of renal, bone, and cardiovascular diseases was renamed as mineral and bone disorder of chronic kidney disease to encompass how bone disease drives vascular calcification and contributes to the development of long-term cardiovascular disease, and recent data suggest that managing bone disease well can augment and improve cardiovascular disease status. Pediatric nephrologists have additional obstacles in optimal mineral and bone disorder of chronic kidney disease management such as linear growth and skeletal maturation. In this article, we will discuss cardiovascular and bone diseases in chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease patients with a focus on pediatric issues and concerns.
