The elasticity modulus and hardness of various phases in 4-year-old Portland cement paste, cement paste containing fly ash, granulated blast furnace slag (BFS) or steel slag at low water/binder ratio were determined by the statistical nanoindentation technique. The influences of different mineral admixtures on mechanical properties of individual phases were comparatively analysed. The pores were not detected in cement paste containing mineral admixtures, which exhibit the extremely dense microstructure at 4 years. Most phases were HD C–S–H and UHD C–S–H in all 4-year-old pastes. The addition of different mineral admixtures does not affect the mechanical property of each phase but alters its volume fraction in cement paste. The incorporation of mineral admixtures reduces the volume fraction of LD C–S–H but remarkably increases the volume fraction of high stiffness C–S–H, especially UHD C–S–H. The total amount of C–S–H in 4-year-old cement paste containing BFS is the highest. The 4-year-old cement paste containing steel slag has the largest amount of high stiffness C–S–H. Increasing curing age increases the volume fraction of high stiffness C–S–H compared with reported data in the literature.
