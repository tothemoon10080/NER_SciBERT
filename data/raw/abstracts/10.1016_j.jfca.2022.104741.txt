Organic farming is an environment-friendly agricultural system able to eliminate negative impacts of chemicals on agricultural lands and environment. Experiments were conducted in 2020 and 2021 growing seasons to investigate the effects of organic-certificated liquid fertilizers obtained from seaweed extracts on morphological and technological traits and mineral composition of beans(Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Organic-certified fertilizers namely as Hygro Amin (HAM), Hygro Algin (HAL) and Rooting Plus (RP) obtained from seaweed were used as fertilizer sources. Positive effects were especially encountered on seed yield, cooking time, number of dispersed seeds after cooking and mineral composition (Fe, Zn, Na, Mg). Biplot analysis on morphological and technological traits and mineral composition revealed that there were positive relationships among Fe, Co, seed yield, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per plant, plant height and the first pod height since these parameters had close vector lengths to each other and placed into the same region and all hygro algin treatments increased these parameters.
