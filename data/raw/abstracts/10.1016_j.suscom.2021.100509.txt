In order to provide a basis for the development of mineral resources and the implementation of spatial zoning management, the application of fuzzy recognition method in mineral resources allocation is studied and analyzed in this study to promote the optimal allocation of mineral resources and establish a reasonable regional division of labor and cooperation relationship. The results show that, taking the suitability of mineral resources spatial development as the evaluation objective, on the basis of the analysis of influencing factors and mechanism of mineral resources development, the index system, index calculation method, regionalization discriminant system and matrix discriminant model for the functional regionalization of mineral resources development are constructed, which has important reference value for promoting the system of optimum allocation of mineral resources. From the comprehensive perspective of quantity, quality, and concentration of resources, a set of comprehensive evaluation indexes and calculation methods reflecting the basic conditions of regional mineral resources (resource abundance) are proposed. Through empirical research, the index system and method of functional zoning of mineral resources development are verified, and the development function zoning scheme of main solid mineral resources in China is put forward. The results can provide macro decision-making reference for guiding mineral resources exploration, development, utilization and protection according to local conditions, zoning planning, and classification. This suggests that the limited and relatively scarce mineral resources are rationally allocated in order to produce the most suitable commodities and services and obtain the best benefits with the least resource consumption.
