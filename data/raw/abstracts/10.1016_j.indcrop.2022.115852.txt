The aim was to optimise rapeseed straw cellulose fiber mixtures in terms of uniformity (UM) and compressibility (CP) for straw/mineral hybrid natural fiber composite preparation. Response surface methodology (RSM) combined with Box-Behnken design (BBD) was used to investigate the effect of mixing process conditions on UM and CP. The results showed that the optimum UM was 98.6% and CP was 16% when the fiber dispersion time was 130 s, the straw fiber size was 60 mesh and the addition was 6 wt%. Based on this the sustainable composites were prepared, their friction coefficient fade was tested and SEM analysis of the wear surface was carried out in parallel. The results further indicate that a uniform mix contributes to the friction coefficient stability of the composites. This study has valuable implications for the industrial application of straw fibers in the field of sustainable composites.
