Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a ubiquitous molecule in nature that shapes the redox state of planetary surfaces. Given that H2O2 is a major oxidant, isotope effects associated with H2O2 chemistry play a key role in determining triple oxygen isotopic compositions (

However, isotope effects in H2O2 self-decomposition processes, which actively occur in nature due to the thermal instability of H2O2, remains poorly understood. Here, we report a hitherto overlooked large and mass-dependent isotope fractionation in aqueous H2O2 self-decomposition processes quantified in a series of kinetic experiments.

By synthesizing triple oxygen isotope measurements of natural H2O2, ozone, various oxyanions formed in the atmosphere (sulfate, nitrate, perchlorate, and carbonate), and oxygen-bearing secondary minerals in meteorites, we find that a decoupled

Our results shed fresh insights into recent debates on the role of H2O2 in the formation of these secondary minerals in the modern Earth, geological past, and other planets. The isotope effect experimentally quantified in this study are needed for future improvements of planetary atmosphere and solar nebular evolution models. We highlight the importance of further experimental and theoretical efforts to quantify isotope effects in H2O2 chemistry that are representative of natural systems.
