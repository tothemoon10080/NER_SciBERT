On the Red Sea coast, Abu Rusheid area is located south Marsa Alam City (90 km) in the south Eastern Desert. Khour Abalea as a part of the Abu Rusheid area extends for about 1.0 km in E-W direction. It is subdivided into two main branches; the first one (the longest) extends about 0.7 km in E-W direction with 10–30 m in passing through mylonites, whereas the second branch extends about 0.5 km in ENE-WSW with about 5–20 m in width and passing through mylonites and ultra-mylonites. Microscopically, this rock is composed mainly of k-feldspars, plagioclases, biotite, and quartz as the main minerals, while the accessories include fluorite, allanite, secondary uranium (kasolite), and zircon. The hydrothermal alteration that occurs during the interaction of hydrothermal fluid and rock results in an M-W type tetrad effect range of 1.72–3.66 in the normalized REE chondrite patterns of the Khour Abalea mylonite rocks. The identified heavy minerals associated with Khour Abalea mylonite rocks can be categorized as a) radioactive minerals (soddyite, kasolite, thorite and uranothorite), b) rare earth minerals (monazite, xenotime and rare earth silicate), c) Nb–Ta minerals (columbite, fergusonite, ishikawaite and aeschynite), d) precious metals (gold, silver minerals (argentite, arcubisite and matildit), e) base metals (cassiterite, wolframite, chalcocite, galena, sphalerite pyrite and Bi minerals (bismite, bismuthinite and perite) and f) accessory mineral (zircon). According to the uranium mobilization equations, there are uranium enrichment in Khour Abalea mylonite.
