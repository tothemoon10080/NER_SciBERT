The pressure dissolution behaviour of pyrite was investigated via its polarisation curve and using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a FeCl3 solution under differential stress. The results showed that the pyrite pressure dissolution process is a galvanic corrosion process and that there is a negative linear relationship between the pyrite potential difference and the stress action. The EIS experiments confirm that the pyrite was in a passive state in a 0.0010molL−1 FeCl3 solution and that a thin surface layer of Fe1−

                     S2 was present. In a 0.010molL−1 FeCl3 solution, the pyrite was in a trans-passive state, in which the aforementioned passive layer became porous. In a 0.10molL−1 FeCl3 solution, the pyrite was in an active state, the surface layer dissolved completely, and a lattice layer of

Under the present stress conditions, the stress action did not change the pyrite electrochemical dissolution mechanism; however, the conditions decreased the charge transfer resistance and passive resistance and increased the species diffusion capacitance.
