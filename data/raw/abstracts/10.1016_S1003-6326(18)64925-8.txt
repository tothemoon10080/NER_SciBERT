The Kaerqueka polymetallic deposit, Qinghai, China, is one of the typical skarn-type polymetallic ore deposits in the Qimantage metallogenic belt. The dynamic mechanism on the formation of the Kaerqueka polymetallic deposit is always an interesting topic of research. We used the finite difference method to model the mineralizing process of the chalcopyrite in this region with considering the field geological features, mineralogy and geochemistry. In particular, the modern mineralization theory was used to quantitatively estimate the related chemical reactions associated with the chalcopyrite formation in the Kaerqueka polymetallic deposit. The numerical results indicate that the hydrothermal fluid flow is a key controlling factor of mineralization in this area and the temperature gradient is the driving force of pore-fluid flow. The metallogenic temperature of chalcopyrite in the Kaerqueka polymetallic deposit is between 250 and 350 Â°C. The corresponding computational results have been verified by the field observations. It has been further demonstrated that the simulation results of coupled models in the field of emerging computational geosciences can enhance our understanding of the ore-forming processes in this area.
