The geochemical processes and thermodynamic behavior of dissolved and precipitated carbonate minerals controlling the hydrochemistry of an aquifer in the seawater/freshwater mixing zone of a small island are identified. Field and laboratory analyses, geochemical modeling (PHREEQC) and multivariate statistical analysis (MSA) provide a quantitative interpretation for the geochemistry of the carbonate-dominated aquifer. Geochemical analyses and modeling results show that dissolution and re-precipitation of CaCO3 are the prevalent processes governing geochemical reactions in the mixing zone. Furthermore, this was confirmed by coherent statistical output that incorporates Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and k-means Cluster Analysis (k-CA). Generally, the composition of the lowland sandy soil was rather homogeneous and was primarily composed of quartz, aragonite, calcite and Mg-calcite. Thermodynamic model calculations indicate that the carbonate minerals calcite, aragonite and dolomite are supersaturated in the mixing zone. Nevertheless, Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) examination verified the occurrence of low-Mg-calcite (LMC) and the absence of dolomite, attributed to thermodynamic/kinetic hindrance, cation disorder and the presence of dolomite crystal growth rate inhibitors (such as SO4). The results suggest that dissolution of aragonite and precipitation of LMC drives the solid phase geochemistry in the small tropical island aquifer.
