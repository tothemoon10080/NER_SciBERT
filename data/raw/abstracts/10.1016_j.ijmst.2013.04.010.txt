Because of the low grade, high oxidation rate and the accumulation of little associated metal sulfide ore in the molybdenum concentrate during flotation, the Qingyang molybdenum ore is difficult to beneficiate. The experimental studies of grinding fineness, the amount of roughing modifier, depressant and collector were completed. In the cleaning process, the contrast experiments of one regrinding, the regrinding and scrubbing, two-stage regrinding was carried. The result shows that the grade of molybdenum ore concentrate is 45.31%, the recovery is 65.98% and the rich ore ratio reaches 20.59% by the regrinding and scrubbing seven cleaning, the regrinding of concentrations from middling of molybdenum-sulfur separation. The regularly-concentrated material from the apparatus was as the middling products. Hence, ideal beneficiation index can be obtained with a rational mineral processing, which offers new beneficiating technology for the refractory low-grade molybdenum ore in China.
