Endochondral ossification in the growth plate of long bones involves cartilage mineralization, bone formation and the budding vasculature. Many of these processes take place in a complex and dynamic zone, the provisional ossification zone, of the growth plate. Here we investigate aspects of mineralization in 2D and 3D in the provisional ossification zone at different length scales using samples preserved under cryogenic or fully hydrated conditions. We use confocal light microscopy, cryo-SEM and micro-CT in the phase contrast mode. We show in 9 week old BALB/c mice the presence of vesicles containing mineral particles in the blood serum, as well as mineral particles without membranes integrated with the blood vessel walls. We also observe labeled mineral particles within cells associated with bone formation, but not in the hypertrophic cartilage cells that are involved with cartilage mineralization. High resolution micro-CT images of fresh hydrated tibiae, show that there are open continuous pathways between the blood vessel extremities and the hypertrophic chondrocyte zone. As the blood vessel extremities, the mineralizing cartilage and the forming bone are all closely associated within this narrow zone, we raise the possibility that in addition to ion transport, mineral necessary for both cartilage and bone formation is also transported through the vasculature.
