This work studied the effect of increasing degree of metamorphism on the properties of rocks. The properties investigated are the physical, mechanical and dynamic parameters. They are important inputs in the design of many mining and civil engineering techniques such as in tunnelling, slope stability and dynamic activities associated with seismicity and fragmentation. This work compared the degree of metamorphism examined through petrographic studies of the Transvaal Sequence in South Africa with the properties of the rocks. The study shows that as the effect metamorphism increases, the state of stress, compaction of grains, cementation and the brittleness of the rocks increases. In addition, increase in the metamorphic effect increases the value of the rock property. The degree of metamorphism of an outcrop is the key factor influencing its property value. Therefore the metamorphism effect of an outcrop may act as a guide to its engineering properties.
