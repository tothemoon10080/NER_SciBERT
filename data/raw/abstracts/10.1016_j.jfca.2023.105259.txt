The present study aimed to determine the variation in mineral nutrition properties for fresh juice of 16 new citrus (C. maxima [Burm. f.] Osbeck × Citrus sinensis [L.] Osbeck) and parental genotypes. The correlation and inheritance estimate for fruit juice mineral nutrients was carried out. The results of present study showed that citrus fruits are valuable source of supplementing essential mineral nutrients in healthy diets. The mineral nutrients concentration in the citrus fruit juice was observed in the range of P (60.76–251.07 mg L-1), K (574.67–1195.47 mg L-1), Ca (153.6–736.0 mg L-1), Mg (23.68–101.76 mg L-1), Fe (1.65–7.37 mg L-1), Zn (1.28–2.97 mg L-1), Mn (0.51–1.24 mg L-1), Cu (0.46–0.84 mg L-1), Na (18.40–45.87 mg L-1) and Cl (17.04–289.68 mg L-1). The citrus genotypes evaluated were significantly different for macro- and micro-nutrients in fruit juice. The citrus hybrid genotypes SCSH-9–6/12, SCSH-9–10/12, SCSH-11–9/13, and SCSH-7–2/12 were found to have superior micro-nutrients. The new citrus hybrids with enhanced mineral nutritional properties than traditional cultivars help in alleviating malnutritional problems. Interspecific hybrids exhibit transgressive segregation for different minerals in juice and several hybrids found with enhanced mineral nutritional properties. Heritability estimates indicated possibility for the selection of genotypes with enhanced mineral nutrients.
