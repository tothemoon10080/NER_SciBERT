Among various modern applications of flotation, mineral processing (which is the original one) is very interesting, not only for the apparent economic reason but for scientific reasons, as well. As in this case, flotation, a unique three-phase process, has really to operate selectively; hence, perhaps it is also the more difficult to study. Scope of the present review is the flotation of salt-type minerals and particularly, magnesite; magnesium belongs to the critical raw materials of the EU. Different physicochemical parameters affecting flotation were discussed, such as adsorption, collectors, organic and inorganic modifiers, surface charge, solubility of minerals, crystal structure, contact angle, and floatability.
