The degradation of diclofenac has been realized for the first time by a piezo-enhanced sonophotocatalytic approach based on ZnO. The sonophotocatalytic degradation showed a slight enhancement in the degradation of the parent compound, whereas strong synergistic effects were observed for the mineralization process when suitable ZnO morphologies are used, reaching 70% of complete degradation of 25 ppm diclofenac using 0.1 g/L ZnO in 360 min. Tests in a complex water matrix show enhanced diclofenac removal, outperforming a TiO2 benchmark photocatalyst. These promising experimental results promote this process as a good alternative to traditional degradation approaches for remediation of real water matrices.
