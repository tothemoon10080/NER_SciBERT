Utilizing sewage sludge (SS) to calcinate sulphoaluminate cement (SAC) is a promising technology for low-carbon transition of cement industry, but the unclear effects of SS-contained heavy metals limit the application of this technology. In this study, the effects of SS addition on the calcination of SAC clinker and the transformation of heavy metals were studied from the aspects of mineral phase change, microstructure evolution and heavy metal speciation respectively, covering the mineral formation temperature 900–1250 °C. The results show that the added SS will reduce the formation temperature and change the reaction pathways of mineral phases. When the content of SS increases from 10% to 25%, the compositions of mesophases CaO·Al2O3 and 4CaO·2SiO2·CaSO4 increase by 6.33% and 9.73%, respectively. Meanwhile, the formation of minerals will solidify Zn, Ni, Mn, Cu, Cr, and convert them into a more stable fraction (residual fraction), indicating a lower probability to harm the environment. Moreover, heavy metals present different migration behaviors. After calcination, Mn migrates from SS to 4CaO·Al2O3·Fe2O3 (52.48%), while Zn prefers to enter 3CaO·3Al2O3·CaSO4 (43.74%) and 4CaO·Al2O3·Fe2O3 (38.06%). This study offers new insights into the mineral formation mechanism and heavy metal transition behaviors of sewage sludge-based SAC.
