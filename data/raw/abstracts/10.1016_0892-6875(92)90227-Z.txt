High molecular weight, water-soluble polyacrylamides and related products have for many years, been used successfully within the Mineral Processing Industry to aid solid-liquid separation.
                  This traditional area of use is discussed with particular emphasis being placed upon the more recent innovations in terms of equipment and modifications, in the use of polyacrylamides, required to meet these new demands.
                  Other areas of application also discussed include dispersants and to a much lesser degree binders and dust suppressants.
                  The final part of the paper is devoted to the role of the latest addition to the polyacrylamide group of products - water absorbent polymers.
