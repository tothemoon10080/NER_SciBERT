Mineralizing CO2 is an effective way to reduce the greenhouse effect. Due to the high cost, most CO2 mineralization projects are basically difficult to be commercialized. Mineralizing CO2 with magnesium salt is an effective and achievable method. The hydrated magnesium carbonate prepared by this method can be used as a functional material, which has great economic benefits. Inspired by biomineralization, nesquehonite (MgCO3·3H2O) was prepared by indirect CO2 mineralization of MgCl2 and (NH4)2·CO3 under the regulation of biosugars. Porous spherical nesquehonite with complex hierarchical structure was synthesized with the addition of 10.5 % dextran at the pH value of 9.5 ± 0.05. The formation mechanism of nesquehonite with different morphologies was further revealed. Under the regulation of dextran, 3D porous nesquehonite spheres are formed by the epitaxial growth of 2D-2D nanoarrays assembled and arranged by nanosheets. This work will provide references for further preparation of hierarchical nesquehonite by CO2 biomimetic mineralization, and give new insights into the formation mechanism of porous spherical nesquehonite.
