The energy demand at Murmansk Oblast in North-East Russia is covered at 60% by fossil fuels and at 40% by electricity. This study estimates the potential for reduction of fossil fuel consumption and CO2-emissions at Murmansk Oblast. The study focus on the municipalities of Apatity and Kirovsk and the apatite ore mining company Apatit JSC . The potential for energy efficiency, reduced fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions is estimated by comparison with the of city Kiruna in Northern Sweden, with a climate similar to that of North-East Russia, and with the iron ore mining company LKAB. This study shows that the potential for reduced CO2-emissions is about 630,700tons CO2 annually in the municipalities of Apatity and Kirovsk or 6.3tons of CO2 per capita, Apatit JSC not included. These results applied on Murmansk Oblast gives a potential for reduced CO2-emissions of about 6Mtons annually in the municipalities together. The specific energy consumption at Apatit JSC is 6â€“7 times per ton product compared to LKAB. The mining has 4 times higher specific energy consumption per ton raw ore compared to LKAB.
