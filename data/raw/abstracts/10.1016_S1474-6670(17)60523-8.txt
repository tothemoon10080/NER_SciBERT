Data logged on mineral benefIclation processes during normal operation are analysed using time series (correlation and spectral) methods to identify the dynamics of the processes for on-line cotaputer control. Recursive least squares estimation techniques are used to identify parametric oodels for a cassiterite flotation circuit and a coal uashery. Identification problem such as the determination of model order, process time delays and the ‘contamination’ of the data by process recycle streams (feedback) are dlscusscd. Typical results are presented in which optimised models are identified from data logged during normal operation.
