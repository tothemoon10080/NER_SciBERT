The Qukulekedong deposit is a recently discovered large Au–Sb deposit in the western part of the East Kunlun Orogenic Belt, NW China. Pyrite with a characteristic dissolution–regrowth texture has developed in the high-grade Au ore of the deposit. In this study, information on the mineralogical properties, elements distribution, and in situ S isotopic composition of the dissolution–regrowth pyrite was used to interpret its genesis and relationship to Au concentration. The pyrite grains are composed of a core, mantle, and rim. The core consists of pyrite with δ34S values ranging from 1.02 ‰ to 1.99 ‰, indicating a neutral pH, medium-oxygen fugacity environment. The mantle consists of sphalerite, sericite, quartz, and ankerite with dissolution texture, indicating pyrite dissolution and replacement in a neutral pH, high-oxygen fugacity environment. The rim consists of pyrite with fine arsenopyrite inclusions and recovers the crystal shape of the pyrite, which have δ34S values ranging from 1.60 ‰ to 2.67 ‰. This indicates that the rim was formed via regrowth in a neutral pH, low-oxygen fugacity environment. The dissolution of the mantle and regrowth of the rim represent an oxygen fugacity increasing–decreasing process in the formation of pyrite. The increase in oxygen fugacity could remobilize Au from dissolved pyrite, forming a highly Au-concentrated hydrothermal fluid. The decrease in oxygen fugacity triggered the supersaturation and precipitation of Au, forming an Au-rich rim. Combining geological characteristics, the pyrite likely had a magmatic sulfur origin and formed via a dissolution-regrowth process caused by the depressurization–oxidation associated with rock fractures. The dissolution-regrowth pyrite can be used as a mineralogical indicator for regional Au exploration.
