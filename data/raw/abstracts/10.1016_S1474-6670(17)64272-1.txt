This paper describes the development for mineral processing operations of advanced control strategies on mini-computer systems and the subsequent implementation of the adopted strategy into dedicated microcomputer-based controllers. Operational experience revealed the shortcomings of earlier systems and these have been eliminated from later systems thus providing a continually improving concept
                  The microcomputer-based controllers that are covered in this paper are used in the following mineral-processing operations: the feeding of raw material to submerged-arc furnaces; the control of electrodes in submerged-arc furnaces, and the multivariable control of milling circuits in gold-extraction operations
                  The key variables to be controlled are either derived variables, as for the electrode controller, or their control is influenced by multivariable interaction, as for the milling circuit. In both cases extensive computation has to be done in the process-control loop. Safeguards also have to be provided so that calculated signals or setpoints that fall outside certain limits are not accepted in the process-control loop
                  Thus, new types of process controllers, more intelligent, and more devoted to the problems encountered in mineral-processing operations, have been developed. An important issue in the development of the controllers was to ensure simplicity of operation and maintenance. Thus, the equipment was designed as 'stand-alone' instruments with simp1e, 'USer - friendly' interfaces to the operator
