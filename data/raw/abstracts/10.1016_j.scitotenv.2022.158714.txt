A large amount of terrigenous organic matter (TOM) is constantly transported to the deep sea. However, relatively little is known about the microbial mineralization of TOM therein. Our recent in situ enrichment experiments revealed that Vibrio is especially enriched as one of the predominant taxa in the cultures amended with natural plant materials in the deep sea. Yet their role in the mineralization of plant-derived TOM in the deep sea remains largely unknown. Here we isolated Vibrio strains representing dominant members of the enrichments and verified their potential to degrade lignin and xylan. The isolated strains were closely related to Vibrio harveyi, V. alginolyticus, V. diabolicus, and V. parahaemolyticus. Extracellular enzyme assays, and genome and transcriptome analyses revealed diverse peroxidases, including lignin peroxidase (LiP), catalase-peroxidase (KatG), and decolorizing peroxidase (DyP), which played an important role in the depolymerization and oxidation of lignin. Superoxide dismutase was found to likely promote lignin oxidation by supplying H2O2 to LiP, DyP, and KatG. Interestingly, these deep-sea Vibrio strains could oxidize lignin and hydrolyze xylan not only through aerobic pathway, but also through anaerobic pathway. Genome analysis revealed multiple anaerobic respiratory mechanisms, including the reductions of nitrate, arsenate, tetrathionate, and dimethyl sulfoxide. The strains showed the potential to anaerobically reduce sulfite and metal oxides of iron and manganese, in contrast the non-deep-sea Vibrio strains were not retrieved of genes involved in reduction of metal oxides. This is the first report about the lignin oxidation mechanisms in Vibrio and their role in TOM mineralization in anoxic and oxic environments of the marginal sea.
