Garlic (Allium sativum L.) is a versatile horticultural commodity with multiple medicinal properties. In this study, we determined the content of macroelements (K, Na, Ca, Mg, P) and microelements (Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe, Cr, Ni, Co, Pb and Cd), the content of phenolic acids (gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid) and L-ascorbic acid in selected cultivars of garlic (Bjetin, Eden Rose, Garpel, Havran, Mojmir, Novozamocky). Statistical analysis indicated, that the Bjetin is characterized mainly by a high content of minerals (Mn, Fe, Ca Co), while Garpel and Mojmir are characterized by higher levels of ferulic acid, gallic acid, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Novozamocky is characterized by a high content of chlorogenic acid. Positive correlations between Pb content and gallic acid, ferulic acid, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid content, and negative correlation between Pb content and chlorogenic acid content were determined.
