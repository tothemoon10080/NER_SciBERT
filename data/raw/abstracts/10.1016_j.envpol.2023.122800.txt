Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been widely utilized, leading to serious contamination. Iron (hydr)oxide transformation was varied in media. Whereas, dynamic transformation effect was extensively unclear. Here, iron (hydr)oxide dynamic transformation-induced PFOA transport and attenuation was investigated by emphasizing initial goethite (α-FeOOH) and associated minerals content and groundwater type based on the multi-process attenuation model. Results revealed that groundwater type did not affect the PFOA attenuation pathway. However, it controlled the iron (hydr)oxide dynamic transformation differences. PFOA transport behavior (retardation factor R from 2.61 to 1.91) was significantly affected by iron (hydr)oxide dynamic transformation. Iron (hydr)oxide transformation induced the greatest PFOA transport risk (R = 1.91, attenuation rate λ = 0.0001 min−1) in SO4
                     2− environment, where complex α-FeOOH, Fe3O4, and β-Fe2O3·H2O transformed to simplex β-FeOOH, leading to instantaneous (K
                     d) and kinetic (α) two-site sorption fraction change. Furthermore, the associated mineral Fe3O4 of goethite was crucial in PFOA attenuation (λ from 0.0001 to 0.0002 min−1). Fe3O4 released Fe2+ and the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ provided electrons, facilitating the formation of F–(CF2)7–COO· radicals, which played a key role in the following cycle attenuation process. This study provides a theoretical basis for understanding the interaction mechanism of PFOA and iron (hydr)oxide dynamic transformation under groundwater differences.
