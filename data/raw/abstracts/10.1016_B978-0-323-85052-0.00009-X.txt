Essential minerals must be incorporated through the diet. They have many functions in the body and if not provided in sufficient amounts, deficiencies are manifested through specific and nonspecific symptoms. However, the amount provided by foods is not always enough to meet nutritional requirements if the bioavailability is low. Bioavailability is defined as the proportion of a nutrient in a food, diet, or dietary supplement that is absorbed and used for normal body functions. In order to become bioavailable, minerals must be absorbable and thus bioaccessible. Mineral bioaccessibility depends on dietary sources and the presence of inhibitors and promoters of absorption. Since low bioavailability mainly concerns iron, zinc, and calcium deficiencies, this chapter focuses on these three minerals. The effects of food processing, consumer trends, and factors related to the host are discussed. Methodologies for measuring bioavailability in humans, methods using laboratory animals, and in vitro methodologies for estimating mineral bioaccessibility are also discussed.
