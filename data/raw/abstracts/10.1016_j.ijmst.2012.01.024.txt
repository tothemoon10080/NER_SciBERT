A liquid–solid fluidized bed separator, used for the separation of coarse slime, was developed. Test particles sized in the range from 0.25 to 0.5, 0.5 to 1.0, and 0.25 to 1.0mm were separated in the liquid–solid fluidized bed. Beds with column heights of 1200, 1500, and 1800mm were tried. The clean coal and the tailings were subsequently analyzed by float–sink testing. The results showed that the ash and yield of clean coal both decreased with increasing column height, for all three size fractions, and that the ash of the clean coal obtained from tests on the broader size fraction was less than that from the narrower sized fractions. The separation density decreased with increasing column height. The lowest E value was seen for a column height of 1500mm, for which conditions the separation density was 1.45g/cm3. The E value was 0.084 for the 0.25–0.5mm fraction but the corresponding separation density was 1.48g/cm3, and the E value 0.089, for the broader 0.25–1.0mm fraction.
