The Fen carbonatite complex, situated in Vestfold and Telemark County, South Norway, is one of the largest known rare earth elements (REE) deposits in Europe with ongoing exploration drilling. Literature regarding the complex processing of the Fen ore is lacking, and thus, the present work investigates for the first time its beneficiation potential and applies process mineralogy studies to understand in a sound manner the performance variations during the processing of REE ore. Flotation kinetics studies revealed that (i) high concentration of total REE-oxide (TREO) can be achieved during rougher flotation; (ii) the high concentration of sulphur (in form of pyrite as main sulphide) can be achieved at the beginning of flotation; (iii) the highest concentration of TREO can be reached after flotation of S. Further processing (i.e., by the addition of cleaning stages and grinding) has a potential to improve the overall recovery of TREO and S. However, the decision of further processing will depend, among other factors, on the definition of following hydrometallurgical routes (e.g., leaching, solvent extraction) and the economic aspects of the overall process. So far, the reported results show that a rather flexible process can be achieved for the material from the Fen deposit.
