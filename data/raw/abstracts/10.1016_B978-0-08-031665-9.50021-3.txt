This chapter discusses the optimal control and stochastic control policies in mineral and metallurgical processing. The process of homogenization and the applications indicate a good performance of the technique that can be carried out in most mining transformations. For practical situations, it is important to determine the sample autocorrelation function of the lot and good estimates of the mean. The application of optimal control techniques has regarded mainly linear and quadratic deterministic optimal control. The specific properties of mineral processing allow a different treatment of the problem and assure the possibility that the results obtained will often dominate those obtainable by the techniques developed above. In the simplest case, the merit function is the sum of the squared deviations of the state and/or the controls the problem reduces to a trivial linear problem, if the merit function contains higher order terms or interaction terms.
