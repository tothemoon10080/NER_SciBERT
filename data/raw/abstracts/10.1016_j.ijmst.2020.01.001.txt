Nanoparticles (NPs) can promote the column flotation process in mining industry. Nanoparticles’ effects on column flotation process (copper recovery, grade and flotation rate constant) are assessed in Sarcheshmeh Copper Complex, Iran, through response surface methodology (RSM) optimization technique. The γ-Al2O3, α-Fe2O3, SiO2, and TiO2 nanoparticles are selected for these experiments. A flotation rate constant is chosen as a response to assess the effect of nanoparticles on flotation in its kinetic sense. The process pH and nanoparticle dosage are selected as the influential parameters. Results obtained from RSM indicated that the maximum percentage of Cu recovery and grade is obtained at pH of 12 and nanoparticle dosage of 6 kg/t, through α-Fe2O3 and γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles, respectively. Applying nanoparticles in particular γ-Al2O3 and α-Fe2O3 increases the Cu recovery by 8–10% together with the grade by 3–6% in a significant manner. It is revealed that nanoparticles could effectively be applied in enhancing the flotation performance.
