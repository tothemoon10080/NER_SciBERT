Wildfire has several environmental and ecological effects on soil biogeochemistry, including the nitrogen (N) cycle in forest ecosystems. In this study with 30 days of incubation, we examined the effect of a fire event on changes in soil properties, especially gross N mineralization and nitrification processes in boreal forest soils. We also tested how the addition and removal of fire-derived natural pyrogenic carbon (PyC, 1.5%) affected N transformation processes. After incubation, the concentrations of NH4
                     +-N, NO3
                     −-N, total N, and dissolved organic N were largely enhanced in the burnt soils compared to the unburnt soils. Fire significantly decreased gross N mineralization rates from 6.88 μg N g−1 d−1 to 0.87 μg N g−1 d−1 and NH4
                     + immobilization rates from 6.04 μg N g−1 d−1 to 0.55 μg N g−1 d−1 but did not significantly affect gross N nitrification rates or NO3
                     − immobilization rates on day 30. The removal from the burnt soil or addition to the unburnt soil of PyC had no significant effect on N transformation. The abundances of nirK, nosZ I, narG, and nifH in the burnt soils were the highest across the different treatments. Our study revealed that fire decreased gross N mineralization processes, which was associated with enhanced abundances of N-cycling genes (nirK, nosZ I and narG) in the boreal forest soils.
