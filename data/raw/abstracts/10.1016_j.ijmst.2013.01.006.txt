Surface miner, a continuous mining machine, is being manufactured in India and abroad owing to enhanced demand of production in various mining industries like coal, limestone, gypsum, bauxite etc. Different types of surface miners are manufactured today based on cutting drum placement and design specifications. Selective mining without drilling and blasting, high production and small size products are some of the prominent attractive features obtained with these moving marvels. This machine can be used with good efficiency in soft to medium hard rock (100â€“120MPa). This paper synthesizes the different applications, equipment models, features offered, operating methods, cutting performance assessment models as well as typical production performance of surface miner in coal and limestone mines of India. Engine hour metre reading, diesel and pick consumptions are linearly influenced by production. The emphasis for future research is also brought out.
