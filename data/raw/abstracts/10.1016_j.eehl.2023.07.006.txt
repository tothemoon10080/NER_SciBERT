Antimony (Sb) in natural water has long-term effects on both the ecological environment and human health. Iron mineral phase transformation (IMPT) is a prominent process for removing Sb(V) from natural water. However, the importance of IMPT in eliminating Sb remains uncertain. This study examined the various Sb–Fe binding mechanisms found in different IMPT pathways in natural water, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms. The study revealed that the presence of goethite (Goe), hematite (Hem), and magnetite (Mag) significantly affected the concentration of Sb(V) in natural water. Elevated pH levels facilitated higher Fe content in iron solids but impeded the process of removing Sb(V). To further our understanding, polluted natural water samples were collected from various locations surrounding Sb smelter sites. Results confirmed that converting ferrihydrite (Fhy) to Goe significantly reduced Sb levels (<5 μg/L) in natural water. The emergence of secondary iron phases resulted in greater electrostatic attraction and stabilized surface complexes, which was the most likely cause of the decline of Sb concentration in natural water. The comprehensive findings offer new insights into the factors governing IMPT as well as the Sb(V) behavior control.
