Rock fall related accidents continue to occur in coal mines, although artificial support mechanisms have been used extensively. Roof stability is primarily determined in many underground mines by a limited number of methods that often resort to subjective criteria. It is argued in this paper that stability conditions of mine roof strata, as a key factor in sustainability in coal mines, must be determined by a survey which proactively investigates fundamental aspects of said mine. Failure of rock around the opening happens as a result of both high rock stress conditions and the presence of structural discontinuities. The properties of such discontinuities affect the engineering behavior of rock masses causing wedges or blocks to fall from the roof or sliding out of the walls. A practical rule-based approach to assess the risk of a roof fall is proposed in the paper. The method is based on the analysis of structural data and the geometry and stability of wedges in underground coal mines. In this regard, an accident causing a huge collapse in a coal mine leading to 4 fatalities is illustrated by way of a case study. Horizontal and vertical profiles are prepared by geophysical methods to define the falling zone and its boundaries. The collapse is then modeled by the use of sophisticated computer programs in order to identify the causes of the accident.
