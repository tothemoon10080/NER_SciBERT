The Shwas-Tayyah and Khadra belts belonging to the Asir terrane include potential mineralization zones, hosted in intensely deformed Precambrian basement rocks. Analysis of geophysical aeromagnetic data and satellite images, constrained by field data, highlights the deep hierarchy and structuring of the An Nimas-Khadra area in its regional litho-structural setting and geodynamic evolution. The N-S and NNE-SSW major trends, with other E-W, NE-SW and NW-SE minor directions, were identified. The Tarj, Ibran, and Junaynah close to N-S oriented master shear zones, delimit and cross the Al Lith-Bidah, Shwas-Tayyah and Khadra belts; they characterize the Asir composite terrane. Structural and kinematic models were highlighted, showing the control of intense deformations on the basement structures. The deep-seated faults are linked to wide tectonic movements induced by regional E-W to ENE-WSW contractional orogenic episodes. The tectonics induced genesis of the accreted terrane rocks with differentiated belts and shear zones. The resulted structures seem to be in accordance with the Riedel model that includes conjugate movements of right-lateral strike slip faults and right-oblique reverse faults.
                  Correlation of geophysical and geochemical analyses is a crucial technique used for better assessment and valorization of mineral resources. The spatial association between the interpreted lineament patterns and mineralization rates testifies the tectonic deformations-mineral deposits relationship. The AHP-based MCDM statistical support model highlights the mining interest areas. The MCDM allows further spatial statistical evaluation and reveals new prospective metal occurrences in the Shwas-Tayyah and Khadra belts. N-S and NNE-SSW lineament networks show the highest mineralization rates, suggesting their priority for more detailed prospections. The metallic mineral deposits have to be related to prominent steeply dipping and brittle-ductile shear zones.
