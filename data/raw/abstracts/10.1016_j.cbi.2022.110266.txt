Mycotoxins are most frequent contaminants in environment and agricultural production globally. The T-2 toxin of Fusarium species is the most toxic type of A trichothecene mycotoxins. T-2 toxin can accumulate in bone and cause bone development disorders. Osteoblast is the functional cell responsible for bone formation. Whereas, the mechanism of T-2 toxin toxicity on osteoblast remains unknown. In present study, MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with 0, 2, 4, and 8 nM T-2 toxin for 24h to explore the effect of T-2 toxin on the differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts. Subsequently, autophagy and Wnt intervention agents were used to explore the roles of autophagy and Wnt signaling pathway in T-2 toxin-induced osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization disorders, respectively. The results showed that 2 nM of T-2 toxin had no significant effect on cell vitality, but 4 and 8 nM of T-2 significantly inhibited cell viability. All doses of T-2 toxin inhibited both osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization, as assessed by alkaline phosphatase staining, Alizarin red S staining, and protein expressions of osteogenic proteins. In addition, the activation of Wnt signaling pathway mitigated T-2 toxin-induced osteoblast impairment, while the inhibition of autophagy exacerbated it. Our results also indicated that there was a positive feedback loop between the Wnt signaling pathway and autophagy.
