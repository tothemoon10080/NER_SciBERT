Inspired by a recent review article on the automation of the mining, mineral, and metal processing industry (MMM), this paper discusses some important “patches” of computer aided measurement processes in the MMM processing industries. Both the evaluation of measurement data, and the real-time control of the measurement processes, will be covered. Notes will be given on the use of machine vision, electrochemical potential, optical emission spectrometry, and X-ray spectrometry. Some visions for the future are offered.
