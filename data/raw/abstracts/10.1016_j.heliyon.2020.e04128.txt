Heterogeneous photocatalysis has become a significant green technology for water treatment. The application of Nb2O5 catalyst for the photodegradation of contaminants has merged as an important tool to this process. Furthermore, it is known that catalytic phases supported on metal oxides are an alternative method for enhancing its activity. In this work, supported Nb2O5 on mixed oxides as catalyst was applied to degrade methylene blue dye, leading to almost 100% of dye degradation without the need of any additives, after only three hours of sunlight exposure. The effect of catalyst concentration, exposure time and light source were investigated. The best catalyst activity was found at 1.5 g Lâˆ’1 and for higher catalyst concentrations the degradation was kept constant. Plausible intermediates of this degradation process were observed and characterized by NMR, LC/MS and CZE techniques. After degradation, the catalyst was recovered and could be further re-applied in other three reaction cycles without significant loss of catalytic activity.
