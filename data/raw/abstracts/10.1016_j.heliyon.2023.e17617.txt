The Ebolowa Municipal Lake (EML) (South Cameroon) in order to identify the early diagenesis processes taking place in the lake and the factors influencing them. To this end, 21 samples were collected. In situ, hydrogen potential, redox potential, conductivity, dissolved oxygen content, and turbidity were measured. In the laboratory, the samples were subjected to mineralogical analysis by X-ray diffraction, geochemical analysis by X-ray fluorescence and ICP-MS, and statistical analysis. The coefficient of variation (Qi) was calculated from the geochemical data. In the water column, OD > 2 mg/L, pH > 7 and Eh < 0 mV. In sediments: pH < 7, Eh values are lower. The contents of 2.08 ≤ TOC ≤ 12.65%. The mineralogical procession consists of quartz, kaolinite, gibbsite, goethite, and siderite. The latter is only present in the EML. The sediments are dominated by SiO2 (60.44–89.47%), Al2O3 (6.55–18.17%), and Fe2O3 (1.15–6.21%). The Qi values range from 0.73 to 2.31. The Mn/Fe ratio values are below 0.40. Qi > 1 for Al, Fe, Mn, Mg, K, Na, P, Ni, Co, Zn, Pb, Cd, Cu, Ba, and V, and Qi < 1 for Si; Qi = 1 for Ca. The hierarchical cluster analysis shows two groups: the first one includes the samples from the central and western parts, while the second one includes those from the eastern and southern parts of the lake. The water column is subject to oxic conditions, while the sediments are anoxic. The rapid consumption of oxygen is due to organic mineralization, which is the main diagenesis observed in the lake. This phenomenon is more accentuated in the western part of the lake.
