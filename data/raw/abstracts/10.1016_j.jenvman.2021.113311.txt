In the present work, TiO2-graphite-phase-carbon-nitride (TiO2/g-C3N4) was prepared through a hydrothermal method to obtain a new photocatalytic material. This material was characterized by means of scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray energy spectrometer (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Solid-state UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectrometry (UV–Vis-DRS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The synthesized TiO2/g-C3N4 exhibited homogeneous morphology, in which TiO2 nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on the g-C3N4 nanosheets. Regarding its potential use as photocatalytic material in the treatment of mineral processing wastewater, 18% TiO2/g-C3N4 showed superior photodegradation performance than TiO2 and g-C3N4, to give 97.1% degradation rate under 100 min of simulated light irradiation. The experimental results showed that the successful incorporation of TiO2 on g-C3N4 nanosheets enhanced the spectral response range of TiO2/g-C3N4, and the photocatalytic activity was improved. In view of that, it can be considered that this kind of photocatalytic material has a good prospect in the treatment of mineral processing wastewater, which would have clearly environmental relevance.
