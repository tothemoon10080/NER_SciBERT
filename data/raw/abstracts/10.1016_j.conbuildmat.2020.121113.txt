The main mineralization process is hydrolysis of the organic phosphomonoester with the alkaline phosphatase produced by the Bacillussubtilis. The structural characterization of phosphate nanomaterials showed that the nanostructures of phosphate could be prepared by the microbial mineralization method. The nano-sized bio-BaHPO4 and bio-BaNaPO4, with an average size 100 nm, could be well synthesized in the supernatant liquid of the bacteria at the pH = 8 and 11, but the nano-sized bio-BaHPO4 and bio-BaNaPO4 were not prepared by the chemical method in the same conditions. The bio-Mg3(PO4)2·5H2O had a honeycomb-like structure, but the chem-Mg3(PO4)2·5H2O was irregular. The average particles size of the bio-Mg3(PO4)2·5H2O was less than the chem-Mg3(PO4)2·5H2O. The bio-Fe3(PO4)2·8H2O, bio-Ca5(PO4)3(OH) and bio-CePO4 could also be prepared by the microbial mineralization method, but the chem-Fe3(PO4)2·8H2O, chem-Ca5(PO4)3(OH) and chem-CePO4 could not be synthesized by a simple chemical reaction. Compared with the Sporosarcina pasteurii induced carbonate precipitation, the Bacillussubtilis induced the formation of phosphates that were more stable than carbonates in the weak acid environments. The Sporosarcina pasteurii induced carbonate precipitation produced a large amount of harmful ammonia, whereas the Bacillussubtilis induced the formation of phosphates that did not produce any harmful gases. According to the literature reported, the microbially-induced phosphate precipitation (MIPP) had the cementitious properties. The cementation mechanism was the bio-phosphates interact with pure quartz sand to form van der Waals bond in the sand columns. Therefore, the use of MIPP can not only apply to the preparation of functional materials, but also has potential applications in the removal of heavy metals, treatment of solid waste, consolidation of sandy soil, and so on.
