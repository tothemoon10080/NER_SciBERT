Thermal processing not only contributes to flavors and textures but also has effects on meat nutrition values. In the current study, the in vitro digestibility and mineral bioaccessibility of oysters (Crassostrea gigas) were reduced after cooking (steaming, baking, and frying). The steamed oysters showed the highest digestibility and mineral bioaccessibility among all the cooking methods. Correlation analysis showed that the digestibility of proteins was negatively correlated with the levels of surface hydrophobicity (r = −0.91, p < 0.01), A420 (r = −0.97, p < 0.01), and fluorescent products (r = −0.98, p < 0.01), while it was positively correlated with sulfhydryl group (r = 0.72, p < 0.01). Moreover, the bioaccessibility of Zn and Fe had a positive correlation with the digestibility. Based on these results, steaming might be a recommended cooking method for our daily diet to preserve the digestibility and mineral bioaccessibility of oysters.
