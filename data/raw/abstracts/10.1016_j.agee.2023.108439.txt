Manure amendments have been generally considered to enhance soil nutrient supply, thus improving soil fertility and crop productivity, especially in subtropical area. However, the underlying mechanisms of manure application effects on soil nitrogen (N) supply capacity and N transformation processes remain uncertain. Here, 15N isotope pool dilution techniques were used to determine the gross rates of N mineralization, ammonium (NH4

Results showed that compared to treatments without manure, manure application alone or combined with chemical fertilizers significantly increased gross N mineralization rates by 4.55−8.31 folds, resulting from increased N-acquiring enzyme activity and decreased microbial N use efficiency (NUE). The decreased microbial NUE in the manure application treatments was due to alleviated imbalance of C:N between soil and microbial biomass. Gross NH4

Compared to chemical fertilizers application, manure application decreased gross nitrification rates by 38−55%, due to the decline in NH4
