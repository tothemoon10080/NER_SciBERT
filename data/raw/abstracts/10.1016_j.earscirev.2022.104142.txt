On-going trade wars combined with the increasing consumption and depletion of known resources will necessitate the search for new deposits in poorly explored or unexplored areas, such as the polar regions. Antarctica is particular among the world's continents in that it has no native population and state sovereignty; the continent has also been identified as potentially harboring extensive hydrocarbon and mineral resources. In order to protect the fragile environment of Antarctic, the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (1991) banned all mineral activities for a 50-year period, except for scientific purposes. The Protocol will be renewed in 2048, and discussion of possible future mining in the region has already begun. With the improvement of drilling and mining technology, the risk of future mining activity on the continent is increasing. Moreover, extensive mining operations in the Arctic demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of mining activities in harsh polar environments. The conservation of the fragile environment of Antarctic must be prioritized and some considerations of renewal of the Protocol on Environmental Protection are discussed in this paper.
