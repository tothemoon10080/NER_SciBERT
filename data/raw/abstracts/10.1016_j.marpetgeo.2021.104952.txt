The first comprehensive provenance studies of the Lower Cretaceous Wessex Basin based on detailed analyses of heavy minerals is presented based on QEMSCAN® (Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals by Scanning Electron Microscopy) analysis. Six heavy mineral assemblages: apatite-dominated, rutile-dominated, tourmaline-dominated, olivine-dominated, ilmenite-dominated and garnet-pyroxene-epidote-dominated were identified in the basin. Heavy mineral assemblages show that the majority of the sediments were recycled from older sediments within the provenances. The identified provenances appeared to be mainly metamorphic in nature. High ATi values indicate little or no secondary modifications to the sediments. Heavy mineral assemblages indicate the dominance of the Cornubian massif as the major source of the materials in the Wessex Basin while Armorican massif represents a minor source. The wider implication of this study is that QEMSCAN® method can be successfully and effectively used for analysing heavy minerals for provenance studies when traditional petrographic/heavy mineral analyses are not available or unreliable.
