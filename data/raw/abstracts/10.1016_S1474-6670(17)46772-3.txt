In order to stay competitive in the mining and mineral processing business, it has become increasingly important to have well functioning automation systems. New requirements on these systems arise from a number of different sources. Customers continuously ask for further refined products of higher quality. This, together with a demand for increased efficiency generates requirements on sophisticated control functionality and display of relevant information to operators and maintenance personnel. Integration of different systems is required in order to improve over-all efficiency and quality of services. Altogether, the new requirements make it increasingly important to be a skilled procurer of computer-based automation systems. This paper presents some practical experience from LKAB in the field of systems integration and discusses whether to separate the procurement of a machine from the procurement of its control system. The results presented should be of interest for automation system suppliers and users effective in all kinds of process and manufacturing industries.
