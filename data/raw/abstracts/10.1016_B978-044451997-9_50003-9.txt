ABSTRACT
               A review of literature on methods to quantify weathering in forest soils revealed that there is very little in situ information on the impact of root-induced changes on mineral weathering dynamics in forest soils owing to the coexistence of soil, roots and associated microorganisms in the rhizosphere. The review also emphasizes the need for the quantification of mineral dissolution rates resulting from weathering in the soil, especially in the rhizosphere. In this chapter, we present a novel scientific approach for estimating weathering in the rhizosphere of forest soils. Our research results to date of two ongoing field case studies in northern and southwestern Sweden are presented to indicate how mineral weathering can be monitored using well-defined techniques. These techniques include homogeneous soil bags (HSB) and test-mineral bags (TMB) of two different meshes, 51 and 541 μm, which either allow the penetration of roots and hyphae (541 μm) or exclude root growth in the bags (51 μm). In these studies, mineral weathering is assessed by scanning electron microscopy and mineral mass losses. Our research results to date from the TMB method suggest that weathering of apatite was much faster in the coarse- than in the fine-mesh bags. These results indicate a higher level biological weathering in the presence of roots and hyphae (as was the case in the 541 μm bags) than in the absence of roots (as was the case in the 51 μm bags). Through our examination of the sites and field treatment effects, and the consequent results on tree growth, we conclude that a consideration of the combined effects of climate and nutrient inputs to forest ecosystems is necessary for a better assessment of the weathering rate of soil minerals in the rhizosphere. Indeed, a proper quantification of mineral dissolution rates resulting from weathering in the rhizosphere would significantly improve the predictive capability of existing growth and biogeochemical models.
