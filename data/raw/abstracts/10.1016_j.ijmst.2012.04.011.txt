The effect of sodium pyrophosphate (SPH) on the separation of chalcopyrite from galena was examined through flotation, adsorption, electrokinetic studies and infrared spectral analysis. Differential flotation tests indicate that satisfactory separation can be achieved within the pH range from 2.5 to 6 using SPH to depress the galena, but not the chalcopyrite when O-isopropyl-N-ethyl thionocarbamate (IPETC) is used as the collector. The electrophoretic mobilities of both the minerals dramatically become negatively charged following SPH adsorption in the pH range from 2.5 to 12. The infrared spectral analysis suggests that chemical adsorption occurs on galena surface treated by SPH, indicating that a chelate complex has formed. At weakly acidic pH values, the adsorption density of IPETC onto galena is significantly reduced in the presence of SPH. However, the amount of IPETC adsorbed onto chalcopyrite almost remains at the same level. Since the observed adsorption density of IEPTC onto chalcopyrite is quite high compared to galena, the observed flotation results are explained. A possible mechanism for the interaction between the two sulphide minerals and SPH is discussed.
