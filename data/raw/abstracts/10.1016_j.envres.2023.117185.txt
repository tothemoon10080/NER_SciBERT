A comparative degradation of antibiotic cefaclor (CEC) between Ti/Ti4O7 and Ti/RuO2 anodes, in terms of degradation kinetics, mineralization efficiency, and formation of toxic chlorate (ClO3
                     −) and perchlorate (ClO4
                     −), was performed with electrochemical-oxidation (EO), electro-Fenton (EF), and photoelectro-Fenton (PEF) processes. Besides, CEC degradation by EF with boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode was also tested. Results showed CEC decays always followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, with increasing apparent rate constants in the sequence of EO < EF < PEF. The mineralization efficiency of the processes with Ti/Ti4O7 anode was higher than that of Ti/RuO2 anode, but slightly lower than that of BDD anode. Under the optimal conditions, 94.8% mineralization was obtained in Ti/Ti4O7-PEF, which was much higher than 64.4% in Ti/RuO2-PEF. The use of Ti/RuO2 gave no generation of ClO3
                     − or ClO4
                     −, while the use of Ti/Ti4O7 yielded a small amount of ClO3
                     − and trace amounts of ClO4
                     −. Conversely, the use of BDD led to the highest generation of ClO3
                     − and ClO4
                     −. The reaction mechanism was studied systematically by detecting the generated H2O2 and •OH. The initial N of CEC was released as NH4
                     + and, in smaller proportion, as NO3
                     −. Four short-chain carboxylic acids and nine aromatic intermediates were also detected, a possible reaction sequence for CEC mineralization was finally proposed.
