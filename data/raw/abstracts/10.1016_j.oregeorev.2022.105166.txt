Late Triassic granites and related magmatic-hydrothermal Mo-W mineralization are common in the South Qinling orogen of central China, for which the Sihaiping granite pluton is a typical example. However, the petrogenesis of the Sihaiping granite remains enigmatic. Unraveling its petrogenesis can aid in our understanding of the Mo-W metallogeny in the South Qinling orogen. In this study, we present in situ zircon U-Pb ages, whole-rock geochemistry, and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopes of the Sihaiping granite. Zircon U-Pb dating by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy yielded Late Triassic ages of 206.6 ± 0.94, 206.5 ± 0.96, and 205.9 ± 0.75 Ma. The granite displayed high SiO2, K2O, and Rb contents, but low MgO, P2O5, TiO2, Sr, Ba, and Eu contents, indicating highly fractionated I-type granite affinity. The magma was interpreted to have been derived from Proterozoic crystalline basement in the South Qinling given its relatively low (87Sr/86Sr)i (0.704006 to 0.705039), negative εNd(t) (–4.9 to –3.5), and zircon εHf(t) (–6.2 to +1.6) values, with Nd model ages ranging from 1.39 to 1.27 Ga and two-stage Hf model ages ranging from 1.36 to 1.04 Ga. The strong fractional crystallization and suitable oxygen fugacity (ΔFMQ values mainly concentrated between +2 to +8) in the magmatic system played a major role in the Mo-W mineralization, indicating that the pluton has significant Mo(-W) metallogenic potential. Overall, the findings suggest that the Triassic Sihaiping granite and its related Mo-W mineralization likely formed in the transitional stage from syn- to post-collision between the South China Block and South Qinling along the Mianlue suture.
