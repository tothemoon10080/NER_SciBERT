An alternative procedure for the processing of monazite mineral concentrate has been suggested. This procedure is based on a prior separation of the REEs and Th oxalates from the sulfate liquor of the hydrous oxide cake obtained after alkali breakdown of monazite concentrate.
                  From the mixed oxalate precipitate, it was possible to optimize the selective alkali dissolution of Th using a mixed Na2CO3/NaHCO3 solution. Highly pure oxide products of the three interesting metal values; viz REEs, Th and U have properly been prepared.
