The flocculation effect of the Phanerochaete chrysosporium on the coal slurry were studied by orthogonal experimental method in this study. The results of research show that the P. chrysosporium has a good effect on flocculating coal slurry. The optimum combination of the experimental is the P. chrysosporium, which is cultured in 2 days, mixed with 2 mL coagulant and 2 mL broth. The flocculant is a broken liquid with pH value of 6. The hightest flocculation ratio is 93.5%. The result of FTIR shows that the biological extraction of P. chrysosporium contains a lot of acidic polysaccharides that has the effect on flocculation. Microbial flocculant molecules and particles of coal slurry could be flocculated by “absorption bridge”.
