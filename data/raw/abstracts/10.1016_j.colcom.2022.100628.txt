The demand for food is increasing annually worldwide. There is, therefore, a pressing need to increase crop yields and the area available for crop production. To achieve sustainability in crop production, macro, micro, and nanoparticles have been applied in agriculture. The development of synthetic particles plays an important role in crop management. In an effort to improve the efficiency of mineral delivery to plants, we synthesized a novel calcium-based Si hybrid mineral. The mineral delivery efficacy of this material was determined by applying it to Arabidopsis culture. Analysis of the hybrid mineral indicated that it contains Ca2+, Si, and carbonate sources, which are useful in increasing crop yields and protecting plants against pathogens. Thus, this novel CaCO3â€“CaSi hybrid mineral acts synergistically on Arabidopsis root growth and confers resistance to bacterial pathogens by playing critical roles in various plant metabolic processes, thereby enhancing crop yield and protection.
