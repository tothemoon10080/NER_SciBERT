Liposomes are versatile lipid-based vesicles with interesting physicochemical properties, making them excellent candidates for interdisciplinary applications in the medicinal, biological, and environmental sciences. The synthesis of mineral-liposome hybrid systems lends normally inert vesicles with the catalytic, magnetic, electrical, and optical properties of the integrated mineral species. Such applications require an understanding of the physicochemical interactions between organic molecules and inorganic crystal structures. This review provides an overview on these interactions and details on synthesis and characterization methods for these systems.
