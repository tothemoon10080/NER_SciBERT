Background
                  Previously we reported a manual method of measuring thoracic vertebral bone mineral density (BMD) using quantitative CT in noncontrast cardiac CT scans used for coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring. In this report, we present validation studies of an artificial intelligence–based automated BMD measurement (AutoBMD) that recently received FDA approval as an opportunistic add-on to CAC scans.
               
                  Methods
                  A deep learning model was trained to detect vertebral bodies. Subsequently, signal processing techniques were developed to detect intervertebral discs and the trabecular components of the vertebral body. The model was trained using 132 CAC scans comprising 7,649 slices. To validate AutoBMD, we used 5,785 cases of manual BMD measurements previously reported from CAC scans in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.
               
                  Results
                  Mean ± SD for AutoBMD and manual BMD were 166.1 ± 47.9 mg/cc and 163.1 ± 46 mg/cc, respectively (P = .006). Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis cases were 47.5% male and 52.5% female, with age 62.2 ± 10.3. A strong correlation was found between AutoBMD and manual measurements (R = 0.85, P < .0001). Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for AutoBMD-based detection of osteoporosis were 99.6%, 96.7%, 97.7%, 99.7% and 99.8%, respectively. AutoBMD averaged 15 seconds per report versus 5.5 min for manual measurements (P < .0001).
               
                  Conclusions
                  AutoBMD is an FDA-approved, artificial intelligence–enabled opportunistic tool that reports BMD with Z-scores and T-scores and accurately detects osteoporosis and osteopenia in CAC scans, demonstrating results comparable to manual measurements. No extra cost of scanning and no extra radiation to patients, plus the high prevalence of asymptomatic osteoporosis, make AutoBMD a promising candidate to enhance patient care.
