Desalination activities around the world are increasing as a result of water scarcity. The discharge of brine from desalination processes poses a significant threat to the environment. Large amounts of water, energy and minerals remain unexploited and are wasted in brine discharged from desalination plants. Due to more stringent environmental regulations and the need for more cost-effective desalination processes, sustainable brine management is critical for the utilization of these untapped resources within brine. In this review, current environmental regulations from different regions around the world were highlighted and compared. Various technologies and processes from the perspective of water, energy and mineral recovery have been discussed with the aim of achieving sustainable brine management. The advantages and disadvantages of these technologies have also been analyzed. Various case studies were provided at laboratory, pilot and industrial scale levels. The outlook and insight provided in this review will contribute to achieving sustainable brine management.
