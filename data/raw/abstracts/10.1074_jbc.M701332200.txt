Mineral crystal nucleation in UMR 106-01 osteoblastic cultures occurs within 15–25-μm extracellular vesicle-containing biomineralization foci (BMF) structures. We show here that BAG-75 and BSP, biomarkers for these foci, are specifically enriched in laser capture microscope-isolated mineralized BMF as compared with the total cell layer. Unexpectedly, fragments of each protein (45–50 kDa in apparent size) were also enriched within captured BMF. When a series of inhibitors against different protease classes were screened, serine protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride HCl (AEBSF) was the only one that completely blocked mineral nucleation within BMF in UMR cultures. AEBSF appeared to act on an osteoblast-derived protease at a late differentiation stage in this culture model just prior to mineral deposition. Similarly, mineralization of bone nodules in primary mouse calvarial osteoblastic cultures was completely blocked by AEBSF. Cleavage of BAG-75 and BSP was also inhibited at the minimum dosage of AEBSF sufficient to completely block mineralization of BMF. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE comparisons of AEBSF-treated and untreated UMR cultures showed that fragmentation/activation of a limited number of other mineralization-related proteins was also blocked. Taken together, our results indicate for the first time that cleavage of BAG-75 and BSP by an AEBSF-sensitive, osteoblast-derived serine protease is associated with mineral crystal nucleation in BMF and suggest that such proteolytic events are a permissive step for mineralization to proceed.
