Layered double hydroxides (LDH) are promising materials with applications in industry, including wastewater treatment. Consequently, great emphasis is placed on developing methods to obtain those materials at the lowest possible cost. This work investigated using magnesite, dolomite, halloysite/kaolinite and hematite as substrates for the synthesis of LDH-containing materials. All the obtained materials were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM and chemical analysis. Their specific surface area and zeta potential were determined. The results showed, that pre-treatment of raw mineral precursors is unnecessary for efficient extraction of metal ions. The co-precipitation synthesis parameters were reduced to ageing at room temperature for a short period of time (2 h) leading to a successful formation of LDH in all samples. Depending on the used substrates, the materials showed minor differences in structural properties. However, despite that, all the materials exhibited a very high affinity towards As(V) (645.2–1483.2 mmol/kg). Therefore the described synthesis approach is promising in terms of future large-scale applications of LDH in wastewater treatment.
