Background
                  Macro minerals, also known as macro elements, are minerals that are required in large amounts in the human body. Macro minerals are part of the biological structure of the human body, play an important role in metabolic processes, and participate in almost all processes that occur in the body. Macro minerals can be toxic if consumed in large quantities for an extended period.
               
                  Results
                  There is some evidence to suggest that calcium intake may be associated with a lower risk of obesity. However, the relationship between calcium and obesity is not well understood, and more research is needed to fully understand the link. Calcium has also been studied for its potential role in the development of certain types of cancer, specifically colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. There is some evidence to suggest that higher calcium intake may be associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer.
               
                  Conclusion
                  A deficiency of a macroelement refers to a lack of one or more of the essential minerals required in large amounts by humans. Macroelement deficiencies can lead to various health problems, such as anemia, osteoporosis, and muscle weakness, if not corrected. The lack of macroelements in the blood can be a cause of many chronic diseases. Hormonal changes resulting from a deficiency of macroelements have consequences that may lead to weight gain, obesity, and an increased risk of cancer in the future. It is important to maintain a balanced diet to ensure adequate intake of macro elements.
