The Laowan super-large (208 t Au) gold deposit is located in the Tongbai orogenic belt, along with a newly-discovered molybdenite deposit at its depth in the northern periphery. The gold deposit is a fault-controlled lode gold deposit featuring sulfide quartz vein-type and altered rock-type mineralization hosted within the metamorphic rocks, whereas the molybdenum deposit is a typical porphyry-type deposit. These two deposits have their respective paragenetic sequences and mineralization types without spatial overlapping in the ore field. Here, we present U–Pb dating of zircon, hydrothermal rutile, and REE phosphates, and Re–Os dating of molybdenite to constrain the relationship between the Au and Mo mineralization, and their relation to Mesozoic granitic magmatism. Textural features indicate that rutiles and associated phosphate minerals are of hydrothermal origin, generated by re-precipitation and dissolution of titanite crystals hosted in the metamorphic host rocks due to hydrothermal alteration during Au and Mo mineralization. LA-ICP-MS U–Pb dating of rutile from the auriferous altered rocks yields a 206Pb/238U age of 120.0 ± 6.7 Ma (MSWD = 1.4), consistent with the ages of the associated monazite (125.0 ± 2.4 Ma) and xenotime (126.3 ± 2.0 Ma), representing the timing of the gold mineralization, coeval with Laowan monzogranite (zircon U–Pb: 128.8 ± 0.7 Ma). Rutile from the molybdenum deposit show an older 206Pb/238U age of 141.0 ± 11 Ma (MSWD = 1.1), consistent with the molybdenite Re–Os age (141.5 ± 1.7 Ma; MSWD = 0.27) and the zircon U-Pb age (141.6 ± 0.8 Ma; MSWD = 1.5) of the Songpa porphyry. Hence, the Au and Mo mineralization in the Laowan district represent two episodic mineralization events related to the late Mesozoic granitic magmatism. Our study also suggested that multiple isotopic dating is helpful to precisely constraint the ages for complex hydrothermal deposits.
