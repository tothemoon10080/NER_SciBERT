In-Stream Analysis (ISA) systems have been installed in many mineral processing plants world-wide and Amdel systems have been operating successfully for more than 18 years. This paper discusses recent developments in ISA technology with emphasis on diversification into new applications including the dynamic environment of pilot plant operations. The modular design and ease of rapid calibration, typically within 48 hours of start-up, makes the system suited for pilot plant operations.
                  The development by the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) of a voidage ISA probe, which basically measures the aeration of slurries, means that the system can be used to monitor accurately the % ash and % solids content of coal slurries. The Coal Slurry Analysis (CSA) system provides the means of controlling the process in coal preparation plants.
                  Recently development has been completed of an instrument for on-line elemental analysis in mineral sands dry plants by using Amdel ISA instrumentation, together with a sample presentation system developed by the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC) located in Queensland. Units have been successfully tested in zircon and rutile product streams, and further applications for on-line analysis of dry concentrates and other fine materials are expected.
