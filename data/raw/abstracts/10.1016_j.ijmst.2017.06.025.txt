This paper aims to improve the accuracy and applicability of gas diffusion mathematical models from coal particles. Firstly, a new constitutive model for gas diffusion from coal particles with tri-disperse pore structure is constructed by considering the difference in characteristics between soft coal and hard coal. The analytical solution is then derived, that is, the quantitative relationship between gas diffusion rate (Qt

                     ) and diffusion time (t). The pore structure parameters of soft coal and hard coal from Juji coal mine are determined. Gas diffusion rules are numerically calculated and investigated by physical simulation methods. Lastly, the applicability of this model is verified. The results show that the homogeneous model only applies to the gas diffusion process of hard coal during the initial 10min. The calculation results from this model and the physical experimental results of soft coal and hard coal are nearly identical during the initial 30min.
