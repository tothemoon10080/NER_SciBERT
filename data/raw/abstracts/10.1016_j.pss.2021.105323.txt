Numerous occurrences of hydrated minerals (e.g., phyllosilicate, sulfate) have been found on the surface of Mars by remote sensing and in-situ exploration missions, providing strong evidence of the aqueous environment in Martian history. However, the detailed origin of these hydrated minerals is often controversial, reducing their usefulness in constraining the aqueous history of Mars. For instance, in Ophir Chasma, the origins of hydrated sulfates are debatable among hypotheses of precipitating from groundwater, paleolake, or meteoric water. In this study, we performed detailed mineralogy, morphology and stratigraphy analyses of the hydrated phases in the mineral bowl, a depression between the southern wall and mensa of Ophir Chasma, using datasets from Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM), High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) and High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC). A large number of monohydrate sulfates (MHS), polyhydrated sulfates (PHS) and some jarosite were identified in this region. Elevation of PHS-rich regions (mean elevation of −1130 ​m) is higher than those of MHS (mean value of −1401 ​m). Spectra of poly- and monohydrated sulfates mixtures were investigated in details in laboratory. Spectral features (i.e., band depth of ~1.9 ​μm, 2.1 ​μm, convexity at 2.1 ​μm and 2.4 ​μm) of sulfates mixtures changed regularly with the abundance of endmember. The linear function between the ratio of BD2100_2 to SINDEX2 and kieserite component was set up to estimate hydrated sulfates abundance. We employ the function onto CRISM data and find a coexistence of poly- and monohydrated sulfates for the formerly recognized PHS endmember, which may indicate a local dehydration/rehydration process for the sulfated minerals. Comprehensive mineralogy, topography, and stratigraphy analyses of hydrated sulfates outcrops suggest a complex formation scenario which could include surface runoff, paleolake, even aeolian erosion.
