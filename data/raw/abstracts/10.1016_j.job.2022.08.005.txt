Objective
                  To determine whether the combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and immunostaining would visualize the mineral and protein distribution in the same histological sections.
               
                  Methods
                  Paraffin sections of fixed rat hindlimbs were processed for SEM-EDX and subsequently for immunofluorescence staining.
               
                  Results
                  The localization of calcium, phosphorus, and carbon with type II collagen could be visualized in the same region of calcified growth plate cartilage on the same section.
               
                  Conclusions
                  The combination of SEM-EDX and immunostaining is effective for visualizing mineral and protein distribution in the same histological sections.
