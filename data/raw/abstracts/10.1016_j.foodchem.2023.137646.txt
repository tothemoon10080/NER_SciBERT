Stable isotopes and multi-element profiles of grapes and corresponding soils from different origins and vintages were determined by IRMS and ICP-MS, respectively. Stable isotope ratios and multi-element contents show significant differences among distinct regions and vintages. Grapes and soils were separated using δ2H and δ18O according to regions and vintages. PCA and CA results further verified that multi-element profiles were influenced by origins and vintages. In particular, δ2H, δ18O, and 21 elements in grapes were correlated with those in soil. Redundancy and Spearman analyses revealed that the BCF values were related to the longitude, latitude, altitude, precipitation, and average temperature. RF shows better performance than PLS-DA for discriminating grape origins and vintages. K, Tb, Cs, δ2H, and Co were important variables in discriminating grape origins. These findings confirm that isotopic and elemental profiles depend on the origin, vintage, and soil, establishing a promising method to discriminate grape origins and vintages.
