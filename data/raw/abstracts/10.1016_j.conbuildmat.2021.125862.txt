Sandstones are common rocks mainly composed of a framework of grains dominated by relatively weathering-resistant silicates and aluminosilicates, whereas matrix and cement minerals in general are less resistant to weathering. Sandstone in both natural and anthropogenic environments are exposed to (bio)weathering processes, causing the release of elements from minor constituents (matrix and cement minerals) and major framework minerals and resulting in the presence of an irreversible fingerprint on the mineral/rock surface. As the result of bioweathering some adverse features such as corrosion, cracking and rock fatigue occur which arises a strong concern regarding durability of sandstones in a long-term perspective. This review paper describes analytical methods applied for determining the mineralogical composition of sandstones and their alteration features, defines bioweathering process and factors attributed to it, analyzes susceptibility of sandstone minerals to dissolution, presents experimental simulations dedicated to stability assessment. This review highlights that bioweathering processes may affect durability of construction and building materials. The gaps in the experimental research are indicated and recommendations on how to fill these gaps are provided.
