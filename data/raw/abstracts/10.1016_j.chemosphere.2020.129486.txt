Oxidation of a commonly-used β-lactam pharmaceutical, cefoperazone (CFPZ), was systematically investigated by anodic oxidation (AO), AO in presence of H2O2 electro-generation (AO-H2O2) and electro-Fenton (EF) processes with an activated carbon fiber cathode from the biodegradability viewpoint. The degradation and mineralization rates increased in a sequence of AO < AO-H2O2 < EF. Even CPFZ could be efficiently degraded in EF process, achieving complete CFPZ mineralization was rather difficult. Thereby, the biodegradability of the effluent after electrochemical pretreatment was examined to test the feasibility of the combination of electrochemical and biological processes. The results suggested that compared with AO and AO-H2O2, EF process could effectively transform the non-biodegradable CFPZ into biocompatible materials with a high BOD5/COD value (0.33 after 720 min), allowing the possible biotreatment for further remediation. This behavior was relatively accorded with the average oxidation state (AOS) results, evidencing the potential of EF process in enhancing the biodegradability of CFPZ. The determination of inorganic ions revealed that N in CFPZ molecular was oxidized into NH4
                     + and NO3
                     − ions in EF process. Oxalic, succinic, oxamic, fumaric and formic acids were also formed. Besides, six aromatic by-products were qualified and a possible pathway involving hydrolysis, hydroxylation and decarboxylation during CFPZ mineralization was proposed.
