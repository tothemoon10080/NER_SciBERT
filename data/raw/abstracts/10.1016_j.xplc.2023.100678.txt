Plant mineral nutrition is essential for crop yields and human health. However, the uneven distribution of mineral elements over time and space leads to a lack or excess of available mineral elements in plants. Among the essential nutrients, calcium (Ca2+) stands out as a prominent secondÂ messenger that plays crucial roles in response to extracellular stimuli in all eukaryotes. Distinct Ca2+ signatures with unique parameters are induced by different stresses and deciphered by various Ca2+ sensors. Recent research on the participation of Ca2+ signaling in regulation of mineral elements has made great progress. In this review, we focus on the impact of Ca2+ signaling on plant mineral uptake and detoxification. Specifically, we emphasize the significance of Ca2+ signaling for regulation of plant mineral nutrition and delve into key points and novel avenues for future investigations, aiming to offer new insights into plant ion homeostasis.
