The biomineralization of pristine chitosan film without any prior surface treatment was evaluated by immersing the film in simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37Â°C for 3 weeks. The film was prepared by solvent casting method using chitosan of known degree of deacetylation (DD). The formation of the hydroxyapatite (HA) phase on the film surface after immersion was studied periodically by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) methods. The electron micrographs showed the morphology of the deposited apatite as small globules appearing uniformly throughout the films surfaces. The Ca/P ratio of the apatite was found to increase with increase in immersion time and approaching towards the stoichiometric value of the HA phase. The mineralized chitosan film could be of promising support to hard tissue regeneration.
