With the increasing demand for molybdenum, low-grade molybdate (Metal-MoO4) reserves have to be processed. However, the surfaces of molybdate minerals do not respond well to flotation in the mineral enrichment process. This study aimed to understand whether the surfaces of molybdate minerals could be sulphidised to form a new metal sulphide phase which has a good flotation response. The sulphidisation was conducted on the surfaces of powellite (CaMoO4) and wulfenite (PbMoO4), the two most common molybdate minerals and the sulphidised surfaces were investigated by Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy and Cryogenic X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. It was found that successful sulphidisation took place on the surface of wulfenite and the major sulphidisation reaction involved the reaction of lead ions originating from lead hydromolybdate with sulphide ions to form a new lead sulphide layer. However, effective sulphidisation did not take place on the surface of powellite without the formation of a new metal sulphide phase, but the addition of the sulphidiser promoted the transition of calcium hydromolybdate to calcium molybdate.
