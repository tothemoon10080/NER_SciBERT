Ibuprofen (IBU) is a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which has attracted widespread attention due to its high frequency of environmental detection, non-degradability and potential ecological risks. However, little is known about the functional characterization of the highly efficient IBU-mineralizing consortium. In this study, an IBU-mineralizing consortium C6 was obtained by continuous enrichment of the original consortium C1 accumulated the metabolite of 2-Hydroxyibuprofen (2HIBU). Methylobacter, Pseudomonas, and Dokdonella spp. were significantly enriched in the consortium C6. Streptomyces sp. had a relative abundance of about 0.01 % in the consortium C1 but extremely low (< 0.001 %) in the consortium C6. Subsequently, two IBU degraders, Streptomyces sp. D218 and Pseudomonas sp. M20 with detection of 2HIBU or not, were isolated from the consortia C1 and C6, respectively. These results imply that the degradation of IBU in the consortia C1 and C6 may be mainly mediated by key players of Streptomyces and Pseudomonas, respectively. This study showed that the composition of the core functional strains of the bacterial community structure was changed by continuous enrichment, which affected the degradation process of IBU. These findings provide new insights into our understanding of the biotransformation process of NSAIDs and provide valuable strain resources for bioremediation.
