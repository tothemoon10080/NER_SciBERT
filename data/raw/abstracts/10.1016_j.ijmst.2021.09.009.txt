Here, the influence of grinding media with different shapes on the flotation performance of spodumene and its potential mechanism from microscale insights was investigated using a single mineral flotation experiment, X-ray diffraction (XRD) test, scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS), atomic force microscope (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The flotation data indicated that under anionic/cationic (sodium oleate (NaOL)/DDA) collectors system, the rod milled spodumene has a higher floatability than ball milled ones. XRD results confirmed that rod medium makes spodumene exposed more {110} and {100} planes, while ball medium makes spodumene exposed more {010} planes. The typical anisotropic surface of spodumene makes the surface of rod milled spodumene possess more Al sites, further confirmed by SEM-EDS and XPS results. Additionally, it was found that the rod milled spodumene presents a larger value of elongation and flatness, which are parameters closely related to bubble adhesion. AFM analysis indicated that rod milled products have a rougher surface, while ball milled products have a smoother surface. Consequently, the rod medium enhanced the adsorption of NaOL/DDA on the spodumene surfaces. This work provides theoretical guidance for optimizing the separation of spodumene from the perspective of grinding.
