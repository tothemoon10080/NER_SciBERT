Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we have identified the mechanism by which chloride impacts the extraction of U(VI) by a weak base anion exchange resin from acidic sulfate solutions. The amount of chloride present affects U(VI) speciation both in the feed solutions and adsorbed by the resin, and we find three distinct U(VI) species taken up by the resin across the salinity gradient, directly corresponding to changes in levels of U(VI) extraction. These findings are integral to the effective design of mineral processing circuits incorporating seawaterâ€”a cheaper and more sustainable water source than fresh water.
