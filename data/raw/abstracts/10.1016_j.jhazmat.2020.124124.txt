Clay sand casting generates a large amount of foundry dust (FD), and the presence of coal powder in the FD makes it difficult to recycle and utilize. The landfill of the FD creates a serious environmental pollution and wastes a valuable resource. To improve the above situation, the FD was analyzed and characterized by X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA). An ultrasonic-assisted flotation process was developed for the comprehensive utilization of the FD, and the effects of ultrasonic time on the flotation performance and flotation kinetics were investigated. In addition, the two-stage flotation of the FD was conducted. Obtained results showed that the FD mainly consisted of coal powder and clay minerals, and the coal powder was covered by clay minerals. The separation efficiency of the coal powder and clay minerals can be significantly enhanced by ultrasonic pretreatment, and the optimal ultrasonic time was 30â€¯min. The flotation kinetics analysis results indicated that the first-order model with rectangular distribution was more reasonable for the data fitting of the ultrasonic-assisted flotation. Furthermore, the concentrate and tailings obtained by the two-stage flotation had achieved an acceptable result, favoring the comprehensive utilization of the FD.
