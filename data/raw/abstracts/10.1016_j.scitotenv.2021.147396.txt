Nitrate and Cr(VI) coexist in aquifers, posing a potential threat to ecological environment and public health. Iron oxide minerals (hematite and magnetite) exist ubiquitously in groundwater, which are hot spots for biogeochemical transformation. However, there is still a knowledge gap anout the effect of iron oxide minerals on bioreduction of nitrate and Cr(VI). Here we observed that iron oxide minerals can significantly improve the ability of microorganisms to simultaneously reduce nitrate and Cr(VI), the reduction rates of nitrate and Cr(VI) increased by 7.3 and 8.5 times, respectively. The addition of minerals reinforced biofilm formation and shaped microbial communities with a new dominant strain of Azoarcus. The expression levels of functional genes were also upregulated, including napA, narG, nfsA, yieF, POD, and CAT. Furthermore, nitrate and chromate reductases' activities increased by 11 and 5 folds, respectively. These results demonstrated that iron oxide minerals participated in the bio-transformation of nitrate and Cr(VI) co-contamination, alleviating oxidative stress, shaping the microbial community, and ultimately accelerating bio-transformation. These findings offer a window into the biological transformation of co-contamination in the presence of iron oxide minerals, and insights to reveal strategies for microbial detoxification and to develop promising approaches for dealing with complex pollution conditions.
