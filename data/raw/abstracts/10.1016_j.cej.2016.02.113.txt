                      processes completely oxidized and mineralized cyanide to much less noxious compounds, mainly ammonia and carbonate. Application of VUV process for chromium electroplating wastewater (68mg/L cyanide and 24mg/L Cr(VI)) showed that complete oxidation of cyanide along with 72% reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) was reached in a short reaction time of 18min. Accordingly, the homogenous VUV advanced process was found to be an efficient chemical-less method appropriate for simultaneous oxidation of cyanide and reduction of Cr(VI) in industrial wastewater.
