The study was conducted in Eastern Amhara, Ethiopia to evaluate honey's physicochemical properties, minerals, and heavy metal contents. Forty-five honey samples were collected at the farm gates of the selected districts ad agroecologies and taken to the laboratory. The samples were analyzed following the national and international procedures of honey quality analysis. The results indicated a moisture content of (16.9 ± 1.8 g/100 g), ash (0.12 ± 0.12 g/100 g), pH (3.59 ± 0.23), electrical conductivity (EC) (0.23 ± 0.07 mS/cm), free acidity (FA) (21.8 ± 5.8 meq/kg), HMF (7.88 ± 3 mg/kg), specific rotation (− 7.92 ± 1.2), reducing sugar (66.6 ± 2.3 %), sucrose (3.49 ± 0.7 g/100 g) and caloric value (1555 ± 139 kJ/100 g) respectively. There was (p < 0.05) difference in FA and HMF between districts and pH between agroecology. The honey color varies from white (26.7 %), extra light amber (48.9 %), light amber (17.8 %), to amber (6.7 %). The mineral and heavy metal levels in the honey samples had Iron (0.56–18.69 mg/kg), copper (< 0.1–0.15 mg/kg), zinc (< 0.1–2.18 mg/kg), lead (< 0.1 mg/kg), phosphorus (9.67–301.48 mg/kg) and sulfur (0–37.24 mg/kg). Generally, the honey quality parameters fall under the acceptable national and international standards limit. We conclude that honey quality differs based on geographical and environmental factors in the study areas.
