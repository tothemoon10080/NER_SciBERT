The mechanism of high dynamic conductivity of disordered carbon in shungite determines high shielding properties of shungite materials in the microwave range is analyzed. We presented an algorithm for calculating such conducting characteristics of disordered carbon as local conductivity of these regions and conductivity of a bulk sample from the measured reflection coefficient of microwave waves. Anomalously high local dynamic conductivity was found at medium and low carbon content in the samples. We showed that the mechanism of intragranular currents, due to the high local dynamic conductivity of isolated regions of carbon, played a key role in the reflection and conductivity of shungites, when the sizes of the conducting sections were many times smaller than the sizes of the non-conducting regions. We presented the key role of ordering the carbon structure on contacts with minerals for increasing local conductivity.
