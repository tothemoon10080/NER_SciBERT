A transition towards a low carbon economy is based on increased installation and uptake of renewable energy. Renewable energy technologies depend on critical minerals for raw materials, which are distributed and produced in select jurisdictions. To meet their energy transition targets, countries need affordable and sustainable access to critical minerals making trade inevitable. However, the discourse on the legal regime for international trade has paid little emphasis on minerals and energy transition, except in the WTO raw materials and rare earths disputes. This paper reviews the overall legal regime for ownership and trade in minerals and the key aspects and challenges in light of the growing demand for critical minerals for energy transition.
