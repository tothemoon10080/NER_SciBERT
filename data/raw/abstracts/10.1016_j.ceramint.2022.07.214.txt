Herein, Factsage software and sintering experiment were conducted to predict and correlate thermodynamic calculations of Fe in a synthetic solid waste and the expansion behavior of ceramsite. With the increase of Fe2O3 content, the liquid phase content and viscosity in the multi-component system gradually decreased and the melting temperature range became wider. This can match with the generation of the liquid phase with proper viscosity in the ceramsite and the full expansion properties. At 400–1000 °C, iron as a network former was tetrahedrally coordinated with oxygen to form Hercynite (Al2FeO4) phase; at 1180–1200 °C, iron as a network modifier dissolved into the silicate mineral structure to form the eutectic composition of Diopside (Ca4Mg3.62Fe0.78Si7.6O24) and Ferrosolite (Si16Mg5.09Fe10.66Ca0.26O48). The formation of iron-bearing silicate facilitated the generation of the viscous layer, so that the outer layer of the ceramsite exhibited sealing performance. Finally, a preferable porous ceramsite with compressive strength of 10.7 MPa and an apparent density of 708 kg/m3 was obtained. This study analyzes the effect of Fe2O3 on the expansion behavior of porous ceramsite and provides new insight into how to analyze different solid wastes to produce ceramsite in a predictable way.
