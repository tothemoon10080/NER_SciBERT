Multicellular bacterial communities, known as biofilms, have been thought to be held together solely by a self-produced organic extracellular matrix (ECM). However, new evidence for a missed mineral constituent of ECM in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species, is accumulating. Study of two phylogenetically distinct bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Mycobacterium smegmatis, identified a novel mechanism crucial for proper biofilm development and architecture â€“ an active, genetically regulated, production of crystalline calcite. The calcite scaffolds stabilize bacterial biofilms, limit penetration of small molecule solutes such as antibiotics and play a conserved role in the assembly of those complex differentiated multicellular communities. This review discusses the recently discovered structural and functional roles of extracellular minerals in biofilms. It is proposed that it is time for a more complete view of the ECM as a complex combination of organic and nonorganic materials, especially in the light of the possible implications for treatment of biofilm infections.
