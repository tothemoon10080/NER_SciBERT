Since the nuclear waste releases heat during the decay process, the mechanical behaviors of granites adjacent to the nuclear waste repository are inevitably impacted by the discrepancies in the thermal expansion characteristics of composite minerals. In this study, a mesostructure-based model (MSBM) was first proposed to characterize the thermal behaviors of varying minerals and cementation interfaces with consideration of the aperture-dependent weakening effects of pre-existing micro-cracks on mineral properties. Based on the MSBM, nine sets of numerical models with different mineral compositions were generated to explore the relationship between the mineral composition and the macro mechanical behaviors of granite at the temperatures of 25–250 °C. The meso-mechanisms behind the varied macro mechanical behaviors were comprehensively analyzed. The results indicate that the macro mechanical properties, i.e., the uniaxial compressive stress (UCS) and elastic modulus (E) are dependent on the combined effects of the different thermal expansion characteristics of minerals and the different thermoelastic behaviors of the crystalline interfaces, especially the quartz-biotite and quartz-feldspar mineral boundaries. Finally, an evaluation system aiming to quantify the effects of mineral composition and temperature on the mechanical behaviors of granite was proposed. Principal minerals such as quartz and feldspar strongly influence the UCS and E of the rock at different temperatures, and the influence of feldspar on UCS becomes more pronounced with increasing the temperature. Biotite has little influence on the change in elastic modulus with temperature, while the contribution of biotite to UCS varies with the temperature.
