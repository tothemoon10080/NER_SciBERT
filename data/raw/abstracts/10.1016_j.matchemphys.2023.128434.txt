Attracted by the high theoretical capacity, metal-sulfides have been devoted to plenty of attentions. But they still suffer from the complex preparing process and high cost. Natural sulphide ores have been deemed as the promising energy-storage materials with great electrochemical properties and low cost. However, they are limited by serious volume swelling and the shutting of polysulfides. Herein, supported by the vacuum gasification manners, natural stibnite is successfully complexed with series of silicate-minerals. Among them, for the as-fabricated Sb2S3@diatomite(Sb2S3@DT), the increasing contacting area of electrolyte with active materials could be obtained, accompanying with the formation of Sb-O bonds on the surface, resulting in the effective chemical limitation of by-product. Moreover, the natural designing of pores serves as important roles in physical confinement effect. As expect, Sb2S3@DT samples display a capacity of 779.4 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, which could be remained about 623.6 mAh g−1 even after 500 cycles. Assisted by the detailed kinetic analysis, the improved diffusion rate and surface/near-surface controlling behaviors could be further enhanced. From the results of in-situ EIS, the reversible solid electrolyte interphase could be found. The work is anticipated to shed light on the effective strategies about designing advanced mineral-based anodes.
