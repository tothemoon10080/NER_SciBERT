                      is injected into storage reservoirs, buoyancy drives flow upward towards overlying caprock layers that retard flow. Caprocks are commonly shale formations with extremely low pore connectivity, but they contain a large amount of nanopores (pore width

                      200Â nm). Nanopores with large surface area can potentially adsorb and store any CO

The goal of this study is to determine the extent to which mineral attributes affect CO

We use pure clay samples and 55 shale samples that are from Bakken, Wolfcamp, Utica, Niobrara, and Green River formations in the US, and from Agardhfjellet and Rurikfjellet formations in Svalbard. We show that organic matter and clay groups are the primary drivers of CO

                      adsorption increases with thermal maturation of both organic matter and clay minerals. Inorganic minerals, such as carbonate, quartz, K-feldspar, plagioclase and pyrite, are non-sorbing minerals that have an inverse relation to CO
