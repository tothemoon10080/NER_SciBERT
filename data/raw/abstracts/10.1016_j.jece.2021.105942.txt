Environmental pollution caused by heavy metals attracts increasing attention due to the carcinogenic and mutagenic effects. Sulfide minerals-based Cr(VI) reduction was an economical and efficient strategy for chromium remediation. However, the passivation effect limited its broad application. In this study, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, a type of mineral decomposer, mediated Cr(VI) reduction and Cr(III) coprecipitation behavior through oxidization of the pyrite and/or pyrrhotite were systematically investigated. Sulfide minerals dissolution and Cr(VI) reduction/coprecipitation performance were highly dependent on the acid solubility of the minerals. Pyrite mainly facilitated Cr(VI) reduction, while pyrrhotite promoted Cr(III) coprecipitation. A. ferrooxidans promoted sulfide minerals dissolution and secondary iron mineral formation, thereby enhanced Cr(III) removal. Moreover, sulfide mineral dissolution was intensified by light illumination. Pore-shell structure iron minerals formed when oxalic acid was added, which relieved the passivation effect. Synergistic effect in Cr(VI) reduction was achieved between sulfide minerals and A. ferrooxidans. This research is of environmental and practical significance to solve redox-sensitive pollution based on the synergistic effect between sulfide minerals and chemoautotrophic A. ferrooxidans.
