A suite of computer models which simulate process operations in common use in the minerals processing industry is being developed. Application of the models is described with reference to a particular process device, the spiral concentrator. The paper sets out to explain the basic strategy behind the unit process modelling approach and discusses in detail the overall model structure adopted. The model aims to provide a set of equations, with sufficient physical significance to give a reasonable fit to any specific data set, and which can be systematically adjusted (through auxiliary models, user judgement and experience) to provide meaningful performance predictions over a broad range of operating conditions. The approach is thought to be applicable to a wide variety of processes. The model has been tested using a variety of ores, separated on plant-scale equipment and practical examples are given. The scope and limitations of the method are reported, drawing on the results of parallel experimental work. The extent to which this kind of approach can be used as a predictive tool in process design applications and in the day-to-day running of mineral processing plant is discussed.
