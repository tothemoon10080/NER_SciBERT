A powerful pretreatment technique, ultrasound-assisted dispersive liquid-phase microextraction (USA-DLPME) based on dl-Carnitine-based deep eutectic solvent (DES), has been developed to efficiently enrichment of bisphenol A from mineral water samples. The DES-based USA-DLPME technique demonstrated superior extraction efficiency for bisphenol A compared to established organic solvent-based liquid-liquid extraction techniques. The conditions for the extraction of bisphenol A were predicted using the response surface methodology. The effects of pH (A: 2–10), NaCl concentration (B: 0.2–1.0%w/v), DES volume (C: 30–150 μL), and sonication time (D: 1–5 min) were examined using an experimental design. The extraction recovery of Bisphenol A under optimum conditions was achieved at 99.897% (A = 8, B = 0.4%w/v, C = 120 μL, and D = 5 min). Under these conditions, a wide linear range of 1–600 ng mL−1, an enrichment factor of 81.52, a low detection limit of 0.26 ng mL−1 and a limit of quantification of 0.87 ng mL−1 were obtained. Lastly, the proposed technique was used to accurately and reliably identify bisphenol A in various mineral water samples, yielding relative recoveries in the 92–96% range with RSD≤3%. These findings imply that DESs can be widely and successfully used to extract chemicals from actual materials. DESs are a class of innovative green solvents with the potential to replace organic solvents.
