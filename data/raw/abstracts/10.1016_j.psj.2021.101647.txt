This study was designed to evaluate effects of source of macro and trace minerals (inorganic vs. organic) in fast and slower growing broiler breeders’ diets on egg and hatchling mineral content and on offspring tibia morphological, biophysical, and mechanical characteristics. After 10 wk feeding the breeders (at 30 wk of age), eggs were collected and incubated. Eggs and hatchlings were analysed on mineral content. Male chickens were assigned to 32 pens with 12 chickens per pen. At approximately 1,700 and 2,600 gram BW, three chickens per pen were slaughtered. Tibia characteristics were determined. Organic minerals in the broiler breeder diet resulted in higher Fe and Se concentration in the egg and in higher Se concentration in the hatchling. Despite effects of mineral source on mineral concentration in the eggs and hatchlings were limited, organic minerals in the slower-growing broiler breeder diet resulted in higher offspring BW (d 42, Δ = 115 g; P = 0.03) and advanced tibia development (higher thickness (∆ = 0.38 cm; P < 0.001), osseous volume (∆ = 5.1 cm3; P = 0.01), and mineral density (Δ = 0.13 g/cm3; P = 0.03) at 2,600 g BW), but this was not observed in fast-growing chickens. This suggests that 1) the difference in feed intake of the breeders between strains might affect offspring performance, which might indicate that current slower-growing breeder diets might be suboptimal in minerals or that transgenerational mineral availability in slower growing chickens appears to be more effective on bone development, which might be related to time available for bone development. 2) transgenerational mineral availability in offspring appears to play a role via other mechanisms than via absolute mineral concentrations.
