Samples of five types of coal and oil shale from the Daqing region have been subjected to co-pyrolysis in different blending ratios with thermo-gravimetry (TG), given a heating rate of 30°C/min to a final temperature of 900°C. Investigations on pyrolysis of mixing coal and oil shale in different proportions were carried out, indicating that the main scope of weight loss corresponding to hydrocarbon oil and gas release was between 350 and 550°C. At higher temperatures, significant weight loss was attributed to coke decomposition. Characteristic pyrolysis parameters of blends from oil shale and the high ranked XZ coal varied with the blending ratio, but oil shale dominated the process. At the same blending proportions, highly volatile medium and low ranked coal of low moisture and ash content reacted well during pyrolysis and could easily create synergies with oil shale. Medium and high ranked coal with high moisture content played a negative role in co-pyrolysis.
