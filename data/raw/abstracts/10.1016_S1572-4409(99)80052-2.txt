Two leaching systems have been investigated to recover copper from a mixed atacamite, secondary copper sulphides mineral: heap leaching and BRISA process. The mineral contains 3.13% Cu, 0.32% C1, a copper as sulphide/copper as oxide ratio of 1.75, and a composition of the different particle size fractions quite close to each other. The treatment of this mineral by heap leaching with acid salt water (current practice) would yield 50% of copper recovery. This leaching system fails to recover the copper present as sulphide. The reason for this is the presence of chloride ions in the medium (coming from the acid leaching of atacamite) that hinders the bioleaching of copper sulphides. In order to solve this problem a two-stage leaching system has been tested, the first stage with acid salt water and the second stage with ferric sulphate (which is biologically regenerated) as leaching agents. The technical feasibility of the two-stage leaching has been proved and the optimum operating conditions have been determined. On the other hand, plugging of heaps caused by breaking of pellets leads to lack of solution contact with particles and oxygen supply for bacterial growth. The separation of the fine fraction (<3.2 mm) that amounts to 44.8% of the mineral weight, and its treatment by dynamic leaching following the BRISA process, can solve this problem, leading to very high copper recoveries for a short treatment time (of the order of several hours). The ferrous iron in leaching liquors can be effectively biooxidized in biofilm reactors provided that the sodium chloride concentration is less than 4 g/1. Three treatment options are presented with technical and economic results. All of the options yield improved copper recoveries in comparison with the one-stage heap leaching with acid salt water treatment (58%, 72% and 82% Cu against 46% Cu), without a very significant increase in the production cost.
