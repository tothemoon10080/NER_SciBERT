As a global public health focus, oral health plays a vital role in facilitating overall health. Defected teeth characterized by exposure of dentin generally increase the risk of aggravating oral diseases. The exposed dentinal tubules provide channels for irritants and bacterial invasion, leading to dentin hypersensitivity and even pulp inflammation. Cariogenic bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on dentin are responsible for tooth demineralization and caries. It remains a clinical challenge to achieve the integration of tubule occlusion, collagen mineralization, and antibiofilm functions for managing exposed dentin. To address this issue, an epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and poly(allylamine)-stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate (PAH-ACP) co-delivery hollow mesoporous silica (HMS) nanosystem (E/PA@HMS) was herein developed. The application of E/PA@HMS effectively occluded the dentinal tubules with acid- and abrasion-resistant stability and inhibited the biofilm formation of Streptococcus mutans. Intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen fibrils and remineralization of demineralized dentin were induced by E/PA@HMS. The odontogenic differentiation and mineralization of dental pulp cells with high biocompatibility were also promoted. Animal experiments showed that E/PA@HMS durably sealed the tubules and inhibited biofilm growth up to 14 days. Thus, the development of the E/PA@HMS nanosystem provides promising benefits for protecting exposed dentin through the coordinated manipulation of dentin caries and hypersensitivity.
