The application of the proton-induced X-ray emission method in combination with a proton microprobe (micro-PIXE) to studies of the mineralization process in selected organic matrices is presented. The flat-bone mineralization of the skull of 17â€“19 days pregnancy mouse embryos is described in detail. The section thickness as well as concentrations of P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Zn and Br were determined using the raster- or line-scan irradiation mode. On the basis of Ca and P contents the amount of inorganic phase was determined for each sample under investigation, while the Ca/P ratio was used for the identification of the chemical compounds within inorganic material. In the embryonal bones we observed almost stoichiometric hydroxyapatite; however, in the intramembranaceous ossification of the young (17 day) animals, octacalcium phosphate was identified. At the given age of the embryo the amount of minerals is much higher in the femur bone than in flat bone. The micro-PIXE method furthermore turned out to be sensitive enough to study the mineralization accompanying malignant tumors. We have also observed the involvement of some trace elements in the development of the mineralization process. The last two observations are unattainable by histological staining.
