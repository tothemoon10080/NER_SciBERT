Owing to its environmental-friendliness, low-cost, and outstanding characteristics, biochar has been widely used for the catalytic degradation of various organic pollutants. In this study, a pre- and post-deashing graphitized biochar (DBC800 and PBC800-A) was prepared and compared with the pristine biochar (PBC800) to activate persulfate (PS) for tetracycline (TC) degradation. The influence of the natural endogenous mineral on the catalytic ability of biochar was investigated. Characterization results show that the inherent endogenous mineral in biochar not only acted as a natural pore-forming agent to promote the formation of the porous structure, but also facilitated the formation of edge defective structures, and altered the surface functional groups, as well as increased the carbonization and graphitization degree of biochar. The PBC800-A exhibited a much higher catalytic efficiency on PS activation and TC oxidative degradation with the reaction rate of 0.06055 min−1, 7.14 times as that of DBC800 (0.00861 min−1) and 4.63 times as that of PBC800 (0.00158 min−1). The endogenous minerals were conducive to the generation of free radicals and promoted the oxidative degradation of TC, which was mainly attributed to the improved carbon configuration. The post-deashing treatment was also found to significantly improve the electron transport efficiency of biochar by removing the residual ash, thereby promoting the generation of singlet oxygen. This study demonstrated that the natural minerals in biochar was beneficial for the degradation of TC, and more alternative natural minerals can be applied to co-pyrolysis with biochar for the remediation of refractory organic pollutants.
