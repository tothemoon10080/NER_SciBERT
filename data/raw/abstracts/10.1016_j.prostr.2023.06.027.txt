Fracture toughness (FT) is one of the parameters that characterise the tendency of materials to crack and fracture. FT is usable for individual materials (such as metals, concrete, and composites) and the interfaces between them. FT of interfaces between different rocks or minerals is also of interest when assessing the stability of rock masses in mining. The novelty of this work is due to the FT of interfaces between rocks of various types. Standardized techniques exist for metals, concrete, and composite materials. For rock, the investigation uses the methodology recommended by the International Society of Rock Mechanics (ISRM). The article contains the FT values for gypsum stone, flint, as well as for the interfaces between them, which also include interlayers of carbonaceous clays.
