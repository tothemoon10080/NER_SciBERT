Composite concrete barriers represent a good alternative to current landfill containment systems because they can be made using waste minerals and thus have a lower environmental and economic cost. They are also more robust when in place. This paper presents results from laboratory testing and site trials and modelling of a concrete barrier system. Laboratory trials to determine the effect of cracking on the composite barrier are also reported. It is concluded that cracking will not cause failure. The modelling of the transport processes provided a good prediction of the movement of some species in the site trials.
