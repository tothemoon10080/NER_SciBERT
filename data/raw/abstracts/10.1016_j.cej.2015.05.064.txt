Carbon dioxide (CO2) mineral sequestration technologies are potentially capable of sequestering billion tonnes of CO2 annually. In recent years, pH swing mineral carbonation has received significant attention due to its high potentiality toward CO2 fixation. This review compiles the work conducted by various researchers over the last few years on pH swing mineral carbonation process. In this review, feedstocks used for pH swing process are introduced. The extraction and carbonation steps, as the main steps of pH swing process are critically reviewed. The role of reaction condition on extraction efficiency of calcium and magnesium from feedstocks and the kinetics involved in extraction step are also critically reviewed. The experimental procedures of pH swing and in situ pH swing mineral carbonation using different minerals and industrial wastes are critically discussed. Moreover, the drawbacks of each pH swing process in terms of cost and energy analysis are also discussed in this review.
