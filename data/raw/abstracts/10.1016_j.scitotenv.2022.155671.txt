It is widely thought that organo-mineral complexes (OMCs) stabilize organic matter via mineral adsorption. Recent studies have demonstrated that root exudates can activate OMCs, but the influence of OMCs on plant rhizosphere, which is among the most active areas for microbes, has not been thoroughly researched. In this study, a pot experiment using Brassica napus was conducted to investigate the effects of OMCs on plant rhizosphere. The result showed that OMC addition significantly promoted the growth of B. napus compared to the prevalent fertilization (PF, chemical fertilizer + chicken compost) treatment. Specifically, OMC addition increased the relative abundance (RA) of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and the bacterial Î±-diversity, and the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) group with RA > 0.5% in the OMC-treated rhizosphere was the result of a deterministic assembly process with homogeneous selection. Gene abundance related to nitrogen cycling and the soil chemical analysis demonstrated that the OMC-altered bacterial community induced nitrogen fixation and converted nitrate to ammonium. The upregulated carbon sequestration pathway genes and the increased soil microbial biomass carbon (23.68%) demonstrated that the bacterial-induced carbon storage in the rhizosphere was activated. This study shows that the addition of OMCs can influence the biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycling via regulating microorganisms in the rhizosphere. The findings provide fresh insights into the effects of OMCs on the biogeochemical cycling of important elements and suggest a promising strategy for improving soil productivity.
