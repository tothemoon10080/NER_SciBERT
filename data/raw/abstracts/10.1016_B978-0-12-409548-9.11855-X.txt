Clay minerals are a diverse group of hydrous layer aluminosilicates that constitute the greater part of the phyllosilicate family of minerals. They are commonly defined by geologists as hydrous layer aluminosilicates with a particle size <2μm, while engineers and soil scientists define clay as any mineral particle <4μm. However, clay minerals are commonly >2μm, or even 4μm in at least one dimension. Their small size and large ratio of surface area to volume gives clay minerals a set of unique properties, including high cation exchange capacities, catalytic properties, and plastic behavior when moist.
