Six pearl millet genotypes were used in this study: IS 91333, IS 91666, and IS 89111 for dough fermentation and IS 880004, IS 91777 and YD-X3 genotypes for Damirga flour. Investigation showed that traditional fermentation for 14 h at 37 °C caused a decline in pH with time; a sharp drop was observed at the beginning, which gradually levelled off. Fermentation resulted in significant reduction of starch and phytic acid: 9.5–9.8% and 43–44%, respectively. Protein content was not affected. The Damirga process significantly elevated starch content (by 8–19%) but significantly reduced the protein and phytic acid contents (by 10.9–12.1 and 86–93%, respectively). Damirga flour was found to retain 25–84% of the major minerals (Ca, Mg, P, K and Na) and 52–65% of the minor minerals (Zn, Mn and Fe); losses occurred for all minerals except Cu.
