Under the condition of ultrasonic wave heating, the ground oil sand from Daqing oilfield was preprocessed with compound modification reagent. In order to separate oil and sand, flotation machine is used and orthogonal test is carried out to optimize the process conditions. The test results show that under the conditions of modification reagent concentration of 10.0g/L, ultrasonic wave intensity of 53kHz, power of 75kW, temperature of 50Â°C and duration of 10min, the Daqing ground oil sand with the initial oil content of 30.80% can be transformed into dry sludge with a sharply reduced residual oil content of 0.66% after being preprocessed with ultrasonic wave and separated by flotation machine. The solid particle size compositions and major components were analyzed with a laser particle size analyzer and X-ray analyzer (LS-100Q), and GC-MS as well as FITR were adopted to analyze the oil phase. The mechanism of action of intensifying separation of oil sand with the effect of ultrasonic wave was analyzed.
