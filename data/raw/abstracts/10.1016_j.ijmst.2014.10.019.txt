In view of the buckling failure caused by large deformation of Mesozoic soft rock roadway in Shajihai mining area, such as serious roof fall, rib spalling, floor heave, etc., based on the detail site investigation, theoretical analysis, mineral composition test, microstructure test, water-physical property test and field experiments were carried out. And we revealed the compound failure mechanism of Mesozoic soft rock roadway in Shajihai mining area, namely the molecule expansion-shear slip of weak structural plane-construction disturbance. On this basis, the coupling support technology whose core is constant resistance with large deformation bolt was proposed. The feature of this supporting technology is that a new type of structural composite material was used, which makes the supporting system not only has the ideal deformation characteristics, but also has high supporting resistance. Thus the fully release of plastic energy within surrounding rock and reasonable control of the thickness of the plastic ring were realized. Then the differential deformation between the surrounding rock and support was eliminated by the secondary coupling support of bolt–mesh–cable, and the bolt with high strength was applied in the base angle to control floor. Eventually the collaborative bearing system of surrounding rock–support was formed. Through field tests the validity and rationality of support was also verified.
