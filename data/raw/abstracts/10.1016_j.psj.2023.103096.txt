Efforts to achieve sustainable phosphorus (P) inputs in broiler farming which meet the physiological demand of animals include nutritional intervention strategies that have the potential to modulate and utilize endogenous and microbiota-associated capacities. A temporal P conditioning strategy in broiler nutrition is promising as it induces endocrinal and transcriptional responses to maintain mineral homeostasis. In this context, the current study aims to evaluate the composition of the jejunal microbiota as a functional entity located at the main absorption site involved in nutrient metabolism. Starting from a medium or high P supply in the first weeks of life of broilers, a depletion strategy was applied at growth intervals from d 17 to 24 and d 25 to 37 to investigate the consequences on the composition of the jejunal microbiota. The results on fecal mineral P, calcium (Ca), and phytate contents showed that the diets applied to the depleted and non-depleted cohorts were effective. Microbial diversity in jejunum was represented by alpha diversity indices which appeared unaffected between dietary groups. However, chickens assigned to the dietary P depletion groups showed significantly higher abundances of Facklamia, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae compared to non-depleted control groups. Based on current knowledge of microbial function, these microorganisms make only a minor contribution to the birds' adaptive mechanism in the jejunum following P depletion. Microbial taxa such as Brevibacterium, Brachybacterium, and genera of the Staphylococcaceae family proliferated in a P-enriched environment and might be considered biomarkers for excessive P supply in commercial broiler chickens.
