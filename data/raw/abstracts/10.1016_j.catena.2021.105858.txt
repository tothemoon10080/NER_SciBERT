How to reduce the rising carbon (C) in the atmosphere by enhancing forest soil C-holding capacity requires further research. Forest density via thinning has long been studied for this reason. However, how changes in density affect soil C sequestration is still uncertain for many other factors also affect soil C in open forest ecosystems. To measure the effect of thinning on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock relative to other contributing factors, we selected 12 25 × 25 m plots, and applied a series of thinning treatments: CK (control plots; 2173 ± 12 trees ha−1, which was how all plots started), LT (light thinning; 1834 ± 12 trees ha−1), MT (moderate thinning; 1418 ± 7 trees ha−1) and HT (heavy thinning; 1089 ± 13 trees ha−1). We measured the SOC stocks (kg C m−2) for 11 seasons crossing three years. In addition, soils of the four treatment plots (0–50 cm soil depth, 5 layers, 10 cm per layer) were collected once per season, and then the samples were incubated for 56 days before measuring their cumulate mineralized carbon (CMC). The temperature at 10 cm underground was measured every 60 min throughout two years. The active carbon (DOC (dissolved organic C) and MBC (microbial biomass C)) stocks were also measured. We found that soil in MT plots held more C overall, with more active carbon per unit of SOC. Soil temperatures were affected by the thinning as well as the C and N (nitrogen) stock. Soil temperatures and C, N stock alike rose from CK levels and peaked in MT, before decreasing in HT. However, SOC mineralization rate (mineralized-C) was reduced in MT across seasons, and mineralized-C varied seasonally. Soil C and N stocks were enhanced in MT plots, partly due to the increased soil temperatures and the reduced mineralized-C.
