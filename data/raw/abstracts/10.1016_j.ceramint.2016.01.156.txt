The phase and morphological evolutions during carbothermal reduction nitridation (CRN) process were comparatively investigated using three kinds of raw material (slag, glass and minerals) providing different Si and Al sources. The results showed that the CRN processes using different raw materials presented the same phase transformation steps. In SiAlON family, O-SiAlON was firstly formed then transformed to nitrogen-rich SiAlONs, including β-, α-SiAlON and 15R polytypoid with the increase of temperature or holding time. At the end of CRN, β and 15R were converted to α-SiAlON. In addition, gehlenite phase was also formed at the initial stage of CRN, which could be further converted to SiAlON in the presence of reductant C. The morphology of nitridation specimens was highly dependent on the liquid or gas phases formed via CRN reactions, which contributed to the formation of prismatic, hollow spherical and needle-like SiAlON powders via three CRN processes.
