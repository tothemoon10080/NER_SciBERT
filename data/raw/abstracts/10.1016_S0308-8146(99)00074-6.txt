The effect of fermentation, germination and heating on the levels of thiamine, riboflavin and some mineral elements was studied in Sudanese kisra bread and hulu-mur drink prepared from the two sorghum cultivars dabar and fetarita, consecutively. Fermentation of kisra increased riboflavin but decreased thiamine significantly (p<0.01), whereas fermentation of hulu-mur reduced the levels of both vitamins significantly (p<0.01). Germination of fetarita grains for 6 days caused a significant (p<0.01) increase of riboflavin (700%) and a significant (p<0.01) reduction of thiamine (42%). Riboflavin was not affected by baking of kisra and thiamine level was slightly reduced. Hulu-mur baking caused significant (p<0.01) reduction of both thiamine and riboflavin. Fermentation caused no significant effect (p<0.01) on the mineral contents of kisra or hulu-mur. Addition of spices to hulu-mur dough caused significant increases (p<0.01) of strontium (80%), calcium (60%) and iron (35%). Germination of fetarita grains caused significant increases (p<0.01) of zinc (90%), lead (65%) and molybdenum (58%). Baking of kisra and hulu-mur did not cause any significant loss (p<0.01) in the contents of minerals.
