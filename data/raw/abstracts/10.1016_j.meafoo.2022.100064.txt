This work evaluated the in vitro bioaccessibility of ascorbic acid, total phenolic, carotenoids, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn in the peel and pulp of Buchenavia tomentosa Eichler (mirindiba) and their antioxidant capacities. Ascorbic acid, total phenolic and antioxidant capacity were quantified by the Tillmans, Folin–Ciocalteu and DPPH methods. Carotenoids were quantified by UV–vis spectrophotometry and minerals by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Ascorbic acid concentrations in the pulp and peel were 4911.96 and 1987.99 mg 100 g−1 with in vitro bioaccessibilities of 3.94 and 8.18%. Total phenolic concentrations in the pulp and peel were 2134.47 and 3519.07 mg GAE 100 g−1 with in vitro bioaccessibilities of 38.33 and 26.13%, respectively. Concentrations of α-carotene, β-carotene, and lycopene were 11.77, 12.72 and 9.06 µg g−1 in the pulp and 14.06, 15.03, and 10.05 µg g−1 in the peel, having in vitro bioaccessibilities of 53.80, 26.77 and 29.00% and 21.56, 23.28 and 24.93%. The antioxidant capacities of the pulp and peel were 325.59 and 283.59 *EC50 g/g DPPH. Mineral concentrations were below the limit of quantification. The results suggest that mirindiba can be a natural source of bioaccessible bioactive compounds and income for the Cerrado communities.
