The banded iron formations which are hosted in the greenstone belts of Dharwar Craton are potential sources of iron and also major archives of gold mineralization at some places. The gold bearing banded sulphidic cherts from the Neoarchean Sandur greenstone belt of western Dharwar Craton have been reported in this paper in order to understand their geochemical characteristics, source of gold mineralization and depositional conditions. These rocks are predominantly characterized as mixed oxide-sulphide facies which are generally referred as sulphide facies iron formations, consisting of alternate mesoscale bands of silica and iron with sulphides such as pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, arsenopyrite and sphalerite occurring as minor opaque phases. Mineral chemical analyses of pyrite having high Fe/(S + As), Co/Ni and Pb/As ratios suggests hydrothermal source. Native gold occurs as disseminations in these sulphides with its concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 1.48 ppm. Gold mineralization is sediment hosted variety, epigenetic, epithermal-hydrothermal in origin, where the sulphidic-auriferous fluids generated at Mid oceanic ridge (MOR)-hydrothermal system were transported and deposited in an oxygen-deficient environment. Low CaO, MgO, K2O and ƩREE contents suggests minor detrital input while La-Th-Sc relationship indicate minor volcaniclastic source from metabasic rocks. Low K/Rb and Th/U illustrate negligible effects of weathering in these samples. Geochemical proxies such as superchondritic Y/Ho ratios along with Post Archean Australian Shale (PAAS) and Mud from Queensland (MUQ) normalized REE + Y patterns with depleted LREE and positive Eu, La and Y anomalies suggest that these BIFs were generated by the chemical precipitation of iron and silica in sea water at MOR and continental margin setting which had suboxic to anoxic paleo-redox conditions.
