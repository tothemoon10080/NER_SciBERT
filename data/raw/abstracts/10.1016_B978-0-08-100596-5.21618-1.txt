Minerals including major and trace elements have vital roles and diverse functions for our body. Deficiency and excessive intake of these micronutrients can lead to the numerous diseases and disorders. Therefore, having enough knowledge about their recommended dietary allowance is essential. Furthermore, a variation in mineral bioavailability is related to the different conditions both in the food during the process and in the body. Despite the positive effects of food processing on mineral bioavailability, a variety of techniques, including autoclaving, baking, canning, debittering, microwave cooking, pressure cooking, soaking, and so on, can significantly decrease the mineral content of food products and their absorption within the human body. To avoid these effects, the enrichment of foods with minerals is a good solution used for calcium, magnesium, selenium, and zinc. Another strategy is micro/nanoencapsulation of these bioactive compounds as a method of fortification, which improves the stability of minerals during processing and storage, increases their bioavailability, and also can mask the off-flavor and off-color of food products resulting in higher acceptability for final product consumption.
