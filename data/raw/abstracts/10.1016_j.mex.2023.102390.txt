In this contribution we present a method for pre-screening geological materials for zircon prior to submitting samples for heavy mineral separation. The proposed workflow utilizes micro X-ray fluorescence to identify zirconium-bearing pixels in slabbed rock samples. The open-source image analysis software ImageJ™ is applied to the micro X-ray fluorescence elemental map to determine the abundance and spatial distribution of zirconium-bearing pixels in the scanned surface area. This method allows for the prediction of zircon abundance and estimation of grain size within a sample which can be used to prioritize samples for geochronology as well as inform crushing and grinding metrics for heavy mineral separation. This information can ultimately lead to improved recovery of zircon and other mineral geochronometers for geochronological studies. Advantages of the proposed workflow include:
