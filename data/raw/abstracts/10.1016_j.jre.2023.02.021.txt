This study investigated the leaching of scandium from a Sc-bearing silicate ore. The Sc concentrate obtained by beneficiation pre-enrichment has 1.03 × 10−4 wt% Sc and 14.66 wt% Fe. The main Sc-bearing minerals are limonite, chlorite, sericite, and hornblende, in the form of isomorphism. High-pressure leaching (HPL) with sulfuric acid (98 wt%) and NaF was used to dispose this samples. The Sc leaching efficiency of 91.82% was obtained under the optimum conditions, which are pressure of 5.0 × 105 Pa, A/O value of 1.1, L/S value of 1.8, NaF dosage of 2 wt%, at 130 °C for 6 h. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results show that the residue is mainly quartz phase in the multi-hole shape. Compared with ordinary leaching for silicate, high-pressure leaching has significant advantages in saving acid and energy consumption.
