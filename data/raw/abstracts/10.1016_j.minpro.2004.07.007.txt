The mechanochemical treatment of the sulphidic minerals galena PbS, chalcopyrite CuFeS2 and chalcosine Cu2S with elemental Fe have been studied. Metallic Pb and Cu are produced as a result of the reducing power of iron. The kinetics of the chalcosine reduction has been followed by X-ray examination of the reaction products. The reduction processes are very fast and the ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure are sufficient for their propagation.
