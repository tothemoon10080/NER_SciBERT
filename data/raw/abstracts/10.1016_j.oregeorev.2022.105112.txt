In the porphyry Cu ± Au ± Mo deposits (PCDs), chlorite and its mineral assemblages are indicators for exploration. However, chlorite found in PCDs may have different origins because it is a common mineral in different geological environments. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the differences in the composition of PCDs-related chlorites (chloritePCDs) and chlorite formed in other geological environments (chloriteBarren). Here, based on occurrences, mineral assemblages, and compositions of the chlorites from thirty PCDs and barren areas (including geothermal systems, chloriteGSs; low-grade metamorphic rocks, chloriteLGMRs; sedimentary rocks, chloriteSRs), we used principal component analysis (PCA) and random forest (RF) methods to find discrimination approaches. Results show that chloritePCDs and chloriteBarren differ in the Fe, Mg, Al, Ti, and possibly Mn, K, and Ca elements. Based on these differences, wt.% ratios of (MgO + 100*TiO2)/(FeO + 100*CaO), TiO2/(CaO + K2O + Na2O), Al2O3/(100*K2O*CaO), MgO/(100*CaO*Na2O), SiO2/100(CaO + K2O), and FeO/100TiO2 and diagrams of Fe/(Fe + Mg) (a.p.f.u. ratio) vs TiO2/(Na2O + K2O + CaO) (wt.% ratio), Fe/(Fe + Mg) (a.p.f.u. ratio) vs MgO/(100*Na2O*CaO) (wt.% ratio), and Fe/(Fe + Mg) (a.p.f.u. ratio) vs SiO2/Al2O3 (wt.% ratio) are proposed to distinguish chloritePCDs from chloriteBarren. These discrimination approaches have better results in distinguishing chloritePCDs from chloriteLGMRs and chloriteSRs but are less effective for chloriteGSs. By comparing the physicochemical conditions, the highly oxidized conditions and high temperature of the ore-related intrusions and fluid properties result in the compositional differences between chloritePCDs and chloriteBarren. Although further researches remain to be done, this study provides potential approaches for identifying chloritePCDs based on major elements.
