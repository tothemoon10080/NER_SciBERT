Soils are the central organizer of the terrestrial ecosystem. Their colloidal and particulate constituents, be they minerals, organic matter, and microorganisms, are not separate entities; rather, they are constantly interacting with each other. Interactions of these components control biogeochemical reactions, namely, the formation of short-range-ordered metal oxides, catalysis of humic substance formation, enzymatic stability and activity, mineral transformation, aggregate turnover, biogeochemical cycling of C, N, P, and S, and the fate and transformation of organic and inorganic pollutants. Furthermore, the impacts of mineral–organic matter–microorganism interactions and associated biogeochemical reactions and processes on biodiversity, species composition, and sustainability of the terrestrial ecosystem deserve close attention for years to come. This paper integrates the frontiers of knowledge on this subject matter, which is essential to uncovering the dynamics and mechanisms of terrestrial ecosystem processes and to developing innovative management strategies to sustain ecosystem health on the global scale.
