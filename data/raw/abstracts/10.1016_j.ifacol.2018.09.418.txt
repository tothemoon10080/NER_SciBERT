As a part of the H2020 SPIRE project, Intensified by Design (IbDÂ®), mineral beneficiation process chain will be intensified in terms of more efficient usage of energy and raw materials. The work focuses on optimizing control of the grinding circuit, coarse flotation process, new solids measurements and soft-sensors, as well as adaptive dynamic mass balancing. All demonstrators are interconnected through plant-wide optimization. In this paper, the process intensification activities carried out at the mini-pilot scale mineral beneficiation plant are briefly described. The real-time adaptation strategy utilizing Differential Evolution for parameter estimation in a sliding window is presented. The initial results show a successful parameter estimation result even in a short time window.
