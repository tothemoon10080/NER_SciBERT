The photocatalytic mineralization is a well-known process that allows use of photocatalyst material for oxidation-reduction, degradation, and mineralization of contaminants under UV/visible light. The main aim of photocatalysis is the degradation of the parent contaminants, originated intermediate(s), and finally their mineralization into CO2 and H2O, NO3 etc. However, most of the literature on photocatalysis presents identification of potential photocatalyst materials with faster reaction kinetics and activity in visible light, and rare information is available on selectivity of photocatalytic reactions toward controlled degradation, mineralization, and fate of contaminants after being degraded/mineralized. This also led to rare consideration of some of the processes, i.e., adsorption, photosensitization, and partial degradation that could result in removal of contaminants different than mineralization but often misinterpreted as mineralization. Therefore, in this chapter such processes are discussed in detail to highlight their significance during fundamental investigation of photocatalysis and to distinguish such processes from actual mineralization. Further discussion is included to support the claims on the contradiction of such processes with mineralization and to differentiate for reasonable interpretation, comprised of experimental work performed on contaminant dyes and supported literature on selective phenolic compounds.
