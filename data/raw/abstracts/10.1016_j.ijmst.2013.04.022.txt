The interaction mechanism between dextrin and minerals has been investigated through micro-flotation, adsorption density measurements, Fourier transform infrared ray (FTIR) spectroscopic studies and dissolution tests. Dextrin shows a good depressing action towards galena but not chalcopyrite. FTIR spectroscopic studies indicate that dextrin chemically adsorbed on galena surface in alkaline pH range. Dissolution tests confirm leaching action of metal ions from chalcopyrite and galena surfaces, and dextrin-lead ion interaction. Adsorption measurements present that the higher adsorption density of O-isopropyl-N-ethyl thionocarbamate (IPETC) onto chalcopyrite than that onto galena, and IPETC adsorbed on galena decrease with increasing dextrin concentrations in the presence of dextrin, attesting the flotation results.
