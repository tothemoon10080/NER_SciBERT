Phytate is a major constituent of plants, which comprises 1â€“5% of edible legumes, seeds, cereals, and nuts. Phytate binds with divalent minerals such as zinc and iron to form insoluble mineral complexes, reducing their bioavailability. The aim of this paper is to establish a phytate database in Kuwait for frequently consumed traditional and composite dishes, and to study the role of phytate on zinc and iron bioavailability using phytate:minerals molar ratios. Based on a field survey, 150 frequently consumed traditional and international composite dishes were selected. These dishes were standardized, cooked, and freeze-dried, and their moisture, phytate, iron, and zinc contents were determined chemically. The dishes with no phytate content were excluded. The nutrient data of the selected dishes were tabulated, including moisture, phytate, zinc, iron, and corresponding phytate:mineral ratios were calculated. All nutrient data were standardized according to the global food composition database for phytate. The results showed that 73.5% of the dishes had moderate or high zinc bioavailability. Only 13.2% of the dishes were adequate for iron bioavailability. More research is recommended to study the relationship between phytate and mineral deficiencies, particularly anemia.
