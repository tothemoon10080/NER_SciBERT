Germinated peanuts are an excellent source of bioactive phytochemicals, such as stilbenes and flavonoids, known for their antioxidant properties. Therefore, this study aimed to produce germinated peanut flours from three different cultivars (BR1, BRS Havana, and L7 Vermelho) using convective drying at 70 °C. The flours were then evaluated for their antioxidant activity, phenolic and mineral profiles, as well as their color. Additionally, examined the degradation kinetics of total phenolic compounds during a 16-day storage period. The results showed that germinated peanut flours had high levels of minerals and total phenolic compounds, significant in vitro antioxidant potential and a reddish-yellow color. Various phenolic compounds, particularly Resveratrol, were identified in the flours. Notably, the germinated peanut flour from the BRS Havana cultivar exhibited elevated levels of flavonoids such as Catechin, Procyanidin B2, and Procyanidin B1. The degradation kinetics analysis indicated that higher storage temperatures led to increased degradation, with the most significant losses observed at 35 °C. Furthermore, the BR1 cultivar displayed higher susceptibility to degradation reactions compared to the others. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of germinated peanut flours as a rich source of bioactive compounds, offering valuable antioxidant benefits.
