Rare earth elements (REEs) have emerged as a critical component in manufacturing various products for green technology. This paper aims to comprehensively review the formation of ion adsorption clay, REEs weathering profile, clay mineralsâ€™ potential in adsorbing REEs, ion-exchange mechanism and method for REEs extraction, and the potential of ion adsorption clay as a REEs source in Malaysia. In conclusion, ion adsorption clay has significant potential as a REEs mineral source in Malaysia, where a higher concentration of REEs has been identified compared to China, a developing country in the REEs minerals industry of ion adsorption clay.
