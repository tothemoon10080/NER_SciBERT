Adsorption has proved the strongest water treatment process because of its significant advantages. Clay minerals have been used widely as adsorption to extract harmful heavy metals from the water for decades and are plentiful and inexpensive products. As addressed thoroughly in this analysis, clays and their minerals in both their normal and modified types extract nickel ions from the aqueous solution. Throughout this systematic analysis, comprehensive literature is collected from recent work over the past years and the results from adsorption experiments that clay minerals used as adsorbent. This study paper summarized the preparation of adsorbents, optimum conditions, sorbent capacity, and efficiency and desorption efficiency of many clay minerals and identified their mechanisms of adsorption behavior. The analysis demonstrates the excellent viability of both normal and modified clay minerals in extracting different harmful metal contaminants. The synthesis and the application of novel clay materials to adsorb specific contaminants, to enhance pollution protection, remains to be modified and further research.
