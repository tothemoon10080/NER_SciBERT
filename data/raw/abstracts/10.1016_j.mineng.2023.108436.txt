The usage of flotation reagents has created considerable damage to the environment since a large amount of toxic reagent usage. Under the background of increasing requirements of environmental protection, the utilization of green flotation reagents has attracted more and more attention. The green polymer-type scale inhibitor is the organic polymer previously used in water supply networks, while the researchers recently found its potential ability as the depressant in mineral flotation due to its strong chelating property with various metal ions. The objective of this paper is to present a critical review of the research related to the application of green polymer-type scale inhibitors in froth flotation, with a focus on its practical status and mechanism investigations. The present study was organized and reviewed by dividing scale inhibitors into three types: natural polymer-type scale reagents, derivatives of natural polymer-type reagents, and synthetic polymer-type reagents. The molecular structure, functional property, adsorption mechanism and application case of each reagent were introduced separately and compared comprehensively in the main text, which will provide a vital reference for the development of high-efficient and environmental-friendly reagents in mineral flotation.
