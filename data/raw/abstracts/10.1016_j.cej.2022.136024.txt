A novel ternary composite catalyst (FeOOH/Fe2O3/(Fe0.67Mn0.33)OOH) directly prepared from electrolytic manganese residue was applied for terpineol degradation in this study. The reaction system could remove 76.8% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) from simulated water containing terpineol (100 mg/L), while the degradation process could be accelerated under alkaline condition (84.6% at pH 9.0). The degradation performances of Fe2O3, FeOOH and (Fe0.67Mn0.33)OOH indicated that the in-situ formed (Fe0.67Mn0.33)OOH riched in oxygen vacancies (OV) could promote the PMS activation activity of catalyst mainly ascribed by enhancing interfacial electron transfer.

                      was the primary active radical, the production of which was favored by the metal−OH. This ternary composite catalyst had anti-jamming ability toward most common ions. Further, this system also displayed an outstanding degradation ability for actual mineral processing wastewater (93.2% COD removal). The developed system expanded the horizon for the high-value utilization of metallurgical slag and the treatment of refractory organic pollutants in mineral processing wastewater.
