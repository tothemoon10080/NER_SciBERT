To improve our understanding of As and Se leaching from fly ash it is necessary to know the underlying geochemical processes. It has been previously suggested that sorption processes may control the partitioning of these trace elements during leaching of fly ash. In natural systems, such as soils and sediments, As and Se have been shown to interact with iron oxides at acidic pH, with CaCO3 at alkaline pH and with clay-minerals at neutral pH. By analogy, we compared the leaching of As and Se from fly ash with the sorption of arsenate and selenite on hematite, portlandite and mullite. It was possible to describe the leaching of As and Se from acidic fly ash with a simplified model of surface complexation with iron oxides. The apparent adsorption constants calculated from the leaching experiments resembled those calculated from our sorption experiments with hematite and values published for amorphous iron oxide. The leaching of As and Se from alkaline fly ash was compared with the sorption of arsenate and selenite on portlandite. A Ca-phase was shown to control the leaching process. Portlandite was shown to be an important sorbent for arsenate and to a lesser extent for selenite, at pH > 12.4. The affinity of arsenate and selenite for mullite was low. Maximum sorption was reached in the neutral pH ranges, similar to the interactions of oxyanions with kaolinite. Sorption reversibility of arsenate on all three minerals considered in this study was less, or at least slower, than that of selenite. This feature may partly explain that the fraction of As available for leaching from fly ash is generally lower.
