We evaluated the potential of time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS) combined with chemometric methods for fast identification of U(VI)-bearing minerals in a mining context. We analyzed a sample set which was representative of several environmental conditions. The set consisted of 80 uranium-bearing samples related to mining operations, including natural minerals, minerals with uranium sorbed on the surface, and synthetic phases prepared and characterized specifically for this study. The TRLF spectra were processed using the Ward algorithm and the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) method to reveal similarities between samples and to rapidly identify the uranium-bearing phase and the associated mineralogical family. The predictive models were validated on an independent dataset, and then applied to test samples mostly taken from U mill tailings. Identification results were found to be in accordance with the available characterization data from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDX). This work shows that TRLFS can be an effective decision-making tool for environmental investigations or geological prospection, considering the large diversity of uranium-bearing mineral phases and their low concentration in environmental samples.
