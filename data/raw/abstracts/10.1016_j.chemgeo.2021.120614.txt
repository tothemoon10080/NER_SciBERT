The rapid increase of nanoparticles in the environment has occurred largely as a result of anthropogenic activities, such as industrialization, including accelerated mining activities, the manufacture and proliferation of plastic waste, the overuse of fertilizers and pesticides, pharmaceutical manufacture and many more. Recent research highlights the formation of nanoparticles, especially in the light of mineral/crystal growth by non-classical growth mechanisms, whereby solids form from prenucleation species or clusters within an aqueous solution from which solid nanoparticles precipitate. This is very often related to the dissolution of an existing mineral/solid phase that is coupled at the mineral-fluid interface with the precipitation of a new more stable phase. Examples given here highlight nanoparticle formation and potential environmental remediation strategies, such as carbon mineralization and toxic element sequestration. Recent advances in analytical techniques such as atomic force microscopy, advanced scanning and transmission microscopies are enabling the imaging of nanoparticles presented in this review.
