In this study, metakaolin was partially replaced with mineral micropowder to prepare a mineral-micropowder/metakaolin-based geopolymer was prepared under alkali activation, and the compressive and flexural strengths of various geopolymer specimens were determined. Geopolymer reaction kinetics were examined using the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogrov model, and the effects of the mineral-micropowder content on the properties and structure of the metakaolin-based geopolymer were investigated. Results revealed that micropowder addition significantly influenced the mechanical properties, microstructure, and reaction heat of the geopolymer. At a powder content of 30 wt%, the polymer exhibited superior mechanical properties; furthermore, the compressive and flexural strengths of the specimens cured for 28 d were 58.3 MPa and 12.6 MPa, which were 24.1% and 40% higher than those of the control group, respectively. Meanwhile, the geopolymer setting time was significantly reduced because the presence of calcium in mineral micropowder promoted the geopolymerisation reaction. Therefore, the formation of a multi-gel phase considerably enhanced the geopolymer structure.
