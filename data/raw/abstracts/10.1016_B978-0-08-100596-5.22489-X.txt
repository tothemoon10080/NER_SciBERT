The interactions between milk proteins and minerals are critical to milk functionality and the nutritional benefits that milk provides. The binding of minerals to proteins stabilizes protein conformation and facilitates catalysis by enzymes. Protein and mineral interactions in milk aid in maximizing mineral absorption due to the stabilization of ionization states, and increased mineral solubility. Several intrinsic and extrinsic factors can affect the association between milk proteins and minerals. For example, composition of milk from different species can affect the native protein and mineral interactions. Further processing by thermal, concentration, and/or fermentation can also alter protein structure and the subsequent interactions with mineral. While, the analysis of individual protein and or peptide fractions is possible, accurate quantification of mineral and protein associations is difficult within the native milk matrix. Understanding the relationships between protein and minerals in milk, and how they are affected by processing is important to maximize the nutritional benefits of dairy products for the consumer.
