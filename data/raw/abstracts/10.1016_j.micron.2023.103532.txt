CO2 mineralization in slag has gained significant attention since it occurs with minimal human intervention and energy input. While the amount of theoretical CO2 that can be captured within slag has been quantified based on slag composition in several studies, the microstructural and mineralogical effects of slag on its ability to capture CO2 have not been fully addressed. In this work, the CO2 uptake within legacy slag samples is analyzed through microstructural characterization. Slag samples were collected from the former Ravenscraig steelmaking site in Lanarkshire, Scotland. The collected samples were studied using X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) to understand the distribution and geometry of pore space, as well as with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to visualize the distribution of elements within the studied samples. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was used to study the minerals distribution. The samples were also characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and the amount of captured CO2 was quantified using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Our results demonstrate that CO2 uptake occurs to the extent of ∼9–30 g CO2/ kg slag. The studied samples are porous in nature, with pore space occupying up to ∼30% of their volumes, and they are dominated by åkermanite-gehlenite minerals which interact with the atmospheric CO2 slowly at ambient conditions. EDS and EBSD results illustrate that the precipitated carbonate in slag is calcite, and that the precipitation of calcite is accompanied by the formation of a Si-O-rich layer. The provided analysis concludes that the porous microstructure as well as the minerals distribution in slag should be considered in forecasting and designing large-scale solutions for passive CO2 mineralization in slag.
