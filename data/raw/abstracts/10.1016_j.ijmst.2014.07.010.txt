In the present study, a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation together with experimental field measurements was applied to optimize the performance of an industrial hydrocyclone at Sarcheshmeh copper complex. In the simulation, the Eulerian–Eulerian approach was used for solid and liquid phases, the latter being water. In this approach, nine continuous phases were considered for the solid particles with different sizes and one continuous phase for water. The continuity and momentum equations with inclusion of buoyancy and drag forces were solved by the finite volume method. The k–ɛ RNG turbulence model was used for modeling of turbulency. There was a good agreement between the simulation results and the experimental data. After validation of the model accuracy, the effect of inlet solid percentage, pulp inlet velocity, rod inserting in the middle of the hydrocyclone and apex diameter on hydrocyclone performance was investigated. The results showed that by decreasing the inlet solid percentage and increasing the pulp inlet velocity, the efficiency of hydrocyclone increased. Decreasing the apex diameter caused an increase in the hydrocyclone efficiency.
