The results of investigations into the hydration and dehydration of pure samples of pit-coal (from the Lublin Coal Basin) and limestone are presented. On the basis of these results, we have concluded that the adsorption capacity of these minerals depends on the physicochemical properties of the surface, and in particular on their surface area. We have confirmed the existence of the so-called bonded water on the surface, which modified the surface properties of the minerals investigated. The investigations of pit-coal samples covered with diesel oil show a large decrease in adsorption capacity of its surface that leads practically to an increase in the effectiveness of the cleaning process.
