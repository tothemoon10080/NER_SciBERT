Electrochemical degradation performances of three non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen (ACT), aspirin (ASP) and ibuprofen (IBP), were investigated and compared in their alone and mixture conditions using Ti/SnO2-Sb/La-PbO2. The pseudo-first-order degradation kinetics (k) order was k

                     EO) value of 6.55 Wh/L could ensure the synchronous degradation of the NSAIDs mixture. The mineralization efficiency of NSAIDs mixture was 86.9% at 240 min with a mineralization current efficiency of 1.67%. Acetic acid and oxalic acid were the main products in the mineralization process for the both conditions. In the mixture condition, there were higher k values at lower initial concentrations and higher current density, while the presence of carbonate and humic acid inhibited their degradation. The results indicated electrochemical advanced oxidation process can effectively and synchronously mineralize NSAIDs mixture in wastewater.
