Interaction with soil mineral particles (SMPs) and organic matters can significantly determine the fate of nanoparticles (NPs) in the environment such as waters, sediments, and soils. In this study, the heteroaggregation of CeO2 NPs with different soil minerals (kaolinite, montmorillonite, goethite and hematite) and the influence of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) were studied. The obvious heteroaggregation between CeO2 NPs with different SMPs were demonstrated via co-settling and aggregation kinetics experiments. The variety in the heteroaggregation between CeO2 NPs with different SMPs is mainly induced by the difference in their surface properties, such as surface charge, specific surface areas and surface complexation. The presence of EPS can result in great inhibition on the heteroaggregation between CeO2 NPs with the positive charged goethite by enhancing the electrostatic repulsion between NPs and mineral colloids. However, the influence of EPS on the interaction between CeO2 NPs with negative charged SMPs is more dependent on the steric stabilization. The presence of EPS may promote the migration of CeO2 NPs in environment and then increase their risks to human health and ecosystems. These findings contribute to better understanding interactions between NPs and SMPs and have important implications on predicting the behaviors and risks of NPs in the natural environment.
