Side reactions and dendrite growth triggered by the unstable interface and inhomogeneous deposition have become the biggest obstacle to the commercialization for lithium metal batteries. In this study, a highly-chlorinated organic-inorganic hybrid interfacial protective layer is developed by rationally tuning the interfacial passivation and robustness to achieve the convenient and efficient Li metal anode. The polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can effectively resist water and oxygen, which is confirmed by density functional theory. The organic-dominant solid electrolyte interphases (SEI) with lithium chloride are investigated by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with little mineralization of oxide, such as Li2O and Li2CO3. With such artificial SEI, a uniform and dense lithium deposition morphology are formed and an ultra-long stable cycle of over 500 hours are achieved even at an ultra-high current density of 10 mA/cm2. Moreover, the simple and convenient protected anode also exhibits excellent battery stability when paired with the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) and LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode, showing great potential for the commercial application of lithium metal batteries.
