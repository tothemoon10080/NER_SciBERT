Generally, the sequence decision of the development and utilization of Chinese mineral resources is based on national and provincial overall plan of the mineral resources. Such plan usually cannot reflect the relative size of the suitability of the development and utilization of mineral resources. To solve the problem, the paper has selected the gift condition, the market condition, the technological condition, socio-economic condition and environmental condition as the starting-points to analyze the influential factors of the priority-sequence of mineral resourcesâ€™ development and utilization. The above 5 conditions are further specified into 9 evaluative indicators to establish an evaluation indicator system. At last, we propose a decision model of the priority sequence based on grey relational analysis method, and figure out the observation objects by the suitability index of development. Finally, the mineral resources of a certain province in China were analyzed as an example. The calculation results indicate that silver (2.0057), coal (1.9955), zinc (1.9442), cement limestone (1.9077), solvent limestone (1.5624) and other minerals in the province are suitable for development and utilization.
