Coal dust prevention is crucial for the environment and the safety of coal miners. This study proposed a biomimetic mineralized dust suppressant (BMDS) with polyacrylic acid (PAA) modifier, based on calcium carbonate precipitation technology. The consolidation effect of BMDS on coal dust was evaluated through wind erosion resistance tests, unconfined compressive strength tests, and microscopic characterizations. The results show that the consolidation effect of the BMDS on coal dust heavily depends on the PAA concentration. When the PAA concentration is 4g/L and the concentration of calcium chloride and sodium carbonate is 0.5mol/L, the BMDS presents the best dust suppression effect and could realize the practical application requirements. The generated calcium carbonate is mainly calcite type, and the efficiency of cementing coal dust particles is the highest. Moreover, similar to bacteria in biological dust suppressants, it confirms that PAA could effectively modify the nucleation and growth of calcium carbonate, promote the adhesion of calcium carbonate to the surface of coal dust particles, and enable the generated calcium carbonate to effectively bond coal dust particles. Accordingly, the BMDS with PAA modifier can be effectively used in the prevention of secondary coal dust pollution.
