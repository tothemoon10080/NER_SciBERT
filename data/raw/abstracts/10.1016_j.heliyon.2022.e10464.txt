Northeast (NE) India possesses a rich diversity of rice cultivars including pigmented and non pigmented varieties. The pigmented rice is reported to possess a considerable amount of antioxidant compounds, free radical scavengers etc. In this study, eleven (black, red and white) rice cultivars of NE India were analyzed for antioxidant potentials, mineral and protein contents. Total phenolic content ranged from 94.8 (Idaw) to 900.90 mg GAE/100 g (Lumre). Total flavonoid content varied from 3.46 (Idaw) to 286.76 mg QE/100 g (Menil mibabaret). Total anthocyanin content varied from 0.23 (Farel) to 93.52 mg/100 g (Chakhao poireiton). The pigmented rice is also good sources of Catalase (CAT), Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) that can significantly reduce stress oxidative reactions. Chakhao poireiton possessed the highest Ni and Mn content, Tsulu tsuk had the highest Zn content, while Fazu and Tasung contained the highest Fe and Ca. The highest total protein was found in Chakhao poireiton (11.06%). And all the cultivars were found to be aromatic. Fourier Transformed Infra-Red spectroscopy (FTIR) identified various signature peaks and could discriminate the cultivars into pigmented and non pigmented. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) revealed the grouping of the cultivars based on the functional groups present. The present study could provide a better understanding of choosable rice lines for human consumption and also as germplasm resources for future rice improvement programs.
