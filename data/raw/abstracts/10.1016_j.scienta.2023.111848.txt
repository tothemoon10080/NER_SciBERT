Introduction
                  Food-based approach is a sustainable and cost-effective option to counter micronutrient malnutrition in public health particularly in poor communities. The present study aimed to develop F1 hybrids from early-and mid-maturity groups of Indian cauliflower rich in essential dietary nutrients.
               
                  Materials and methods
                  Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) based 50 F1 hybrids (10 CMS lines × 5 testers) from early-maturity group and 20 F1 crosses (5 CMS lines × 4 testers) from mid-maturity group were generated in line × tester mating design and evaluated in randomized block design in respective maturity groups in 2020–21. Eight dietary minerals content were analysed in curd portion using atomic absorbance spectrophotometer and sulphur by barium sulphate turbidimetry method.
               
                  Results
                  The CMS lines, fertile inbred lines and F1 crosses from both maturity groups showed significant variation in minerals content. Best combiners for minerals in early group were CMS 999–41–5 (Fe, Mn, Mg, Ca, S) and CMS 4348–41–5 (Zn, Na) in CMS lines while DC 98–2 (Cu, Ca) and DC 67 (Zn, Mn, Na) among the testers. In mid group, CMS 8401 (Fe, Na, Ca, K) and CMS 1944–309 (Zn, S) CMS lines and DC 401 (Fe, S, K) and DC 476 (Cu, Mn, Na) testers were good combiners. The best heterotic hybrids in early group were CEH35 for Fe, CEH27 for Zn and Na, CEH38 for Cu and Mn and CEH43 for Ca. In mid group, CMH2 was most heterotic for Fe and Mn and CMH4 for Ca content.
               
                  Discussion
                  The study revealed significant levels of GCA and SCA effects for important dietary minerals in cauliflower genotypes. The information has potential use in hybrid breeding in order to develop nutrient-rich F1 hybrids in cauliflower for food-based approach to counter micronutrient malnutrition which is a serious problem in the current world.
