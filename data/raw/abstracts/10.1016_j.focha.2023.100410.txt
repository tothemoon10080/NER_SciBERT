It is recognized that collagen peptides can promote osteoblast mineralization; however, the responsible peptides are not clearly identified. To this end, the peptides obtained from bovine bone collagen hydrolysates with stimulatory effects on osteoblast mineralization were fractionated using a series of chromatographic methods. Six peptides from the fraction possessing the most powerful mineralization stimulation ability were identified via LC-MS-MS analysis. Six peptides exhibited enhanced bioactivity-inducing properties. Moreover, it was found that the interaction between peptides and integrinα5β1 may be responsible for osteoblast mineralization stimulation activity.
