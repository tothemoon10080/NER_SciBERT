Calcium minerals are ubiquitous in geology and life chemistry. Understanding the phase and chemical state of calcium minerals is important for numerous processes including materials chemistry, hard tissue biogenesis and geological processes. Photoemission spectroscopies such as near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy have been instrumental in identifying and characterizing calcium minerals in all these areas. In this work, we have recorded reference spectra for a range of different calcium minerals including a series of calcium carbonates, calcium oxalates and calcium phosphates. While collections of reference spectra for several calcium minerals can be found in the literature, these spectra have been reported in different contexts using a variety of instruments. We, here, report a comprehensive list of references recorded in parallel in a single experiment by imaging an array of calcium minerals using a NEXAFS microscope. We present reference NEXAFS spectra at the calcium L-, carbon K- and oxygen K-edges.
