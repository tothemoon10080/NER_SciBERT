Dysphagia is a condition that affects the ability to chew and swallow food and beverages, having a major impact on people's health and wellbeing. This work developed gel systems with a customized texture suitable for intake by dysphagic people using 3D printing and milk. Gels were developed using skim powdered milk, cassava starch (native and modified by the Dry Heating Treatment (DHT)), and different concentrations of kappa-carrageenan (ĸC). The gels were evaluated in relation to the starch modification process and concentration of gelling agents, 3D printing performance, and suitability for dysphagic people (following both the standard fork test described by the International Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative (IDDSI), and also using a new device coupled to a texture analyzer). Moreover, the best formulations were evaluated for mineral bioaccessibility through simulated gastrointestinal digestion based on INFOGEST 2.0 standardized method. The results showed that ĸC had a dominant effect compared to the DHT-modified starch on gel texture, 3D printing performance, and fork tests. The gels obtained by molding or 3D printing resulted in different behaviors during the fork test, which was associated with the gel extrusion process that breaks down their initial structure. The strategies applied to tailor the texture of the milk did not affect the mineral bioaccessibility, which was kept high (>80%).
