The rare-earth elements (REE), which encompass the fifteen metallic elements of the lanthanoid series of the periodic table, yttrium and occasionally scandium, have gained enormous public, economic and scientific attention in recent years. These elements, which have been found in over 250 minerals, are of high economic and strategic importance to many high-technology industries. As such they have been designated as critical materials by several countries and many new deposits are being developed. Rare-earth mineral (REM) deposits can be broadly classified into four geological environments: carbonates, alkaline/peralkaline igneous rocks, placers and ion adsorption clays. Apart from ion adsorption clay deposits, which require no mineral processing steps, froth flotation is the most applied beneficiation technique. This paper reviews the flotation of REM, covering their surface chemical properties as well as the various flotation reagents which have been employed.
