Investigation of unloading rock failure under different σ
                     2 facilitates the control mechanism of excavation surrounding rock. This study focused on single-sided unloading tests of granite specimens under true triaxial conditions. The strength and failure characteristics were studied with micro-camera and acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. Furthermore, the choice of test path and the effect of σ
                     2 on fracture of unloading rock were discussed. Results show that the increased σ
                     2 can strengthen the stability of single-sided unloading rock. After unloading, the rock's free surface underwent five phases, namely, inoculation, particle ejection, buckling rupture, stable failure, and unstable rockburst phases. Moreover, at σ
                     2≤30 MPa, the b value shows the following variation tendency: rising, dropping, significant fluctuation, and dropping, with dispersed damages signal. At σ
                     2≥40 MPa, the tendency shows: a rise, a decrease, a slight fluctuation, and final drop, with concentrated damages signal. After unloading, AE energy is mainly concentrated in the micro-energy range. With the increased σ
                     2, the micro-energy ratio rises. In contrast, low, medium and large energy ratios drop gradually. The increased tensile fractures and decreased shear fractures indicate that the failure mode of the unloading rock gradually changes from tensile-shear mode to tensile-split one. The fractional dimension of the rock fragments first increases and then decreases with an inflection point at 20 MPa. The distribution of SIF on the planes changes as σ
                     2 increases, resulting in strengthening and then weakening of the rock bearing capacity.
