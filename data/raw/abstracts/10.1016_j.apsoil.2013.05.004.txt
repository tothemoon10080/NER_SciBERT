Microbial composition is known, on similar soil types, to vary based on differing organic matter inputs, or stand composition. Fine-textured luvisolic soils, which dominate the upland boreal forests of Western Canada, support a canopy cover of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) or a mixture of the two. These soils then reflect different belowground biogeochemical processing of organic matter. Novel, anthropogenic soils formed from a combination of peat litter and fine textured mineral soil, are now also a part of the landscape in the western boreal. This study set out to determine if a simple labeled compound (13C glucose) was processed differently by soils from the two dominant stand types (aspen and spruce) and from an anthropogenic (newly reclaimed) site. Results indicate that while all three soils rapidly incorporated and respired the labeled carbon, each maintained a distinct microbial community structure (as evidenced by phospholipid fatty acid analysis) throughout the 300hour experiment. Therefore soils with different microbial communities from varied organic matter inputs decompose organic carbon by different processes, even in the case of simple labile compounds.
