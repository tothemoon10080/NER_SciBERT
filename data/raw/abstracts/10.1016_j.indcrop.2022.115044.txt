This paper presents the results of the experimental studies on lightning impulse breakdown tests of two categories of vegetable oil – saturated versus unsaturated. The saturated vegetable oils comprise refined, bleached, and deodorized coconut oil and virgin coconut oil (i.e., RBDCO and VCO), while the unsaturated vegetable oil is the most commonly used soybean oil called ‘MIDEL eN1215′. The differences in the impulse breakdown performance of the two categories of vegetable oil were analyzed from the perspective of molecular ionization and ionization potential. The effect of the residual mineral oil on impulse breakdown performance was also studied and analyzed. A point-sphere electrode system was used in this study. It is observed that at a 12.5 mm gap, the lightning impulse breakdown voltage (LIBDV) of both RBDCO and VCO were nearly similar to natural ester oil (NEO) subjected to positive excitation, but with negative excitation, the latter appears to be inferior. At twice the electrode gap, LIBDV can easily differentiate between unsaturated and saturated vegetable oils, whatever be the polarity of excitation. With mineral oil, up to 20%, LIBDVs of vegetable oil tend to increase. This is mainly important with positive excitation, especially in NEO, where up to a 25% increase was observed as against pure oil.
