A transformation of C-t kinetic data into a normalized state variable function produces information that permits the identification of kinetic processes. In this paper a number of these state variable functions are presented in a functional as well as a bit map/pattern form. This constitutes the catalogue from which the kinetics may be classified via the presented algorithm. The classification is performed by trained multi-layer perceptrons as well as pattern associators. The presented algorithm is tested and illustrated by a number of theoretical and practical examples.
