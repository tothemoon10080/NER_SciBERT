A gas migration controlling equation was formulated based on the characteristics of the dual pore–fracture media of coal mass and in consideration of the matrix exchange between pores and fractures. A model of permeability dynamic evolution was established by analyzing the variation in effective stress during gas drainage and the action mechanism of the effect of coal matrix desorption on porosity and fracture in the coal body. A coupling model can then be obtained to characterize gas compressibility and coal deformability under the gas–solid coupling of loading coal. In addition, a 3D model of boreholes was established and solved for gas drainage based on the relevant physical parameters of real mines. The comparison and analysis results for the law of gas migration and the evolution of coal body permeability around the boreholes before and after gas extraction between the dual media and the single-seepage field models can provide a theoretical basis for further research on the action mechanism of gas drainage.
