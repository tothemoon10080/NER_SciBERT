Clay minerals are ceramics materials that are involved in a wide range of economic uses. But, their structure and composition are modified by heating and, consequently, compromise their final applications. The actual temperatures at which changes occur vary greatly from one group to another group and even for different specimens within a given group. The aim of this research has been to evaluate the thermal behaviour of a set of design swelling micas, Na-Mica-n (Mn) and compare them with a set of natural smectites. All samples were heated in the range 200 °C to 1000 °C; afterwards, they were rehydrated thorough water suspension (0.4% wt). The results have shown that swelling micas have better property of hydration/dehydration than natural clay minerals and those with higher layer charge exhibited higher rehydration ability and dehydration temperature.
