Thermally activated persulfate (TAP) finds application in Advanced Oxidation Processes for the removal of pollutants from contaminated water and soil. This paper reviewed the various cases of TAP in the environmental remediation. The pollutants such as individual pharmaceuticals, biocides, cyclic organic compounds, and dyes are considered in this review. It is interesting to note that most of the organic compounds undergo complete degradation at a high temperature of 70Â°C with a first-order reaction kinetics. The influence of operating parameters such as temperature, persulfate concentration, initial pH, and degradation behavior in the presence of natural water constituents are also discussed. In addition, several processes to reduce the temperature of TAP are highlighted.
