With large latent heat and nearly constant phase change temperature, phase change material (PCM) is an ideal energy storage material, but it suffers from severe leakage problems in applications. With large specific surface area, low cost, and easy availability, minerals have been widely used to encapsulate PCM to address its leakage issue. Meanwhile, various methods have been proposed to improve the two critical thermal performances of mineral-based FSPCMs, i.e., latent heat and thermal conductivity. In this review, we summarize and analyze the fundamental principles of the PCM encapsulation techniques using minerals. Then, we review the underlying mechanisms and the methods for improving the latent heats and thermal conductivities of the mineral-based FSPCMs, respectively. Finally, we present the practical applications of the mineral-based FSPCMs and discuss their future developments. The study provides a timely review of the mineral-based FSPCMs, which help improve the encapsulation techniques, performance improvements, and practical applications. The discussion for future developments may help concentrate efforts on solving the key issues in urgent need.
