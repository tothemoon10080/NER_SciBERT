An air dense medium fluidized bed separator (ADMFBS) is used for dry beneficiation of coal using ultra-fine magnetite particles as a pseudo-fluid medium. In this process, the coal particle gains additional weight due to coating on its surface and deposition at dead zone area by fine magnetite particles. Hence, the effective density of coal particle increases and the position of coal particle changes accordingly. In this work, an attempt was made to predict the position of coal particle in non-bubbling condition dense medium fluidized bed system. Coal particles of different shape such as cubical, rectangular prism, spherical and triangular prism with different projected area and density were used. The results show that the position of coal particle in air dense medium fluidized bed follows descending order with respect to the increase of density, projected area of coal particle and different shapes (i.e., triangular prism, cubical, rectangular prism and spherical). Empirical mathematical correlations were developed to predict the position of coal particle.
