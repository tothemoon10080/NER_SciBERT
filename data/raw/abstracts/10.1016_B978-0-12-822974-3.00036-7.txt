The dissolution and precipitation of minerals control the physical properties and chemical composition of soil, speciation and reactivity of contaminants, and preservation of soil organic matter. In this chapter, the basic theories of mineral dissolution and precipitation are first introduced conceptually. Then the biotic and abiotic mineral dissolution processes and the formation and transformation processes of the precipitated soil minerals are discussed with examples of common soil minerals. Lastly, the environmental significance of soil mineral dissolution and precipitation is addressed from the perspective of the sequestration of heavy metals and soil organic matter.
