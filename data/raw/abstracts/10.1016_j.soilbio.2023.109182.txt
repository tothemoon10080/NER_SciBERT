Understanding the determinants of soil carbon mineralization at both the aggregate and rhizosphere levels is crucial for providing precise feedback on climate change. However, the specific patterns and relative contributions of rhizosphere effects on carbon mineralization at the aggregate scale remain unclear. To address this, we conducted an incubation experiment to examine the impact of warming on soil carbon mineralization. We also assessed variations in microbial activities and soil properties across different aggregates in both rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils, while exploring how the rhizosphere effects modulated the response of soil respiration to warming. Our findings revealed that rhizosphere soil provides a favorable environment for microbial activities through increased nutrient input and aggregate stability, leading to significant increases in microbial biomass and enzyme activity, thus promoting soil carbon mineralization. Moreover, the spatial heterogeneity of soil aggregates contributes to the differentiation and diversity of microbial community distribution, which further enhances the diversification of carbon mineralization at the aggregate level. Notably, macroaggregates play a significant role in soil carbon flux, making a substantial contribution to carbon turnover in the ecosystem. The partial least squares (PLS) path analysis indicated that the rhizosphere positively increased the contributions of soil properties and microbial variables to the overall amount of soil cumulative mineralization, with soil nutrients playing a crucial role among these factors. These findings highlight the complex regulatory role of substrate quality in soil carbon mineralization dynamics at the aggregate scale, underscoring its far-reaching implications for accurately predicting the feedback to climate change in soil carbon mineralization.
