Superoxide radical (•O2

                     − by modulating a partial hydration state through spatial confinement control. We demonstrated this idea by conducting heterogeneous Fenton reaction with layered iron oxychloride (FeOCl) catalyst, wherein •O2
                     −radicals produced and confined within the catalyst structure (interlayer spacing of 7.92 Å) showed defluorination effect dealing with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as model compound. The defluorination combined with advanced oxidation achieved mineralization. Mechanism study revealed that the confinement frustrated the hydration shell of •O2
