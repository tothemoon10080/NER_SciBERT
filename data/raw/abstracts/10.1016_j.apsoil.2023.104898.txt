Soil nitrogen mineralization (Nmin) generally controls the availability and circulation of soil nitrogen (N). To better understand the mechanisms of soil Nmin and environmental protection, this study explored the dynamics of net Nmin in soils from restored forests and the effect of soil physicochemical properties (SPPs) and soil microbial mineralization genes (SMGs) on Nmin. Field studies were conducted from July 2019 to April 2020 in five representative restored forests in the mountainous region of northwestern Hebei, China (i.e., Larix principis-rupprechtii forest (LF), Betula platyphylla forest (BF), mixed forest of Larix principis-rupprechtii and Betula platyphylla (MF), Picea asperata forest (SF) and Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica forest (MPF)), and soil net nitrogen mineralization rate (Rmin), SPPs and SMGs were determined after collecting soil samples in five plots. The influence of restored forests and seasonality on Rmin was investigated to determine the characteristics of the dynamics of soil net Nmin. Principal component analysis (PCA) and variation partitioning analysis (VPA) revealed that soil properties and functional genes could explain approximately 80Â % of the variation in Nmin. SMGs significantly contributed to the variation in the soil net ammonification rate (Ramm) and nitrification rate (Rnit) compared to soil properties. SMGs were strongly correlated with Ramm\Rnit (except in LF), implying that the shifts in functional genes may control Rmin. Given the debate on the role of soil properties and N cycling genes in driving soil N transformation, this study provides new insights into the controlled effect of microbial functional genes during the early stage of forest restoration in the cold temperate zone.
