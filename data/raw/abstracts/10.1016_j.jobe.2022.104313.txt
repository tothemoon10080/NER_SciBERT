Rheology is an effective tool that describes concrete workability, flowability, predictive stability and pumpability. A comprehensive review of recently published rheological properties of fresh cement paste containing ultrafine mineral admixtures is presented in this paper. An applicable rheological model for cement paste containing ultrafine mineral admixtures is revealed. The effects of different kinds of ultrafine mineral admixtures, chemical admixtures, water/binder ratio and temperature on rheological properties are discussed. The addition of ultrafine mineral admixtures commonly makes cement paste show nonlinear rheological behavior, and increases the yield stress and plastic viscosity of cement paste. Adding ultrafine mineral admixtures in cement paste increases the demand for chemical admixtures. The rheological properties of cement pastes containing ultrafine mineral admixture are more sensitive to temperature. Temperature affects the rheological properties by affecting the hydration rate and inter-particle bonding. Increasing water/binder ratio weakens the negative influence of ultrafine mineral admixtures on the rheological properties.
