The automation in mining, mineral and metal processing is evolving toward the computer integrated production syste (CIPS) just as CIMS denoted by the manufacture. CIPS is a large scale, complex, time varrying, real time and man machine system is general. Any single knowledge domain can not solve it completely. Therefore, the combination of traditional approach and knowledge engineering is a naturally effective way to improve the performance due to make uo each other's deficiencies. the enginering applications if A1 to CIPS involve direct control, supervision, interpretation, diagnosis, scheduling, planning and design in the scope of CIPS functionality. However, since the system science and A1 were developed seperately for a long time, the pioneering knowledge-based systems are not suitable completely for applications to CIPS or CIMS in real world. so, the A1 knowledge engineerring should be further developed to meet the advanced requirements. the major issues among the advanced A1 techniques suitable for solving CIPS's problems are knowledge object, object model, real time A1, knowledge parallel processing, hybrid knowledge representation, neural network(NN) AND synergism of NN, ES AND Fuzzy control, which will be intoduced in the last parts of this paper. they emphasize on the recent applications either in CIPS or in CIMS for sharing the knowledge.
