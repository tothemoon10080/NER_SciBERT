Mining and mineral exploration has many effects on the surrounding environment. The present study reviews the hydrological and environmental impacts of coal and nonmetal mining operations by mine lifecycle stages and facility patterns. Further, a critical review of regulations and policies in South Korea focusing on the mining-water interaction, conservation, and management was performed to emphasize the current state of legislation in the country. The counties where mining was the primary employer in Gangwon-do province in South Korea were assessed for the mining impact on the community's social life and com-pared to the non-mining counties in the same province. The results of the comparative study showed the less education, healthcare and employment chances in mining counties than the adjacent counties with no mining activities.
