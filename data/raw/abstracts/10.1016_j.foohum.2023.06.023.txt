Seaweeds are important components in the food, medical and cosmetic industries. Thus, the interest in using seaweeds for their nutritional and industrial value is increasing. The study compared proximate and mineral content of three seaweed species: cheatomorpha linum (green seaweed), Gracilaria corticata (red seaweed) and Padina boergesenii (brown seaweed) from the Massawa Red Sea coast, and with one green leafy vegetable, spinach (Spinacia oleracea). The results revealed that, crude fiber content of cheatomorpha linum (23 ± 0.37 %) was significantly higher than Padina boergesenii (9.19 ± 0.35 %), Gracilaria corticata (4.56 ± 0.17 %), and Spinacia oleracea (8.41 ± 1.10 %) (p < 0.001). Padina boergesenii recorded maximum levels of macrominerals: Ca (37.85 ± 0.64 g.kg−1) and Mg (12.80 ± 0.14 g.kg−1), microminerals: Fe (3.8 ± 1.41 g.kg−1) and Mn (201 ± 5.66 mg.kg−1) than Gracilaria corticata, cheatomorpha linum and Spinacia oleracea. From the present study, the highest mineral content (K) in Gracilaria corticata and (Ca, Mg, Fe and Mn) in Padina boergesenii indicates to use seaweed as ingredient in food industries. This research paper also could use as nutritional baseline information.
