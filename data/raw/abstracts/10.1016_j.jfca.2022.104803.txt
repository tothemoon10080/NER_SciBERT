Mineral element fingerprint analysis technology is one of the effective methods for grain origin identification. The accuracy of the identification model is closely related to sample geographical origin, including sample year and sample quantity. In order to study the influence of sample year and quantity on the origin identification of mineral elements. The content of mineral elements in rice was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Stoichiometry methods were combined to establish provenance models for different years and sample quantities. The results showed that the accuracy rate of the origin traceability model based on multi-year rice (2018â€“2020) was 100.0 %. It improved the accuracy of the model by 12.0 % compared with the model established in a single year (2019). The accuracy of origin tracing model for rice with 236 varieties was 98.8 %. The accuracy of rice model with smaller sample size (83 samples) increased by 3.8 %. It verifies and compares the model accuracy of origin discrimination of 15 randomly collected rice samples from three producing areas. The number of correct discriminations (15) for the model of multi-year rice was more than that of single year (13). The number of correct discriminations (15) was more than the number of small samples (12). This indicates that the year and the quantity of samples are two important factors to be considered in the establishment of discriminant model. Multiple sample years and multiple sample quantities were used to improve the accuracy of the model. It also provides a theoretical basis for the establishment and standardization of agricultural product traceability method.
