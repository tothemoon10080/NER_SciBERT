This chapter investigates mining processes and their role in disasters. These disasters involve mining explosions and cave-in, slurry storage and spills, and the substances themselves such as arsenic. The chapter includes details on the mining and the toxicities involved in mercury, cadmium, lead, arsenic, asbestos, and gold mining and attendant problems with cyanide leaching. The chapter introduces inorganic chemistry since these problems often involve metals and other inorganic materials. Mineralization is explained, i.e., transformation of larger organic compounds to simpler organic and ultimately inorganic substances. However, mineral extraction and processing disasters involving organic substances (e.g., coal) are also discussed, e.g., problems related to surface mining. The concepts of value and valuation are introduced in the context of mining and minerals.
