Mineral processing plant performance depends on multiple factors, including the feed and the parameters to control the process. In this work, we show how to assess plant performance using geometallurgical modeling and dynamic simulation. Several models that describe comminution, classification, flotation, and residence time distribution (RTD) are implemented as modules and then connected to represent generic plant configurations. The estimation of the RTD is used to assess the ore blending generated within the plant through a methodology based on weighting the ore contribution at the plant discharge. Additionally, the RTD is used to display the ore permanence at different plant stages, which can be used as an operational input to anticipate the consequences of a perturbation in the feed. Different simulation scenarios are tested using synthetic data, including different plant configurations, time support for blending assessment, and ore feeding sequence. The results show that the simulation is sensitive to these attributes. Significant differences are detected in the generated product compositions when the plant configuration is changed. Also, distinct mine plans can be evaluated through simulation, predicting their processing performance. Therefore, the simulation tool developed can be used to evaluate real mineral processing operations and to test different operative strategies.
