In view of the occurrence of the coal and gas, outburst coal body separates in series of layer form, and tosses in a series of coal shell, and the morphological characteristics of the holes that formed in the coal layers are very similar to some iterative morphological characteristics of the system state under highly nonlinear condition in chaos theory. Two kinds of morphology as well as their starting and end states are comparatively studied in this paper. The research results indicate that the outburst coal and rock system is in a chaotic state of lower nested hierarchy before outburst, and the process that lots of holes form owing to continuous outburst of a series of coal shells in a short time is in a rhythmical fast iterative stage of intermittent chaos state. And the state of the coal-gas system is in a stable equilibrium state after outburst. The behaviors of outburst occurrence, development and termination, based on the universal properties of various nonlinear mappings in describing complex problems, can be described by iterative operation in mathematics which uses the Logistic function
