Dairy products play a role in the Sustainable Development Goals being a source of high-quality protein (Goal 2) and a profitable branch of economy (Goal 8). The aim of the study was to analyse the content of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), sodium (Na) and riboflavin (vitamin B2) in 65 yogurts, yogurts to drink, kefirs, buttermilks and homogenized cheese of different flavours. In general, all analysed products had significant content of Ca (43–137 mg 100 g−1) and vitamin B2 (0.09–0.23 mg 100 g−1), moderate of K (79–173 mg 100 g−1) and low of Mg (6–11 mg 100 g−1). Four products could be labelled with nutrition claim of ‘source of calcium’ and two with ‘source of vitamin B2’. At the same time, none of analysed products delivered more than 150 kcal and 70 mg of Na in 100 g and all were available for less than 0.50 EUR per 100 g. Flavoured dairy products, as nutritious alternative to unhealthy snacks, can be considered as a part of a sustainable diet being affordable and culturally acceptable.
