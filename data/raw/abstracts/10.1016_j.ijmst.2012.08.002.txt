Fluid inclusions from samples from the layered and veined mineralized belt in the Mopan mine area were studied using microscopic temperature measurements and laser Raman spectroscopy. Further studies were conducted on the nature and source of the ore forming fluid and on the mechanism of deposit formation. The results show that there are three types of inclusions that occur in both the layered and veined ore body. These are liquid inclusions, CO2 inclusions with a liquid phase, and NaClâ€“H2O multi-phase inclusions. The fluid inclusions in both the layered and veined ore bodies have similar characteristics. The ore forming fluid is strongly reducing, was exposed to low to medium temperatures, salinity, and pressures. The source of this ore forming fluid was a mix of submarine volcanic spring (blow-piping), magmatic hydrothermal jet, and underground water.
