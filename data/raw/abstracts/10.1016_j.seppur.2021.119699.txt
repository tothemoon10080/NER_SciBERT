In mineral separation process, the heterocoagulation between mineral particles is extensive in both spontaneous (such as slime coating) and controlled processes (such as the carrier and coating methods). Various characterization techniques have been developed to provide better understanding of heterocoagulation mechanism. The paper reviews the characterization techniques of heterocoagulation between mineral particles, which are divided into indirect and direct ones. The working principle, consideration, merits and demerits of each technique are discussed in detail. Various characterization methods provide a wealth of options for the study of mineral heterocoagulation. Moreover, multiple characterization methods can be used together to verify each other in single study to enhance the persuasibility of the viewpoints. Developing in-situ and quantitative characterization techniques will further assist the fundamental understanding of heterocoagulation. Combining the heterocoagulation characterization results with the DLVO calculation results can provide complementary information and deep insights into the heterocoagulation mechanism between mineral particles.
