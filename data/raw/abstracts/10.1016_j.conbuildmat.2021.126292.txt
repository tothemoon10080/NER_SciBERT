This paper focused on the particle morphology of mineral filler and its effects on asphalt binder-filler interfacial interaction. The limestone, basalt, and granite fillers with various particle sizes were selected to prepare asphalt mastics. The relationship between morphological characteristics of mineral filler and asphalt binder-filler interfacial interaction was established. The results show that the angularity index and fractal dimension decrease while the form factor increase with the decreasing particle size. The granite filler particles demonstrated the higher morphological index values than the limestone and basalt ones. The K-B-G* value based on Palierne emulsion model exhibits the least susceptibility but strongest stability to filler particle size among the evaluation parameters studied. Form factor is the determining influential factor for asphalt binder-filler interfacial interaction, regardless of filler lithology. Furthermore, the packing characteristics of filler particles and the associated mastic morphologies could provide insight to possible relationship between particle morphology and interfacial behavior. All the results contribute to the selection of appropriate mineral filler to improve the asphalt binder-filler interfacial interaction and then the performance of asphalt mix system.
