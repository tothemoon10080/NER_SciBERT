Cr (VI) contamination has posed severe challenges to water quality, food safety, and land resources. Microbial reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) has drawn considerable attention due to its low cost and environmental friendliness. However, recent reports have shown that Cr(VI) generates highly migratable organo-Cr(III) rather than stable inorganic chromium minerals during the biological reduction process. In this work, it was reported for the first time that spinel structure CuCr2O4 was formed by Bacillus cereus in Cr biomineralization process. Different from known biomineralization models (biologically controlled mineralization and biologically induced mineralization), the chromium-copper minerals here appeared as specialized minerals with extracellular distribution. In view of this, a possible mechanism of biologically secretory mineralization was proposed. In addition, Bacillus cereus demonstrated a high conversion ability in the treatment of electroplating wastewater. The Cr(VI) removal percentage reached 99.7%, which satisfied the Chinese emission standard of pollutants for electroplating (GB 21,900â€“2008), indicating its application potential. Altogether, our work elucidated a bacterial chromium spinel mineralization pathway and evaluated the potential of this system for application in actual wastewater, opening a new avenue in the field of chromium pollution treatment and control.
