There are various types of polymetallic mineralization in lower Cambrian black shales from South China, including NiMo, Ba, P, and V deposits. However, the origin of this diverse mineralization is controversial, with debate existing as to whether seawater or hydrothermal fluids were more important. In addition, the effects of biological activity have also been proposed to be important. To assess these factors, we systematically compared the geological and mineralization characteristics of these deposits. The formation mechanisms of each deposit share common features, such as the ore-forming elements being supplied by hydrothermal fluids and seawater, and the role of biological activity in mineralization. However, there are also differences in the formation mechanisms of each deposit. We propose a genetic model involving three controls (seawater–hydrothermal fluids–biological activity) for the mineral deposits hosted in the black shales. Further research should focus on the multi-stage and complex ore-forming processes and, in particular, the role of biological activity in mineralization. This may have general significance for such deposits worldwide.
