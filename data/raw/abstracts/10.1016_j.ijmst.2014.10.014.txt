True triaxial rockburst experiments with four different unloading rates were performed on four prism specimens of granite sampled from Beishan, China. The damage evolution in the rockburst test was investigated from two aspects including fracture surface crack and fragment characteristics. The scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the micro crack information on fragment surface. Combing binarization and box counting dimensions, the fractal dimensions of cracks were obtained. Meanwhile, the fragments were collected and a sieving experiment was conducted. We weighed the fragments qualities, counted the amount of fragments and measured the fragments length, width and thickness. Utilizing four methods to calculate damage fractal dimensions of fragments, the trend of fractal value changing with unloading rates can be roughly described. It can be concluded from these experiments that the fractal dimension either for crack or for fragment holds a decreasing trend with the decreasing unloading rate, indicating a reduction of damage level.
