Mineral elements (Ca, Na, K, Mg, Zn, Ti, Sr, Fe, Ni, Ba, Cr, Mn, Cu, Se, Cd, Mo, B, V, As, Pb and Hg) in Provola cheeses obtained from dairy cows fed with two different integrated diets (Biotrak) and without olive cake (Control) were determined to discriminate between the two different cheeses. The results showed that cheeses from the Biotrak group presented higher values of essential elements. Selenium (Se) was found to be the most interesting: in Biotrak cheeses the content of Se was in the range of 0.112 to 0.281 mg/kg, about twice the content of Se in cheeses from the Control group. Among the toxic elements, only Cd was found in the samples, but at low levels (in average lower than 0.11 mg/kg). Therefore, the use of olive cake in animal feed is a good strategy to improve the mineral profile of the product obtained.
