Moreover, our findings provide valuable insights into the optimal mineralization temperatures for the simulated minerals, determining their dissolution or precipitation tendencies. Notably, calcite and dolomite exhibit higher mineralization efficiency at medium and lower temperatures, while minerals like illite, kaolinite, K-feldspar, and quartz are more favorably reactive at higher temperatures. Although porosity and pH exhibited minimal variations, they were sufficient to indicate the dynamics of mineral reactivity and mineralization trapping efficiency.
