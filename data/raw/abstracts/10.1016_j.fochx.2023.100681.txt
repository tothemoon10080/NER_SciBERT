The effects of different brewing water samples, including natural drinking water (NDW), pure water (PW), mineral water (MW), distilled water (DW), and tap water (TW) on flavor and quality of green tea infusion were investigated. The results showed the dissolution rate of mineral substances varied greatly depend on the type of water used. Notably, the tea infusion brewed with MW showed the highest taste response and darker but higher brightness in color. Furthermore, the content of volatile compounds was highest in tea infusion brewed with NDW and lowest in tea infusion brewed with MW. The mineral substances content and pH were the main factors affecting volatile compounds in green tea infusion. Thereinto, Ca2+ and Fe3+ remarkably affected the content of alcohols and aldehydes in volatile compounds. These results suggested that water with a neutral pH value and lower mineral substance content is more conducive for brewing green tea.
