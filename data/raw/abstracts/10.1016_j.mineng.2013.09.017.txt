Flotation recovery and selectivity problems have been reported in the flotation of fine sulphide minerals in gypsum supersaturated process water. In this study, the effect of gypsum supersaturated solution on the interactions between silica and sphalerite (ZnS) minerals was examined by observing deposition behaviour of silica nanoparticles on sphalerite surface using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D). Significant deposition of silica nanoparticles on ZnS coated sensor surface was observed in the gypsum supersaturated solution, indicating consequential slime coating of silica fines on sphalerite mineral surface. Substantial deposition of silica nanoparticles on SiO2 coated surface was also observed suggesting strong homo-aggregation of silica fines in the gypsum supersaturated solution. The interaction behaviour between silica–sphalerite and silica–silica is mainly attributed to the high calcium concentration of the gypsum supersaturated solution. Similar deposition behaviour of silica nanoparticles onto ZnS or SiO2 coated sensor surface was observed in 800ppm calcium solution, which is similar to the calcium concentration of the gypsum supersaturated solution. Colloidal force measurement between a silica particle and a fractured sphalerite surface or a silica wafer surface by an atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed attractive van der Waals force between the mineral particles in both gypsum supersaturated solution and 800ppm calcium solution. The high calcium concentration of the gypsum supersaturated solution induced the hetero-aggregation between silica and sphalerite, accounting for the observed decrease in flotation selectivity.
