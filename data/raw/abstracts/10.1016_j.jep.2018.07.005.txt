Ethnopharmacological relevance
                  The medicinal plant Sedum oxypetalum Kunth (Crassulaceae), locally known as Jiote or in general Siempreviva (always alive) has been traditionally used by people of the Mexican community of Tenango del Valle as a home remedy to treat periodontal diseases, inducing teeth strengthening. Consequently, the aim of this work was to investigate its capacity directed to mineralized tissues regeneration.
               
                  Materials and methods
                  The aerial parts of the plant were processed and its aqueous extract (AE) was chemically characterized. The AE and its components sedoheptulose and syngenite were tested for either osteogenic differentiation or mineral-nucleation induction respectively.
               
                  Results
                  The AE and one of its components (sedoheptulose) were shown to promote the proliferation and/or osteogenic differentiation by Human Periodontal Ligament-Derived Cells (hPDLs), while inducing the mineralization process. The AE also promoted the nucleation of octacalcium phosphate and its component syngenite, the hydroxyapatite crystals formation in vitro.
               
                  Conclusion
                  The findings reported herein support the traditional use of S. oxypetalum due to its potential capacity to promote the regeneration of mineralized tissues.
