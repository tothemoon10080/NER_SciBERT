d'Anterroches and Gani [1] have introduced the concept of process-group contributions for process flowsheet property estimation and process flowsheet synthesis and design. This concept has been highlighted through a flowsheet property model for distillation operations. In this work a group contribution model have been development for flowsheet properties for flotation circuit. The model was adjusted based on simulated values for a set of flotation circuits. This model will be the base for the development of a systematic strategy for computer aided mineral flow-sheet design, where modelling, synthesis and design are integrated tasks.
