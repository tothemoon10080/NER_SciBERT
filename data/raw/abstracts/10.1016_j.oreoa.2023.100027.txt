The Dharwar Craton (DC) is an archive containing a good proportion of ancient records of crustal evolution in its rocks. The greenstone-gneiss-migmatite and granitoid complex show significant variation in terms of time, space and mechanism of emplacement according to tectonics and geodynamic set up. The plutons of the northernmost part of Eastern Dharwar Craton (EDC) are especially recognizable from typical litho-structural attributes. The intensity of regional/burial metamorphism is negligible in these granitoids with versatile nature. Simple and composite plutons are demarcated on the basis of field association with distinguishable petro-mineralogy and geochemical characters. K-metasomatism in pluton is established from petrography with supportive geochemistry. Simple pluton is syenitic in nature unlike the composite plutons with lithological variation from Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite (TTG) to alkali feldspar granite. The granitoids are developed from crustal melting during the plate convergence. Post-orogenic nature of syenite is indicated from geochemical data. The sharp contact between the plutons and country rocks indicates significant temperature difference between country rocks and emplaced magma. The characteristic features like brittle deformation dominated structures, sharp contact between emplaced plutons and country rocks, very low grade of regional metamorphism, intensely differentiated nature and absence of diatexitic migmatite indicate a shallow crustal depth of plutonic emplacement. Higher concentration of large ion incompatible elements (e.g., U, Th, K) and associated high heat production imply shallow crustal segment with rocks derived from evolved differentiated magma. The study indicates a depth less than 8 km and temperature condition less than 250°C which correspond to epizone, where uranium remobilization is facilitated.
