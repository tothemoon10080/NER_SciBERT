This paper deals with the experimental study of the behaviour of creeping discharges on pressboard immersed in aged insulating liquids, in this case palm kernel oil methyl esters (PKOME) and mineral oil (MO). The results of the experiments show that the ageing of the PKOME and the MO results in an increase in the occupancy density and the maximum extension of the discharges. On the basis of the results obtained, it can be said that palm kernel oil methyl ester is a potential substitute for mineral oils in the event of depletion of fossil resources in the future.
