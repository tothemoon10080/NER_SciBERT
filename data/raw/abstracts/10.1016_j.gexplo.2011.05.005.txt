Geochemical exploration based on the analysis of indicator minerals (IMs) is becoming increasingly used as an effective method for mineral exploration for many types of mineral deposits. The types of IMs used or recommended for exploration for different types of deposits, their properties suitable for concentrating them, as well as those of other common minerals from which they must be separated are listed.
                  There is a variety of methods for the concentration and recovery of IMs from samples, but all have limitations as to the particle size range that can be treated with optimum results. The different processing methods available; the types of devices marketed; and their operational parameters are described. It is shown that due consideration to the limitations in particle size range that may be processed by these devices is required so as to avoid poor IMs recovery, possible unnecessary analytical costs, and obtaining chaotic or misleading results.
