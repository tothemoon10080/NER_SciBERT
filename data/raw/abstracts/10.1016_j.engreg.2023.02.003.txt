Mineral ions play a crucial role in various biological processes in the human body, particularly in bone repair and regeneration. Supplementation with mineral ions offers several advantages over other therapies or treatments for bone repair and regeneration, such as higher biosafety, universal applicability, and compatibility with the immune system. Additionally, supplementation with mineral ions may avoid the need for invasive surgical procedures. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the functions of potentially beneficial mineral ions and their effects on bone regeneration and osteoporosis treatment. By examining previous studies, including in vitro cellular experiments, in vivo animal models, and clinical trials, this review compares the benefits and potential adverse effects of these mineral ions. Moreover, the review provides guidelines for suggested daily supplementation of these mineral ions to assist future preclinical and clinical studies in bone regeneration and osteoporosis treatment.
