In order to compare the differences between variations of phosphate ore flotation collectors prepared by hogwash oils, JZQ-F collectors were prepared by the hydrolysis method using four types of hogwash oils from different regions in China. The components of the hogwash oils were determined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FIIR) spectra analysis, while the components of the JZQ-F were determined through gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The flotation effects of the JZQ-F collectors were investigated by flotation experiments and the adsorption characteristics were determined through the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM-D). Results show that the JZQ-F collector from the Ordos area has 27.43% unsaturated fatty acids. JZQ-F collectors from Beijing, Qingdao, and Dongguan areas contain over 62% of unsaturated fatty acids, which can acquire phosphorous concentrates with a the grade of P2O5 above 31.96% and the recovery higher than 91.52%. These three collectors have a larger adsorption capacity, faster adsorption rate, and stronger adsorption structure on apatite surface, which contributed to a good adsorption performance and a favorable flotation effect.
