The migration and transformations of Cd and As in soil are different, so it is difficult to simultaneously control them. In this study, an organo–mineral complex (OMC) material was prepared using modified palygorskite and chicken manure, the Cd and As adsorption capacities and mechanism of the OMC were explored, and the response of the crop to the OMC was clarified. The results show that the maximum Cd and As adsorption capacities of the OMC under pH values of 6–8 are 12.19 mg·g−1 and 5.07 mg·g−1, respectively. In the OMC system, the modified palygorskite contributed more to the adsorption of the heavy metals than the organic matter. Cd2+ may form CdCO3 and CdFe2O4, and AsO2
                     − may form FeAsO4, As2O3, and As2O5 on the surfaces of the modified palygorskite. Organic functional groups such as hydroxyl, imino, and benzaldehyde groups can participate in the adsorption of Cd and As. The Fe species and carbon vacancy in the OMC system promote the conversion of As3+ into As5+. A laboratory experiment was conducted to compare five commercial remediation agents with OMC. Planting Brassica campestris in the OMC remediated soil with excessive contamination increased the crop biomass and decreased the Cd and As accumulation sufficiently to meet the current national food safety standards. This study emphasizes the effectiveness of OMC in preventing the migration of Cd and As into crops while promoting crop growth, which can provide a feasible soil management strategy for CdAs co-contaminated farmland soil.
