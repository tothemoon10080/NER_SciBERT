Pseudoxanthoma elasticum, a heritable multisystem ectopic mineralization disorder, is caused by inactivating mutations in the ABCC6 gene. The encoded protein, ABCC6, a transmembrane transporter, has a specialized efflux function in hepatocytes by contributing to plasma levels of inorganic pyrophosphate, a potent inhibitor of mineralization in soft connective tissues. Reduced plasma inorganic pyrophosphate levels underlie the ectopic mineralization in pseudoxanthoma elasticum. In this study, we characterized the pathogenicity of three human ABCC6 missense variants using an adenovirus-mediated liver-specific ABCC6 transgene expression system in an Abcc6
                     
                        –/–
                      mouse model of pseudoxanthoma elasticum. Variants p.L420V and p.R1064W were found benign because they had abundance and plasma membrane localization in hepatocytes similar to the wild-type human ABCC6 transgene, normalized plasma inorganic pyrophosphate levels, and prevented mineralization in the dermal sheath of vibrissae in muzzle skin, a phenotypic hallmark in the Abcc6

                      mice. In contrast, p.S400F was shown to be pathogenic because it failed to normalize plasma inorganic pyrophosphate levels and had no effect on ectopic mineralization despite its normal expression and proper localization in hepatocytes. These results showed that adenovirus-mediated hepatic ABCC6 expression in Abcc6

                      mice can provide a model system to effectively elucidate the multifaceted functional consequences of human ABCC6 missense variants identified in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum.
