To interpret the well-known experimental fact of reducing the depth of GPR diagnostics of railway subgrades in arid regions, the properties of model samples of mineral compositions formed by adding gypsum to bentonite at low moisture were studied. Using electron microscopy, the microstructure of bentonite and the compositions of bentonite and gypsum were studied with various methods of introduction of gypsum. Dielectric permittivity is studied by the microwave resonance method in the GPR frequency range of 1200 - 1700 MHz. The influence of the interaction of water and gypsum, as well as the Maxwell-Wagner dielectric effect on dielectric permittivity of heterogeneous mineral compositions, depending on the concentration of the components, is estimated.
