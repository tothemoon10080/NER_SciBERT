Desalinated seawater often represents lack of merit nutrients, unstable and low buffer capacity owing to the fact that various aqueous ions are almost removed. The various re-mineralization processes, such as blending with surface water, chemicals dosing, and minerals dissolution, are commonly used for introduction of merit ions and carbonate alkalinity to desalinated seawater to meet health requirement and to protect water supply facilities from corrosion. This paper discusses the optimization of various re-mineralization processes based on accurate model computation with emphasis on carbonate system model, water stability index, blending model, and mineral surface dissolution model. The accurate model computation investigation justifies the efforts and costs through various re-mineralization processes for achieving narrow water quality criteria.
