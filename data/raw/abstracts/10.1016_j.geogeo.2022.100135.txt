The Kangdian region is an important U metallogenic belt in southwestern China and has global significance for investigations of Neoproterozoic U metallogenesis. In this study, we reviewed the findings of previous studies and determined that U mineralization is associated with high-grade metamorphic, Na-rich volcano-sedimentary, and low-grade metasedimentary ore-bearing rocks. Based on geochronology data, U mineralization in the Kangdian region occurred at 830-700 Ma. Neoproterozoic U mineralization in the Kangdian region has been attributed to the breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent. The mineralization is linked to magmatism that included a low degree of partial melting of U-rich basement in an extensional setting. Favorable Neoproterozoic geological and mineralization events in the Kangdian region produced U mineralization, which suggests that this region may contain U deposits. Therefore, studying Neoproterozoic U mineralization in the Kangdian region is important for enhancing the current understanding of the evolution of Rodinia with respect to global events and associated mineralization.
