Advanced oxidation processes (O3/UV and O3/H2O2) have been adopted for the treatment of mineral oil-contaminated wastewater. All the experimental runs have been performed in a 0.2-l semicontinuous reactor (equipped with a nominal power of 17W UV lamp for illuminated experiments). The results of this investigation show that the system O3/UV is capable of achieving high levels of purity ranging from 80 to 90% abatement of the inlet COD with reaction times not longer than 30min. Modeling of the reacting system has been also attempted to evaluate the rate parameters involved in some reaction steps. A preliminary estimation of the costs of adopted AOP techniques is provided.
