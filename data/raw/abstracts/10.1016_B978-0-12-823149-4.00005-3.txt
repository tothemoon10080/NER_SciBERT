Ilmenite is the source of titanium dioxide used in manufacturing pigments for paints, aerospace, and surgical industries. It is largely available worldwide as placer deposits with associated minerals of rutile, zircon, garnet, and sillimanite. South Africa and Australia are the major producers of ilmenite. Deposits are mined through dredging or dry mining operations. Various methodologies of mineral processing are being used for mining the ilmenite from the associated minerals. In this article, the authors discuss various methodologies of physical separation and flotation techniques for separating heavy minerals.
