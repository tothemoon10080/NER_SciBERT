The effect of the calcium sequestering salts (CSS) disodium phosphate (DSP), trisodium citrate (TSC) and sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP), pH (5.8 or 6.7), and heat treatment (90 °C for 5 min) on the solubilisation of individual caseins and minerals from 5% (w/w) rennet casein suspensions was studied. Levels of non-sedimentable caseins increased up to 150 mm DSP, 50 mm TSC and 10 mm SHMP, after which they plateaued or decreased. Higher levels of non-sedimentable caseins were found at pH 6.7 than at pH 5.8, whereas heating reduced levels of non-sedimentable caseins, Ca and P. Non-sedimentable Ca decreased with increasing level of DSP but increased with increasing level of TSC and SHMP. The results suggest different mechanism for different CSS; DSP may act through forming insoluble Ca-phosphate complexes, whereas TSC likely forms soluble Ca-citrate complexes and solubilises phosphate. SHMP likely cross-links caseins via calcium-casein phosphate complexes, enabling interaction with cations and caseins simultaneously.
