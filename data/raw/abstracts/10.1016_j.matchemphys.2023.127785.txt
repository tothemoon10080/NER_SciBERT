Eggshell powder (ESP) was explored as a selective heterogeneous catalyst for oxidative degradation of crystal violet (CV) dye in aqueous media in presence of H2O2 at room temperature. Natural but throw-away material ESP as a carbonate (CO3
                     2−) source facilitated the formation of carbonate anion radicals in presence of H2O2. Carbonate anion radicals (CO3

The reaction kinetics followed first order rate model. Intermediate products formed during CV degradation and the extent of mineralization were confirmed from MALDI-TOF-MS and TOC analysis, respectively. The turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) were obtained as 2.45 × 10−6 mol per g and 6.81 × 10−10 mol per g per second. A promising reusability was achieved up to seven cycles. The ESP catalyst used in this study was characterized by SEM, FTIR, XRD, XPS, BET surface area analysis, UV–visible DRS, XRF, and pHZPC analyses. The present work offers a novel facile but selective route for CV degradation and opens up newer possibilities for eggshell waste utilization as catalyst.
