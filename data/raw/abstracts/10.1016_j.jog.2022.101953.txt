Geophysical methods, especially the gravity method, are very helpful in ore and mineral explorations. Here, gravity modeling and interpretation for the subsurface geologic structures generally assumes either homogenous or spatially varying densities within target source rocks and surrounding structures. Therefore, the use of simple-geometric bodies helps in the validation of the subsurface ore and mineral targets. A Bat optimization algorithm is a recently developed metaheuristic algorithm that is used in various geophysical applications to explore and explain the parameters of buried ore and mineral targets. Using the Bat optimization algorithm, we were elucidating gravity anomaly profiles for ore and mineral cases. To perform global optimization, the Bat optimization algorithm is based on the echolocation behavior of bats. The global optimum solution in the Bat optimization algorithm reached the suggested minimum value of the objective function. The Bat optimization algorithm is applied to gravity data to estimate the target parameters (e.g., amplitude coefficient, depth, origin location, and geometric shape). The stability and efficiency of the introduced optimizing algorithm have been checked on two synthetic models represented in a spherical model and an infinitely horizontal cylinder model using two different kinds of noise. Furthermore, successful applications of the proposed algorithm for discovering the ore and minerals in Canada, Cuba, and India were presented. The results match well with the available geological and borehole information and other results from the published literature.
