Simulation is the process of designing a computerized model, of a system or procedure, for the purpose of understanding its behavior, and developing strategies to control its operation. Simulation models are rapidly becoming an effective tool for mineral processing plants. Powerful software and fast hardware are more readily available than a basic understanding of the theory of mathematical probability and applied statistics that process simulation models demand. Simple spreadsheet software can be used to develop simulation models that take into account any set of conditions at a mineral processing plant. In addition to the set of variables on which two- and three-product formulas are based, a reliable variance estimate for each variable is required. How to estimate variances, effectively and at the lowest possible cost, and how to compute the composite variances for compound measurements such as metal contents, are key elements for useful simulation models.
