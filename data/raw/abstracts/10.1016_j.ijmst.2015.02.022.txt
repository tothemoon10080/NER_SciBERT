                     . This paper summarized and compared 24 drag coefficient correlations, and developed an expression for calculating the terminal velocity in transitional flow, and also analyzed the effects of particle density and size, fluid density and viscosity on terminal velocity. The results show that 19 of 24 previously published correlations for drag coefficient have good prediction performance and can be used for calculating the terminal velocity in the entire transitional flow with higher accuracy.
