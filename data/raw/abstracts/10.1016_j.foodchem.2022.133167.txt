Chinese mitten crabs (Eriocheir sinensis), originating from Yangcheng Lake, are valuable aquatic products in China. To characterize changes in nutrients in this species in Yangcheng Lake during the year-round culture period, the contents of ten mineral elements in the third pereiopod were evaluated. Principal component analysis revealed that mineral elements changed substantially in the first three months. Thereafter, the elemental “fingerprint” stabilized, and samples could not be accurately distinguished. This pattern was supported by linear discriminant analysis and self-organizing map analysis. These results demonstrate that a long period of time is required for element characteristics to stabilize, suggesting that short-term breeding is insufficient to obtain the natural elemental “fingerprint.” In addition, our findings provide a basis for verifying the origin of Chinese mitten crab and other aquatic taxa in Yangcheng Lake.
