Proximate and mineral composition of 30 different traditional and popular Indian foods, categorised as either ready-to-eat or easy-to-reconstitute or freeze dried products have been evaluated. Of the 30 products, the proximal score of eleven and mineral composition of two items have been reported recently, elsewhere. The various products employed for the present study include vegetable pulav, dehydrated pulses/curries, upma, mutton/chicken curry, which form part of main meals, and certain fruit beverage powders of pineapple, mangoes and grapes. All the products, tested for their shelf stability (minimum of 6–12 months at ambient conditions) and microbiological safety, have been found to provide approximately 350–660 kcals 100 g−1 (on moisture-free-basis), depending on the type of product. The pulse, meat/chicken items were found to be protein-rich. Fat content in all the products varied, depending on the amount of hydrogenated oil used in their preparations. However, the fruit-based products contained negligible amounts of both protein and fat. The various minerals and trace elements analysed, include sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminium and lead. The elemental composition of each of the products varied with the different ingredients going into their preparation. However, it is noteworthy, that contaminants such as lead and aluminium are present in quantities well below the limits prescribed by standard institutions such as PFA and ASC. The nutrient database generated hitherto, while suggesting that the products are nutritionally good/safe, also enables nutrient-labelling of the products. Further, it helps the nutritionists and food planners to formulate different diets to meet the varied needs of the consumer.
