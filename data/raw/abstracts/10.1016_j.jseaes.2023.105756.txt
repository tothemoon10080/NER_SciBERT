Gold deposits involving multiple stages of mineralization have received considerable attention, but the relationship between these Au enrichment episodes remains enigmatic. The Changshagou Au deposit in the Chinese Tianshan Orogenic Belt exhibits two contrasting styles of mineralization. Early stockwork disseminated sulfide mineralization is associated with potassic alteration and acid magmatic fluids (log fO2 = -30 to -25, pH = 3 to 6), whereas late auriferous vein mineralization is associated with silicification and weakly alkaline hydrothermal fluids (log fO2 = -35 to -32, pH = 4 to 8). Early mineralization (average Au grade = 1.8 g/t) is dominated by invisible gold in sulfides, whereas late mineralization (average grade = 3.7 g/t) contains abundant native gold (fineness = 799 to 872). Fluids with high Au solubilities (∼104 ppb) from the late-stage mineralization remobilized pre-existing Au and formed As-enriched overgrowth bands on pyrite, with the core of these pyrite containing up to 1800 ppm Au, but little As, and their rim containing up to 4300 ppm As, but little Au. Subsequent fluid boiling accompanied with the escape of CO2 and H2S elevated the pH and redox state of the fluid (log fO2 = -32 to -28, pH > 8), which caused a decrease in Au solubilities and precipitation of native gold (average grade = 28.6 g/t). In summary, we suggest the Changshagou Au deposit formed as a result of three key processes — pre-enrichment, re-mobilization, and re-enrichment — all of which are important to the formation of Au deposits characterized by multiple stages of mineralization.
