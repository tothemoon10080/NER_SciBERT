Combining lithium real-time series data with recently developed advanced Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Facebook Prophet (Fb-P) algorithms is of particular relevance for identifying and delivering policy-insightful patterns by learning from experimental data without being pre-conditioned and managing investment risk. The prime objective of this study is to forecast lithium mineral resource prices in China. This study uses the Fb-P and ANN techniques to estimate lithium prices utilizing daily historical data between 5 November 2018 and 1 November 2022. In doing so, the empirical estimates help to predict future prices until 20 April 2023. The findings of the Facebook Prophet technique demonstrate that lithium mineral pricing has a very high degree of accuracy and has a long short-term memory at differential frequency days intervals. In contrast to the current price of 572,500 yuan/tonne, it may have been noticed that the market would suddenly surge in the next six months, reaching more than 800000 yuan/tonne. The study attempts to draw novel implications in the context of mineral resource prices in China.
