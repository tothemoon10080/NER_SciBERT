A novel insight into the nutritional changes of Tilapia fillets due to heat treatments was provided by evaluating the influence of baking and air-frying on the total mass fraction and bioaccessibility of micronutrients Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, P, S and Zn. A static in vitro model was used to simulate the human gastrointestinal digestion and then quantify the analytes using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry with a synchronous vertical dual view system (SVDV ICP OES). Unlike recent studies focusing on the mineral content of cooked foods, we interpreted the results more accurately by considering the weight yield factors. Compared with the raw sample, the baking and air-frying procedures significantly increased the total mass fraction of Fe. Air-frying promoted a slight decrease in Zn content. Bioaccessibility results ranged from 12–31% to 86–88% for Zn and K, respectively. Both heat treatments appear to increase the bioaccessibility of Mg, Fe, and Zn, whereas the other evaluated micronutrients were not remarkably affected by cooking. In addition, the SVDV mode was an efficient instrumental strategy for determination of total, bioaccessible, and non-bioaccessible fractions of essential minerals in Tilapia, improving the sample throughput.
