This paper discusses recent developments in instrumentation and control strategies for mineral processing. Particular emphasis will be given to milling, leaching, and flotation processes. The application of Al and expert systems in this industry are also reviewed.
                  In particular, the application of multivariable control to run-of-mine milling, the use of cyclone-underflow measurements, and a new optimization strategy based on mill-filling and the manipulation of mill-water addition will be reviewed.
                  In flotation, a new interface-detector system, which is particularly suitable for deep froth operations, will be discussed, and the further use of the scanned signal will be examined. The use of electrochemical measurements will also be reviewed.
                  A process-control study of the leaching and adsorption process has identified the important parameters that need to be measured and controlled. New measurement techniques which concern the measurement of leaching reagents and the adsorption media will be discussed, and their role in process control will be highlighted.
