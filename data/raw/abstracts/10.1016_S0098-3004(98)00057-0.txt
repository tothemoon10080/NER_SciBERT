This paper shows an application of energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) for digital acquisition of multi-element X-ray compositional maps of minerals in polished thin sections. A square matrix of n EDS spectra with known X, Y coordinates is collected, converted and exported to a personal computer. Each spectrum of the matrix is processed and the apparent concentration of each analyzed element is calculated by means of PETROMAP, a program written in Quick-Basic which applies a quantitative ZAF/FLS correction. The results of processing are comparable to the conventional quantitative microprobe analyses, with similar counting statistics. The output is a numerical matrix, compatible with the most popular graphic and spreadsheet programs from which it is possible to produce two-dimensional wt% oxide, mole fractions and mineral end-members pseudocolored or black/white maps. The procedure has been tested using a metamorphic garnet of the medium-grade Stilo unit (Calabrian Arc, Southern Italy).
