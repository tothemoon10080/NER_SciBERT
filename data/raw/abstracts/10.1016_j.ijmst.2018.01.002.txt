The gap of energy efficiency of eastern and central mining cities in China continues to expand, getting more attention from relevant departments. In this work, 20 mining cities in Eastern and Central China from 2010 to 2014 have been selected as research samples using data envelopment analysis (DEA). Research results show that the level of energy efficiency in mining cities is still low. China is in an extensive economic growth mode with high input, high consumption, low output and low efficiency. Mining cities in China have a huge potential to conserve energy and reduce emissions. China should optimize industrial structures, strengthen scientific and technological input and innovation, as well as implement energy-saving emissions reductions, and increase investment in environmental protection and ideological propaganda.
