Resource minerals are necessary natural resources for developing renewable energy (RE) sources. The differing capabilities of various countries significantly impact the growth of RE. Minerals are used more intensively in producing RE than fossil fuel-based energy. Data from 30 provinces in China from 2000 to 2019 were used to determine the effects of mineral resource trade on RE development. We analyzed China's mineral trade network and topological properties using a complex network technique. Mineral trade patterns affect RE development and how technological advancements in RE mediate the impact on the dynamic econometric model. The energy mix should depend more on RE, and the reprocessing rate of minerals should be higher to demonstrate that RE capacity investments are made. Export strength and key influences benefit RE growth. Results concluded that the presence of other well-known elements that determine optimal resource use, such as increased renewable sector productivity and suboptimal substitution between the two energy sources, gently curved the extraction costs for mineral resources.
