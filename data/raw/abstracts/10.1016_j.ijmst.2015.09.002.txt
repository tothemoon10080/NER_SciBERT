This paper reviews rare earth minerals (monazite and xenotime) separation by flotation. A wide range of monazite and xenotime flotation test results are summarized including: reasons of variation in the point of zero charges on these minerals, the effects of various flotation conditions on zeta potential of monazite and xenotime, interactions of collectors and depressants on the surface of these minerals during flotation separation, relationship between surface chemistry of the minerals and different types of collector adsorptions and effects of the conditioning temperature on flotation of rare earth minerals. This review collects various approaches for the selective separation of monazite and xenotime by flotation and gives perspectives for further research in the future.
