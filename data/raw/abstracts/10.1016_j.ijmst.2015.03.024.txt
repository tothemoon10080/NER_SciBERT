The section shape of an assembled magnetic medium is the most important structural parameter of a high gradient magnetic separator, which directly affects the induction distribution and magnetic field gradient of the magnetic separator. In this study, equilateral triangle, square, hexagonal, octagon, dodecagon, and round shape sections of the assembled magnetic medium are chosen to study their influence on magnetic field distribution characteristics using the ANSYS analysis. This paper utilizes a single assembled magnetic medium to understand the relationship between the geometry of the assembled magnetic medium and its magnetic field distribution characteristics. The results show that high magnetic field, regional field, magnetic field gradient, and magnetic force formed by the different sections of the assembled magnetic medium in the same background magnetic field reduce in turn based on the triangle, square, hexagonal, octagon, dodecagon, and round. Based on the magnetic field characteristics analytic results, the magnetic separation tests of the ilmenite are carried out. The results indicate that the section shape of the toothed plate compared with the section shape of cylinder can improve the recovery of ilmenite up to 45% in the same magnetizing current condition of 2 A, which is consistent with magnetic field characteristics analysis of different assembled magnetic medium section shapes.
