What is meant by quantum image processing? Prior to answering this question, the basis of quantum computing must be understood. Many academic institutions deal with mineral image processing as software that facilitates obtaining results without a perfect understanding of how the image processing algorithms are operating. In this view, if the same algorithm is applied in a certain area, it will deliver different results in different other areas. This is considered as uncertainty in applying the same algorithm. Many academic institutions are practicing this sort of uncertainty research and education, especially in the nations that are trying to occupy advanced world-educational ranks.
               This chapter demonstrates a novel algorithm of quantum automaton for automatic detection of hydrocarbon microseepage and the altered minerals such as ferrous iron, calcite, silt clay, and kaolinite. The main speculation used in this investigation is that there is a correlation between SAR image backscatter and mineral dielectric constants, in which every mineral has its own dielectric constant. In this understanding, these physical properties of different minerals can be determined and clustered using quantum automaton. Consequently, quantum automaton delivers an excellent promise in hydrocarbon microseepage exploration in the SAR-polarized VH image.
