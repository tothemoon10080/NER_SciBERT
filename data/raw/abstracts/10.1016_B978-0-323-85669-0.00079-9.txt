Interfacial water structure plays an important role in mineral flotation and many other separation processes. This chapter focuses on the interplay of interfacial water in flotation as revealed by sum-frequency generation spectroscopy (SFG). It provides microscopic details about the interfacial water structure and the surfactant adsorption at the mineralâ€“water interface, which affects the flotation efficiency significantly. These experimental results in conjunction with theories can help to quantify the hydrophobic or hydrophilic effects in flotation, especially for oxides, silicates, and fluoride minerals. Challenges and opportunities of applying the SFG in this research area are discussed.
