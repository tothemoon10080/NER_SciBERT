In the present study, the oil miscibility and displacement of CO2/oil systems in nanoslits referred to three minerals (e.g., quartz, calcite and kaolinite) were characterized by molecular dynamics simulations. First, the mode of oil migration was identified to be affected by the difference in the interaction between CO2/C10 and solid surface. In the meantime, we recognized that the stability of displacement front was critical to ensure the smooth migration of oil phase. Besides, the oil molecules were more likely to undergo two-way mass transfer between oil and gas in the multi-component system. Nevertheless, the oil phase exhibited obviously poor mobility and higher viscosity in dynamic system, thereby inhibiting the oil phase that contained multi-components from being displaced and detached. Overall, the study highlights the effect of mineral types and oil components on the oil miscibility and displacement in CO2 flooding, which probably boosting the development of low permeability reservoirs.
