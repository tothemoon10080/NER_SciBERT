The authors present the results of analysis of material composition and experimental investigations of acid and biohydrometallurgical leaching of middlings on grain size, pH level, leaching process duration, temperature and slurry density. The rational parameters of flotation and acid-bacterial leaching of middlings providing an efficient release of valuable components from mineral complexes and recovery to flotation concentrate and leaching solution have been determined. A combined flowsheet and a beneficiation process for bulk flotation middlings of copper–molybdenum ore have been suggested, which include middlings grinding, sulfide minerals flotation, bacterial leaching of sulfide flotation tailings, liquid-phase extraction of dissolved copper and electrolysis of re-extraction eluates. The suggested combined method of cleaning of middlings of copper–molybdenum ores beneficiation provides the total copper recovery increase by 0.8% with a reduction of the cost price of saleable material by 0.5%.
