Development of optimum wear-resistant materials relies on design of the total tribosystem based on the mechanical, chemical and thermal demands of the triboenvironment. Further material refinement is based on knowledge of the wear and degradation mechanisms, with material parameters such as composition and microstructure becoming vitally important. Wear-resistant metallic and elastomeric materials developed or adapted for use in the mining and mineral processing industries are reviewed. Tailoring composition and morphology of white cast irons and elastomers such as natural and synthetic rubbers and polyurethanes is described. Performance of metals and elastomers in corrosive-wear environments is compared. Translation from product specification data sheets (hardness, tensile strength, DIN or ASTM abrasion resistance) to field wear performance is discussed. The effect of tribosystem design on wear rate is emphasized.
