This paper describes the deep rockburst simulation system to reproduce the granite instantaneous rockburst process. Based on the PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) technique, quantitative analysis of a rockburst, the images of tracer particle, displacement and strain fields can be obtained, and the debris trajectory described. According to the observation of on-site tests, the dynamic rockburst is actually a gasâ€“solid high speed flow process, which is caused by the interaction of rock fragments and surrounding air. With the help of analysis on high speed video and PIV images, the granite rockburst failure process is composed of six stages of platey fragment spalling and debris ejection. Meanwhile, the elastic energy for these six stages has been calculated to study the energy variation. The results indicate that the rockburst process can be summarized as: an initiating stage, intensive developing stage and gradual decay stage. This research will be helpful for our further understanding of the rockburst mechanism.
