Understanding the various ash transformation properties is vital for improving gasification behavior and optimizing industrial operation conditions during the gasification-melting process of biomass wastes. In this work, five typical biomass wastes were selected to investigate the slag property. The ash fusion process, mineral transformation and AAEMs solidification behaviors were performed and predicted by mineral transformation analysis and thermochemical calculation. The results indicated that ash fusion process contained sintering, swelling, bubbling and melting stages, which was related to ash chemical compositions. Besides, the ash flow temperature had a linear relationship with the basic-to-acid ratio of biomass waste ashes. High SiO2 content would lead to strong mineral crystallinity at high temperatures. The mineral transformation was also highly related to ash compositions. The complicated reactions of inorganic matters occurred when SiO2 content lied between 50 wt% and 70 wt%. For AAEMs solidification, the alkali was prone to react simultaneously with both SiO2 and Al2O3 to form eutectoid, and the range of 35–65 wt% for SiO2 + Al2O3 contents was beneficial for alkali solidification. All the obtained data was meaningful to provide a modifying reference for the efficient and clean utilization of various biomass wastes during gasification process.
