Chemical-flooding schemes for recovering residual oil have been in general less than satisfactory due to loss of chemicals by adsorption on reservoir rocks, precipitation, and resultant changes in rock wettability. Adsorption and wettability changes are determined mainly by the chemical structure and mix of the surfactants, surface properties of the rock, composition of the oil and reservoir fluids, nature of the polymers added and solution conditions such as salinity, pH and temperature. The mineralogical composition of reservoir rocks plays an important role in determining interactions between reservoir minerals and externally added reagents (surfactants/polymers) and their effects on solidâ€“liquid interfacial properties such as surface charge and wettability. Some of the reservoir minerals can be sparingly soluble causing precipitation and changes in wettabilty as well as drastic depletion of surfactants/polymers.
                  Most importantly, the effect of surfactants on wettability depends not only how much is adsorbed but also on how they adsorb. A water wetted rock surface that is beneficial for displacement of oil can be obtained by manipulating the orientation of the adsorbed layers. New surfactants capable of tolerating harsh conditions created by extremes of pH, temperature or inorganics and capable of interacting favorably with inorganics and polymers are promising for enhanced oil recovery. In this regard, such surfactants as sugar based ones and pyrrolidones are attracting attention, as they are also biodegradable. In many cases, mixed surfactants perform much better than single surfactants due to synergetic effects and ability to alleviate precipitation. Also, addition of inorganics such as silicates, phosphates and carbonates and polymers such as lignins can be used to control the adsorption and the wettability. In this paper, use of specialty surfactants and their mixtures is discussed along with the mechanisms involved.
