Luohe is the largest IOA-type deposit in the Middle and Lower reaches of the Yangtze Metallogenic belt. The iron ore body is hosted in thick volcanic rocks, and widespread acidic alteration (secondary quartzite) developed at shallow depths, providing an excellent opportunity to study the genesis of acidic alteration rocks and the genetic links with the IOA mineralization. In this study, detailed mineralogy, in situ sulfur isotopes, and trace element analyses were performed on pyrite from a shallow drill hole in the Luohe deposit. The results indicate that the formation time of acidic alteration is between magnetite (stage II) and anhydrite-pyrite (stage IV), with pyrite sulfur isotopes ranging from −14 to 4‰, which is significantly different from those in stage IV (7-9‰). The anomaly negative sulfur isotope suggests the existence of SO2 disproportionation reaction, and the δ34S of pyrite increases with depth decrease, ultimately falling within the mantle sulfur range. This indicates that the sulfur origin of acidic alteration pyrite is a single magma sulfur source, which is significantly different from the deep iron mineralization system (magmatic + evaporite). The trace elements Co, Ni, As, Ti, Cu, Sb, Tl in pyrite indicate that the acidic alteration fluid has the characteristics of low temperature, low pH, and is rich in F and Cl. Combined with the sulfur isotope results, it is believed that pyrite in the acidic alteration rock of the Luohe was formed by the mixing of gaseous SO2 and shallow groundwater, which is a part of the Luohe magmatic-hydrothermal mineralization system and an important indication for regional exploration of similar deposits.
