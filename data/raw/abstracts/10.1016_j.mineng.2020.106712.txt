Mineral carbonation for global warming mitigation has attracted worldwide attention. The combination of mineral processing for primary metal recovery and mineral carbonation for carbon sequestration is an emerging field of study with the potential to minimize capital costs. A quantified kinetic formula of mineral carbonation was tested for application to various natural silicate samples. Our research confirms the optimized kinetic formula can be successfully applied to predict mineral carbonation of various natural silicate samples within absolute 4% precision. The kinetic factor is exponentially dependent on the activation energy of carbonation of natural silicate samples. The application of the kinetic formula is restricted to a mineral carbonation process under chemical reaction control. The successful application is not affected by mineral compositions, olivine content, mineral carbonation capacity, specific surface area, particle size distribution, temperature, CO2 partial pressure or concentration of sodium bicarbonate in solution. This quantified kinetic formula can predict mineral carbonation efficiency for an integrated process of mineral processing and mineral carbonation.
