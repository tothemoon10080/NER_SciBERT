We describe the basics of dietary reference values in terms of their usage. We also describe the different ways in which vitamin and mineral status can be comprised. Guidelines for the intake of the minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, zinc, copper, manganese, copper, and selenium across age ranges are presented. Guidelines for vitamins are also presented. We speculate on different scenarios whereby micronutrient status may be at risk and the dilemmas for the attending physicians in assessing either gross nutritional or micronutrient status.
