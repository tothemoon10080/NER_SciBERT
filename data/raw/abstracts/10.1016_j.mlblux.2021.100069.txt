Biomineralization refers to the process of functional minerals biosynthesis in organisms. This study introduced artificial mineralization operations on human oocytes and performed micromorphological and material studies. The folic acid and a cationic polymer were used to achieve in-situ mineralization on zona pellucida surface through CaP precipitation reaction. After reaction, many mineral crystals were observed and self-assembled on the surface of zona pellucida to form a calcium phosphate-derivative mineralized shell with porous structure. This study suggests that, biomineralization with useful biological modifications in human oocytes may provide novel therapeutics such as sustained drug release for improving embryonic development and implantation potential in future.
