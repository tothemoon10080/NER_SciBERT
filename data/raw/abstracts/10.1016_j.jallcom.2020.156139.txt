There are many applications of TiO2 such as paints and plastics due to its excellent properties such as high whiteness and strong hiding power. To eliminate the pollution in the producing process as well as reduce the cost, the mineral-TiO2 composites were developed in the past few decades, which also have similar or even better properties compared with the pure TiO2. This review attempts to provide a comprehensive summary and update of the fabrication methods of producing mineral-TiO2 composites. We divide the fabrication methods into three categories, namely chemical precipitation method, mechano-chemical method and self-assembly method. Other fabrication methods are also introduced. We then enumerate the wide range of new applications of mineral-TiO2 composites, especially as pigments in paints, papermaking and plastics. The mineral-TiO2 composites will be developed deeply both in academic area and in industry field.
