Earth is the primary source of some of man's most treasured gems and since antiquity, humans have used gem materials excavated from the Earth as decorative objects and for personal adornment. Diamond, ruby, sapphire, aquamarine, emerald, topaz, opal, and amethyst are well-known gem minerals, although theoretically any of the more than 5500 known mineral species may be fashioned into a gem provided certain physical and optical properties (e.g., adequate size, visually attractive, durable, and general rarity) that give them value are met. Gem materials, in this case naturally occurring minerals or rocks, form by igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic processes at near-surface environments to deep within the Earth. Exceptional chemical, thermobarometric and physical conditions are required for the growth of gem-quality mineral crystals which can subsequently be shaped and polished to create a gemstone. A variety of treatment techniques are often applied to non-perfect gem materials to enhance their appearance and make them more economically desirable. The mining methods of gem minerals are as varied as the type of gem deposit (e.g., volcanogenic, pegmatite, skarns, placers) in which they are found. Surface and underground mining techniques are both used where the gem material is extracted by hand or by heavy machinery. Minerals that lack the physical and optical properties desirable for use as gem material may still find value as raw materials used for manufacturing consumer goods or as tools that aid in understanding the processes that shape our dynamic Earth.
