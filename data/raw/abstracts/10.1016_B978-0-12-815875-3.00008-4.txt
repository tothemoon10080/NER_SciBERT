Magnetic nanoparticles consisting of magnetite (Fe3O4) are promising therapeutic and/or diagnostic tools in medicine. In this chapter, the ball milling processing of natural mineral magnetite for medical applications is described. The chapter is focused on the preparation of bifunctional materials where magnetic component (Fe3O4) is combined with fluorescent (ZnS) and therapeutic (As4S4) entities. The properties of the prepared powder materials including microstructure characterization are described in details. Subsequently, the coating with biocompatible surfactants is presented. The physico-chemical properties including stability are also demonstrated. Finally, the possibilities of up-scaling the process is described referring to the latest knowledge regarding to this issue.
