In order to reduce the hazard of coal spontaneous combustion, the cross-linking reaction between O-containing functional groups of coal should be inhibited. So the inhibitory effect of an ionic liquid (IL) on the cross-linking reaction was studied. The O-containing functional groups change the weight loss and H2O, CO2, CO yields of bituminous coal before and after [HOEmim][BF4] and [Amim]Cl pre-treatment and were detected by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Thermo Gravimetric (TG) analysis. The results show that [Amim]Cl has a weaker ability to inhibit the cross-linking reaction of bituminous coal compared to [HOEmim][BF4]. Besides, based on Quantum Chemistry calculation, it was found that the different inhibiting effects of [HOEmim][BF4] and [Amim]Cl are greatly related to their anions and the H linked with C2 atom on the imidazole ring. The H-donor ability of coal will be enhanced by [HOEmim][BF4] leading to a weaker cross-linking reaction of coal.
