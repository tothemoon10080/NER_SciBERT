The Archean greenstone belt occupying the Dhanjori basin is a potential target for exploring resources of various precious metals and sulfide minerals like other Precambrian greenstone belts. Thick alluvium cover and limited outcrops in the survey area pose challenges in mineral exploration strategies. This work presents an integrated study of petrophysics, petrography and geophysics (gravity and magnetic survey) over an identified conductor in the western margin of the Dhanjori basin, which aims to delineate anomalous sulfide-bearing zones. The present analysis of petrophysical parameters (bulk density, and volume magnetic susceptibility) of various litho-units including dolerite, metabasalt, magnetite, chert and metasediments (quartzite and quartz pebble conglomerate (QPC)) indicate the occurrences of sulfide minerals. Petrographic studies of the smoky and fuchsitic quartzites also suggest sulfide mineral phases (chalcopyrite, and pyrite). EPMA studies on these metasediments reveal the presence of sulfide minerals (pyrite, chalcopyrite, millerite, bornite and pyrrhotite) and sulfosalts (gersdorffite, and cobaltite), along with traces of gold and silver. The 3D inversion of gravity and magnetic data identified significant geophysical signatures corresponding to possible subsurface sulfide mineralization and have helped in the reduction of the target area. This work also demonstrates the utility of integrated investigations in identifying deep-seated mineralization, which may be helpful in exploring analogous prospective Precambrian greenstone belts.
