The effects of processing with alkaline salts, kanwa and sodium bicarbonate, on some quality attributes and mineral contents of cowpea seeds were investigated. Analysis included objective measurements of texture and colour, cooking time, water absorption, leached solids, pH, proximate composition and minerals in treated and control beans. Cooking with kanwa or sodium bicarbonate by normal boiling increased softness, water absorption, solid loss, pH and mineral content of the beans but decreased cooking time and produced dark coloured beans. Kanwa gave greater increases in some minerals and caused more darkening in the cooked product than cooking in sodium bicarbonate. Pressure cooking beans in the alkaline solutions produced lighter and yellow coloured samples, caused greater increases in softness and water absorption than atmospheric boiling and also affected the mineral content of the beans. There were small changes in the proximate composition of the cooked beans.
