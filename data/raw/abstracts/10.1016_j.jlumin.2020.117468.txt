Sm3+-doped β-dicalcium silicate (β-Ca2SiO4: Sm3+) was resoundingly prepared by the traditional high-temperature solid-state reaction method. The crystal structure, morphology and composition of β-Ca2SiO4: Sm3+ before and after mineralization was characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), respectively. The luminescence properties of β-Ca2SiO4: Sm3+ before and after mineralization were investigated by luminescence spectroscopy. The results show that Sm3+ ion has the effect of stabilizing β-Ca2SiO4 and β-Ca2SiO4: Sm3+ has good biological activity and can be converted to hydroxyapatite (HA) in simulated body fluid. Meanwhile, with the prolongation of mineralization time, the luminescence intensity of Sm3+ ion decreased gradually, and the CIE chromaticity coordinates moved from orange region to yellow green region. This suggests that the evolution of luminescence properties can be used as an obvious qualitative feature to monitor the mineralization process of β-Ca2SiO4: Sm3+.
