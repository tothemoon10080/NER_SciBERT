Microalgae are one of the most auspicious sustainable sources of food ingredients, bioactive compounds, and nutraceuticals due to their biomass composition. Thus, knowing their chemical properties is crucial for species choice, possible applications, nutritional and health benefits, and ensuring consumer safety. The mineral content is a significant fraction of the microalgal biomass and can represent from 2% to 40% of its dry weight. This way, the central objective of this chapter is to provide an overview of the major minerals, trace elements, and heavy metals found in microalgae biomass, as well as a brief review of the analytical methods used to determine such compounds.
