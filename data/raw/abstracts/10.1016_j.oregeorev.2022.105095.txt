Base metal mineralization at the Baal Gammon and Isabel deposits of the Herberton Mineral Field (HMF) is hosted in metamorphosed greywacke beds in the Hodgkinson Formation, which were intruded by granite, porphyry dykes and overlain by volcanic rocks of the Kennedy Igneous Association during the Carboniferous and Permian. The tin mineralization at the Baal Gammon deposit is hosted by a silicified, chlorite-altered, quartz-feldspar porphyry (UNA Porphyry). The tin mineralization at the Isabel deposit is in polymetallic veins hosting disseminated cassiterite. Polymetallic sulfides (Cu-Zn) and indium (In) mineralization at both deposits overprint the tin mineralization. Chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and stannite host indium in the polymetallic sulfide assemblage at both deposits. Based on overprinting relationships, the timing of tin mineralization is related to the magmatic activity at ca. 320 Ma, whereas the sulfide and indium mineralization are most likely associated with the emplacement of porphyry dykes at ca. 290 Ma. The overall magmatic activity in the HMF spreads between ca. 365 and 280 Ma, with peaks at ca. 337, 322, 305, and 285 Ma. The change from tin mineralization at ca. 320 Ma to sulfide and indium mineralization at ca. 290 Ma indicates a transition from a compressive to an extensional tectonic regime.
