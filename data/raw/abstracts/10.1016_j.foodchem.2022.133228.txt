This paper describes studies for the determination of total concentration and bioaccessible fraction of minerals in peaches by MIP OES. The PCA analysis identified 3 distinct groups of elements concerning the total concentration, which was attributed to the origin of each cultivar. Among the macroelements, K presented higher values for total concentration, while B and Fe predominated among the microelements. Regarding the bioaccessible fraction, Mn presented the highest percentage (46–84%), followed by Zn and B (10–63% and 33–57%, respectively). Pearson's correlation coefficient revealed that reducing sugars and titratable acidity can influence the mineral bioaccessibility, highlighting the strong positive correlations between reducing sugars with Mn and total acidity with Fe. Peach cultivars have satisfactory nutritional value, but the total and bioaccessible concentrations of minerals obtained do not meet the recommended daily needs, requiring the consumption of other fruits and vegetables to complement the diet.
