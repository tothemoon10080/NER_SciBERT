As a new bioremediation technology for toxic metals, microbiologically induced calcite precipitation (MICP) is gradually becoming a research focus. This study investigated the application of MICP to mineralize toxic metals (lead and cadmium) in landfill leachate for the first time. In the experiment of remediating synthetic landfill leachate (SLL) contaminated by Pb2+, 100% of the 20 mg/L Pb2+ was removed when the maximum urease activity was only 20.96 U/ml. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and laser particle size characterizations of the precipitates indicate the formation of agglomerated square particles, 76.9% of which had sizes that ranged from 33.93 to 57.06 μm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic and X-ray diffraction analyses confirmed that the precipitates consisted predominantly of calcite crystals, and the unit cell lattice constants of the precipitates (a = b = 4.984 Å, c = 17.171 Å) matched those of calcite, while lead was fixed as hydrocerussite. In addition, the Pb-MICP precipitates were stable under continuous acid degradation (pH = 5.5), and only 1.76% of the lead was released after 15 days. In the verification test of toxic metals remediation in a real landfill leachate (RLL), all of the Pb2+ and Cd2+ (initial concentrations: Pb2+ = 25 mg/L; Cd2+ = 5.6205 mg/L) was mineralized simultaneously, which further confirmed the feasibility of MICP for toxic metal remediation in landfill leachate. However, optimizing the urea dosage and combining the ammonium recovery are necessary strategies required for improving the economic and environmental benefits of the MICP process.
