There is an increasing demand for solid industrial minerals worldwide, as countries seek to support their economic growth. Wase, situated in Plateau State, is notable for lead and zinc mineralisation due to tectonic and hydrothermal activities in the region. The study utilises geophysical surveys to map mineralised zones of lead-zinc occurrence. These include ground magnetic survey, very low frequency electromagnetic, electrical resistivity tomography, and induced polarisation (IP). The field data were acquired using a GEMSys Overhauser magnetometer with VLF option and ABEM LS 2 Terrameter. twenty-nine (29) magnetic profiles with 50m spacing and a total length of 24.0 km were obtained and fifteen (15) very low frequency electromagnetic (VLF-EM) profiles with 10 m spacing in the E-W direction. A total length of 12.5 km was acquired across target areas of the magnetic profiles. The multiple-gradient electrode array of the ERT/IP surveys was used for data acquisition, and RES2DINV software by Geotomo was used for the inversion of the acquired data. High chargeability values corresponding to low resistivity values characterised zones with suspected lead-zinc mineralisation. Following this preliminary finding, we advise that further trenching, pitting, or core drilling be carried out to ascertain ore grade, possible beneficiation, and estimate of the reserve.
