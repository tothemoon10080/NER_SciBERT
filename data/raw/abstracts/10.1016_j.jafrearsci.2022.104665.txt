In recent years, due to the high-reserve metallic and/or non-metallic mines detected in A-type granitoids, this interest is growing in these granitoids. Davulalan syenitoid is one of the A-type granitoids which are intruded in the Central Anatolian Crystalline Complex (CACC) in Turkey. This research discusses the ore productivity and fertility of the Davulalan syenitoid based on field studies, petrographic examinations, and geochemical data. The syenitoid consist of alkaline composition syenite and quartz-syenite, and calcic composition nepheline-syenite rocks. Two type mineral occurrences as vein and veinlets (stockwork) bearing Cu (up to 60 ppm), Mo (up to 308 ppm), Pb (up to 3600 ppm), Zn (up to 745 ppm), and REEs (up to 880 ppm), which are located in the center of the syenitoid and the contact zones of the marbles. As microscopically, argillization, sericitization, chloritization, carbonization, and silicification in the samples where are between the veins. The veins and veinlets include mainly galena, chalcopyrite, pyrite, native gold, magnetite, maghemite, specular hematite and hematite as ore minerals, and calcite, fluorite and quartz as gangue minerals. The geochemical data of unaltered/altered samples show tending to the K-feldspar and argillic/sericite alterations. Due to its similar to the Ocean Island Basalt (OIB) composition, strongly evolved and fractionated, likely high oxygen fugacity, the syenitoid a productive and fertility in terms of Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn, and REEs.
