As non-renewable natural resources, minerals are essential in a broad range of biological and technological applications. The surface interactions of mineral particles with other objects (e.g., solids, bubbles, reagents) in aqueous suspensions play a critical role in mediating many interfacial phenomena involved in mineral flotation. In this work, we have reviewed the fundamentals of surface forces and quantitative surface property-force relationship of minerals, and the advances in the quantitative measurements of interaction forces of mineral-mineral, bubble-mineral and mineral-reagent using nanomechanical tools such as surface forces apparatus (SFA) and atomic force microscope (AFM). The quantitative correlation between surface properties of minerals at the solid/water interface and their surface interaction mechanisms with other objects in complex aqueous media at the nanoscale has been established. The existing challenges in mineral flotation such as characterization of anisotropic crystal plane or heterogeneous surface, low recovery of fine particle flotation, and in-situ electrochemical characterization of collectorless flotation as well as the future work to resolve the challenges based on the understanding and modulation of surface forces of minerals have also been discussed. This review provides useful insights into the fundamental understanding of the intermolecular and surface interaction mechanisms involved in mineral processing, with implications for precisely modulating related interfacial interactions towards the development of highly efficient industrial processes and chemical additives.
