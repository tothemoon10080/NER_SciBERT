The irregular expression of bone matrix proteins occurring during the mineralization of bone regeneration results in various deformities which poses a major concern of orthopedic reconstruction. The limitations of the existing reconstruction practice paved a way for the development of a metal-organic composite [TQ-Sr-Fe] with Metal ions strontium [Sr] and iron [Fe] and a biomolecule Thymoquinone [TQ] in an attempt to enhance the bone mineralization due to their positive significance in osteoblast differentiation, proliferation and maturation. TQ-Sr-Fe was synthesized by in-situ coprecipitation and subjected to various characterization to determine their nature, compatibility and osteogenic efficiency. The crystallographic and electron microscopy analysis reveals sheet like structure of the composite. The negative cytotoxicity of TQ-Sr-Fe in the MG 63 cell line signified their biocompatibility. Cell adhesion and proliferation rate affirmed osteoconductive and osteoinductive nature of the composites and it was further supported by the gene expression of osteoblastic differentiation. The sequential expression of bone matrix proteins such as OCN, SPARC, COL 1, and Alkaline Phosphatase elevate the calcium deposition of MG-63 osteoblast like cells and initiates mineralization compared to control. Thus, the metal-organic composite TQ-Sr-Fe would make a suitable composite for accelerating mineralization process which would leads to faster bone regeneration.
