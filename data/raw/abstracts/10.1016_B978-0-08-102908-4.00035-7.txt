The mining and supply of metal and mineral resources are crucial for the operation of the modern world—energy, food, transport, telecommunications, infrastructure, etc. There are a variety of geological processes which lead to the formation of mineral deposits containing one or more metals or minerals of interest for mining. A mineral deposit is clearly finite in size, leading to the need to continually find more mineable deposits to continue to meet growing demands. Over time, the mining industry globally has been very successful in finding new deposits, developing new technologies for mining and ore processing, as well as combining these two to mine ever lower grades at existing deposits. Once mined, a metal or mineral is used in a product or service and is then either disposed of or recycled. The mining, use and disposal or recycling of resources is known as the “resource cycle.” As mining grows, so too do the environmental and social impacts—exemplified by declining ore grades, mountains of tailings and waste rock, risks to water resources, catastrophic failures, social issues, regulatory challenges, etc. There are a variety of increasingly supported frameworks to improve resource efficiency and lead to more sustainable environmental and social outcomes—including the circular economy, sustainability reporting, responsible certification and others. Whilst mineral deposits may be geologically finite, the modern world is not in danger of resource depletion but has to balance an increasingly complex set of often competing social, environmental and economic issues to ensure a more sustainable resource cycle.
