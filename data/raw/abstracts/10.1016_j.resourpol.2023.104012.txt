The paper examines the sustainable trade of mineral resources between China and 10 African Great Lakes economies (2010â€“2021) under trade gravity theory. Using PPML estimation, findings confirm that per capita income equality positively impacts the sustainable trade index. Geographical distance hampers sustainable trade, while trade uncertainty poses challenges. A rise in China's Yuan decreases the sustainable development index. Surprisingly, patents show no significant relation to sustainable trade. To enhance sustainable trade, recommended strategies include poverty alleviation, financial inclusion, green logistics investments, and promoting the green financing market beyond the region.
