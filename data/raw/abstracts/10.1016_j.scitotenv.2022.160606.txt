The increasing daily use of cosmetic and personal care ingredients (CPCIs) requires improved understanding of the fate and impacts of CPCIs in environmental systems. Effects of CPCIs on colloidal properties of various geocolloids such as iron oxides (goethite, haematite), clay minerals (kaolinite, bentonite) and soil clays (kaolinitic-, illitic- and lateritic soil clays) were studied by tracking time-resolved changes in zeta potential (ζ) and observing suspended particle density. Two polymers representing anionic CPCIs, i.e., polyacrylate crosspolymer-11 (PC11) and cationic CPCIs, i.e., polyDADMAC (PD) show contrast effects on ζ and colloidal properties of the selected materials. While PC11 tended to associate with Fe oxides, PD can be adsorbed by clay minerals and soil clays. The neutralization due to the sorption of either PC11 or PD onto opposite-charge sign surface sites can lower the net surface charge of the materials, thereby enhancing electrostatic attraction, stimulating particle size growth, and eventually intensifying co-aggregation. The observed colloidal properties of iron oxides, clay minerals and soil clays under the presence of PC11 and PD may reflect what are happening in many aquatic environments where CPCIs co-exist with various mineral colloids. Therein, CPCIs likely delay the transport of the opposite-charge sign colloids, while they increase the dispersibility and transportability of the same-charge sign colloids. This implies that intensifying presence of a given CPCI could have selective effects on colloid systems. As a whole, CPCIs can change the fate and the final destination of mineral colloids and themselves; therefore, their effects and relevant treatment techniques need to be included into the future agenda.
