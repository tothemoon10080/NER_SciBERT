Utilization of common beans is greatly hampered by the hard-to-cook (HTC) defect induced by ageing of the beans under adverse storage. Large bean-to-bean variations exist in a single batch of beans. Therefore, a texture-based bean classification approach was applied in this detailed study on beans with known textures, to gain in-depth insights into the role of the pectin-cation-phytate mechanism in relation to the texture changes during subsequent cooking of Red haricot fresh and aged beans. For the first time, a correlation between the texture (exhibited after cooking) of a single bean seed before ageing (fresh) and its texture after ageing was established. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM-EDS) based in situ cell wall associated mineral quantification revealed that the cell wall associated Ca concentration was significantly positively correlated with the texture of both fresh and aged cooked Red haricot bean cotyledons, with ageing resulting in a significant enrichment of Ca at the cell wall. These additional Ca cations originate from intracellular phytate hydrolysis during ageing, which was shown to affect the texture distribution of aged beans during cooking significantly. The relocation of the mineral cations from the cell interior to the cell wall occurs mainly during storage rather than subsequent soaking of the cotyledons. In addition, the pectin-cation-phytate hypothesis of HTC was further confirmed by demethylesterification of the cell wall pectin and increased pectin-Ca interactions upon ageing of the cotyledons, finally leading to HTC development of the cotyledon tissue.
