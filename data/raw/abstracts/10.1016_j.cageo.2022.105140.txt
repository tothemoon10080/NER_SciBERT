The support vector classifier (SVC) is one of the most powerful machine learning algorithms. This algorithm has been accepted as an effective method in three-dimensional geological modeling. Although the model selection has a great impact on the performance of SVC algorithm, most of mining studies have neglected it and used the grid search method. Therefore, in this study, a new approach is proposed for improving the selection of SVC models. This approach uses particle swarm optimization (PSO) to determine the important parameters of SCV such as penalty and kernel parameters. The proposed approach was applied in the modeling process of the Iju porphyry copper deposit to delineate alteration and mineralization zones. The optimal penalty and kernel parameters were found to be 27.2 and 2−4.75 for alteration zone, and 22.72 and 2−6.23 for mineralization zone, respectively. With 97.4% and 97.01% rates of accuracy for mineralization and alteration zones, the PSO results showed reasonable performance in classification. The proposed approach had better accuracy than grid search method. Therefore, because of its better performance, the geological models were developed using the PSO method to be used as a basis for future resource evaluation.
