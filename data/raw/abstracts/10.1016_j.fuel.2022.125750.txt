CO2 mineral sequestration is one of the most promising strategies for combating global warming, which is composed of direct and indirect pathways. However, the high cost and heat consumption for recycling reagents used in the indirect carbonation process is the biggest obstacle for its widespread applications. In this study, a novel process by using a solid waste, copperas, as reagent to extract magnesium and nickel from laterite ore was proposed for simultaneous CO2 mineralization and recovery of nickel. In this process, the copperas was decomposed into SO2, which sulfated the laterite ore by in situ gas–solid reaction. The addition of Na2SO4 facilitated the formation of low melting point substances, converting the gas–solid reactions into a multiphase gas–liquid-solid reaction, thus the extraction was enhanced. Meanwhile, the heat of sulfation of laterite ore can compensate the heat of copperas decomposition, reducing the overall energy consumption. The maximum extraction efficiency of 94 % for Mg and 87 % for Ni was achieved at Na2SO4 dosage larger than 10 wt%. The carbonation of MgSO4-riched leachate experiments revealed the optimal CO2 storage capacity was approximately 291 kg·t−1 laterite ore. Compared with the conventional acid-based Mg extracted process for CO2 mineralization, the cheap copperas avoided the recycle of reagent and obtained weak acidic leachate, reducing the amount of alkali used in the subsequent carbonation process.
