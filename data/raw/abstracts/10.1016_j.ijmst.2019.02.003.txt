This paper presents an optimization methodology for the geometric configuration of a room–and–pillar mining project, considering safety and operational restrictions while maximizing ore recovery. An underground manganese mine was chosen as a case study to investigate the capabilities of the presented methodology. A software package (OPTIMINE) was implemented to address the computational demand in an automated manner. Three–dimensional finite difference analyses were performed in FLAC3D and used as implicit functions to consider safety in terms of the factor of safety and room convergence. The obtained results showed that recovery could be increased from 44% to more than 80% in a safe manner.
