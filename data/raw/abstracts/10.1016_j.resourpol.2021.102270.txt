Kingdon's Multiple Streams Model is used in various political contexts, especially to understand agenda-setting processes in Europe and North America. Based on the elements that structure the Multiple Streams Model, this research analyzed the normative, contextual, and political factors that favored the insertion of the mining theme in the Brazilian government's agenda, contributing to the approval of changes in the legislation that regulates mineral policy. As for the problem stream, the results indicate that the discussion about changes in Brazil's mineral policy rekindled when the country was experiencing an economic crisis. The amendment found by the formulators was to update the legislation briefly (solutions stream). In the politics stream, the change in the presidency of the federal government is the factor that exerted the greatest influence for mining to return to the government agenda, finding fertile ground for the approval of changes in mineral policy.
