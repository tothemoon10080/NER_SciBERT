The Earthâ€™s crust includes the outermost layers of the solid surface structure and is composed of various types of rock, which are aggregates containing one or more minerals that were formed under different geological conditions. The minerals contain naturally occurring elements and inorganic compounds. The chemical compositions and physical properties are relatively homogenous and fixed, and the minerals are generally crystalline. V-bearing titanoferrous magnetite is a valuable ore, even though it has a low vanadium concentration, and is the main raw material for vanadium extraction. V-containing magnetite can occur as either the titanomagnetite or Ti-free magnetite. V-containing titanoferrous magnetite generally has low Ti and Fe contents, and enrichment to produce V-containing iron concentrate is performed to meet the requirements of ironmaking in blast furnaces. In addition, direct reduction or direct processing of mineral-grade vanadium can be performed.
