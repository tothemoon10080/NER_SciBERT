The concept of the 4th industrial revolution is becoming a strategic determinant of sustainability, success and competitiveness in the modern mining sector. The importance of digital transformation in the mining industry has long been debated, hampered in part by the conservative nature of the mining sector. Much of the debate has focused on choosing suitable mining techniques that provide acceptable levels of ore/waste selectivity, the scale of implementation, cost reduction and suitable metallurgical extraction techniques. The purpose of this review is to give an overview of the digital transformation of the minerals and extractive industry with a focus towards energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. We address: (a) geological elements that influence the level of selectivity during mining, and technologies that deal with waste rejection; (b) eco-friendly techniques, such as tunnel-boring machines, or the use of non-explosive techniques that can assist fragmentation of ores, thereby decreasing energy requirements during mineral processing and improving mineral recovery; (c) use of low-water-consumption automated ore-waste sorting systems; (d) selective metal leaching using coarse particle percolation as an alternate method for treating complicated low-grade ores; and (e) assessing new technological boundaries for the mineral sector. A combination of these aforementioned processes will significantly reduce mining waste. Orebody features, mining methods and equipment, desired scales of implementation, alignment with circular strategies, ore extraction efficiency, and socio-economic factors all play a role in the development and implementation of new technologies and techniques.
