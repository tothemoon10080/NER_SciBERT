The goal of the current research was to define the impact of individual characteristics on the response of osteoporosis patients to bisphosphonate medication, as well as the influence of gender on changes in the bone mineral density (BMD).The DXA scan was used to assess a group of 647 osteoporosis patients (533 females and 114 males) who visited the St Bartholomew's Hospitals and Royal London osteoporosis clinics. All male subjects received statistically substantial increases in BMD relative to baseline values after two years of therapy. When compared to prior therapy, men's BMD of the lumbar spine (LS) and hip joint (HJ) rose by 0.057 g/cm2 (6.9%, p0.001) and 0.021 g/cm2 (2.48 percent, p0.001), respectively.. Female patients had BMD changes of 0.028 g/cm2 (3.58 percent, p0.001 vs. prior therapy) and −0.006 g/cm2 (−0.78 percent, p0.001 vs. before treatment) in the lumbar spine and hip, respectively. Male patients exhibited a greater increase in BMD than female patients due to ovarian failure and significant oestrogen loss, which speeds up bone resorption by 90% following menopause, according the research findings.
