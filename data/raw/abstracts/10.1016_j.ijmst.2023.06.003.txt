This study investigated the correlations between mechanical properties and mineralogy of granite using the digital image processing (DIP) and discrete element method (DEM). The results showed that the X-ray diffraction (XRD)-based DIP method effectively analyzed the mineral composition contents and spatial distributions of granite. During the particle flow code (PFC2D) model calibration phase, the numerical simulation exhibited that the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) value, elastic modulus (E), and failure pattern of the granite specimen in the UCS test were comparable to the experiment. By establishing 351 sets of numerical models and exploring the impacts of mineral composition on the mechanical properties of granite, it indicated that there was no negative correlation between quartz and feldspar for UCS, tensile strength (σ
                     t), and E. In contrast, mica had a significant negative correlation for UCS, σ
                     t, and E. The presence of quartz increased the brittleness of granite, whereas the presence of mica and feldspar increased its ductility in UCS and direct tensile strength (DTS) tests. Varying contents of major mineral compositions in granite showed minor influence on the number of cracks in both UCS and DTS tests.
