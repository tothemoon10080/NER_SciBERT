Titanium and Fe isotopic compositions of lavas from a calc-alkaline differentiation suite and corresponding mineral separates from the Rindjani Volcano, Indonesia show that Fe and Ti isotopic fractionations between minerals and melts are lower than those recorded in other suites at all stages of differentiation. The limited isotopic fractionation for Ti is likely due to low-Ti magnetite and clinopyroxene being the dominant carriers of Ti in Rindjani lavas, as these minerals are thought to have limited equilibrium Ti isotopic fractionation relative to silicate magmas. Other magmatic differentiation suites controlled by removal of Ti-rich magnetite and characterized by a lesser role of clinopyroxene have larger Ti isotopic fractionations. This effect is an indirect consequence of the elevated Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio of calc-alkaline magmas such as Rindjani, which promotes Fe3+ incorporation into magnetite at the expense of Fe2+-Ti4+ pairs, such that increased oxygen fugacity will subdue Ti isotopic fractionation in global magmatic series. Similarly, we find negligible Fe isotopic fractionation in Rindjani bulk rocks and mineral separates, unlike previous studies. This is also likely due to the oxidized nature of the Rindjani differentiation suite, which leads to similar Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios in melt and minerals and decreases overall mineral-melt Fe fractionation factors. Paired Ti and Fe isotopic analyses may therefore represent a powerful tool to assess oxygen fugacity during differentiation, independent from Fe 3+ determinations of erupted samples.
