Clays and clay minerals are inexpensive, non-toxic, and naturally occurring minerals that have been utilized in water remediation as adsorbents. However, clays and clay minerals and those modified with heat, surfactants, acids, or organic-inorganic modifiers exhibit low adsorption capacity and re-generation ability towards organic water pollutants. The development of clays and clay minerals composites has gained considerable attention in recent years due to their enhanced adsorption capacity, ease of recovery from aqueous solution and improved physiochemical properties relative to raw and modified clays and clay minerals. This review aims to assess recent literature on clays and clay minerals composites including bentonite, montmorillonite and kaolinite intercalated with carbonaceous, metals, metal oxides, chitosan and polymeric materials and appraise their adsorption performance towards organic water pollutants. The review examines the effect of the composites' physicochemical properties on the adsorption performance and evaluates the adsorption mechanism as well as regeneration methods. The review also attempts to highlight the current progress in this area by assessing the outcomes of recently published articles and outline the research gaps for future research.
