In order to further separate the concentrate containing galena and jamesonite before undergoing hydrometallurgical process, flotation experiment was performed on the basis of mineralogical analysis. And the adsorption mechanisms of collector H on galena and jamesonite were also studied by FT-IR spectra analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The flotation result shows that the efficient separation can be achieved with H as selective collector. Galena concentrated with Pb grade of 72.09% and Pb recovery of 50.96% was obtained, and jamesonite concentrated with Sb grade and recovery of 10.89% and 76.67% respectively was obtained as well. Infrared spectrum analysis indicates that collector H can adsorb on the surface of galena and react with Pb2+ to generate hydrophobic salt, while no evident adsorption phenomenon was observed on the surface of jamesonite. The MD simulation and calculation results demonstrate that adsorption energy of collector H on galena and jamesonite surface is −872.74kJ/mol and −500.538kJ/mol, respectively, which means collector H is easier to adsorb on the surface of galena than that of jamesonite.
