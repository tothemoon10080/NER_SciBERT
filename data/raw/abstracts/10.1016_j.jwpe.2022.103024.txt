This paper examines the removal of mineral oil from oily wastewater by a hybrid ultrasonic and electrochemical circulating flow process. The Box-Behnken design was used to study the effects of number of cycles, current density, flow rate and the presence of ultrasound on the efficiency of mineral oil removal and process optimization. A reduced cubic regression model with estimated coefficients was developed to describe the mineral oil removal rate. The experimental results show that this novel hybrid system can effectively reduce mineral oil by 94.3 % under the optimal conditions of 14.130 cycles, current density of 53.07 A/m2 and a flow rate of 0.234 L/s. The experimental observations agreed well with the modelled values, and the model was verified experimentally. Under the optimal conditions, the electrical energy consumption was 10.04 kWh/m3 and the average operational costs were 2.04 EUR/m3.
