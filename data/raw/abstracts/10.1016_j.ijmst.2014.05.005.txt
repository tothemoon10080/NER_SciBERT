Coal washing plants are usually fed from various sources. Coals include different combinations which should be considered for increasing the plant proficiency. Thus different methods have been used to enrich various coal types. In this study, Alborz-Sharghi coal washing plant was investigated which is fed from five coalmines. The optimum recovery was achieved for all coal types individually through experimental design. The controllable operation parameters in the experiments were collector dosage, frother dosage, solid percent content and particle size. The other parameters such as impeller speed, pH, conditioning time and flotation time were kept constant for all experiments. The optimum combination of coals was also specified. The results show that the optimum recovery for coal blends is 91.2% which shows much improvement relative to the plant conditions.
