Post-mineralization thermal evolution is an integral part of the process of formation of ore deposits. However, as two important gold mineralization regions in eastern China, the thermal histories after ore formation of the Jiaodong area is debated while that of the Liaodong area are scarce. Given that the two areas are not only in similar tectonic settings but also have gold deposits that formed in association with the thinning and destruction of the North China Craton, a comparative study can be made. Here new zircon and apatite (U–Th)/He and apatite fission track ages are presented to reconstruct the post-mineralization geological evolution. Four periods of rapid uplift and denudation happening during the 110–100 Ma, 80–70 Ma, 42–38 Ma and 35–32 Ma are defined in Liaodong, and two such periods happening during the 100–95 Ma and 80–72 Ma in Jiaodong. The small timing difference of the rapid uplift (110–100 Ma versus 100–95 Ma) can be explained by the elevation difference of the respective samples. Hence, the evolution processes between the Jiaodong and Liaodong areas are very similar during the Cretaceous, but show marked differences during the Cenozoic. After ore-formation, the erosion amount in Liaodong and Jiaodong is estimated at ∼4.8 and ∼4.7 km, respectively. Moreover, the denudation intensity in Liaodong shows an increase from southeast to northwest. The westward convergence of the Pacific Plate and associated multi-stage activity of the Tanlu and Yalujiang faults are inferred to have induced the regional-scale rapid uplift of the Jiao-Liao areas.
