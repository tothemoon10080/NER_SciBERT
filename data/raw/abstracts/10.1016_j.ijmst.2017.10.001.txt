When mining the fully-mechanized longwall caving face along strike, the unstable equipment, the low top-coal recovery ratio and the difficulty in controlling surrounding rock may occur due to large dip angle. Considering the effects of strike angle on support stability, the “support-surrounding rock” mechanical models of support topple and support slip were established in this paper. On the basis, the influencing factors of support stability were analyzed and the technical measures of controlling support and surrounding rock stability were put forward. Then the loose particles simulation experiment was conducted to analyze the impacts of caving directions and methods on the top-coal recovery in large dip angle fully-mechanized caving face. Finally, the “upward sequence and double-openings double-rounds” caving technology was determined. The research results are of great scientific significance and practical values to improve large dip thick seam mining technology.
