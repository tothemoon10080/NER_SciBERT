Determination of mineral texture and diagenetic features in mudstones is crucial to reveal the history of their pore systems and provides key information to predict their future sealing ability, reactivity and storage capacity for sequestered CO2, hydrogen storage or nuclear waste disposal. To understand the spatial transport and storage of fluids, it is necessary to map the distribution of minerals and fractures in three dimensions (3D). This study proposes a novel, multi-scale three-dimensional (3D) imaging method, i.e., a combination of synchrotron- sourced micro- x-ray tomography and lab- sourced nano-tomography, to investigate the sedimentology and diagenetic features of the Bowland Shale, one of the most volumetrically important mudstone-dominated systems in the UK. Diagenetic minerals have been identified and characterised, including pyrite, calcite, kaolinite, illite, chlorite, dolomite, ankerite and authigenic quartz (micro-sized quartz and quartz overgrowths). Multi-scale 3D images provide detailed information about dolomite-ankerite zonation and carbonate dissolution pores. These features cannot be observed or quantified by conventional 2D methods, and they have not been reported in this subject area before. Using these results, potential reactions during carbon storage and other subsurface storage applications are predicted.
