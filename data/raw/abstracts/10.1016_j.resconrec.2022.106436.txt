Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is a carbon dioxide removal (CDR) solution necessary to achieve net-zero-carbon-emissions goals. While the BECCS potential from large industrial emitters has been quantified, the BECCS potential of small emitters, such as biogas facilities, has not been investigated. Moreover, most BECCS solutions rely on the expected availability of large geological storage capacity for future CDR implementation, although the deployment of CO2 transport and storage supply chains is still a barrier for geological carbon storage ambitions. An alternative opportunity for permanent sequestration of CO2 is concrete, in which captured CO2 can be permanently fixed through carbon dioxide mineralization technologies. We describe and discuss this solution by quantifying the potential of a European bioenergy with carbon capture, utilization, and storage (BECCUS) supply chain, which relies on biogenic CO2 from biogas facilities as a CO2 source, and on carbon dioxide mineralization in concrete as a permanent CO2 sink. This solution is available today, can be adopted seamlessly, and does not need economies of scale for its deployment. We find that European biogas facilities produce 24 Mtons of biogenic CO2 per year, of which 4 Mtons of CO2 per year are emitted from facilities already upgrading biogas into bio-methane. We estimate that carbon dioxide mineralization in recycled concrete aggregates in Europe could permanently store up to 8 Mtons of CO2 per year. Despite the limited storage potential, BECCUS supply chains would reduce CO2 transportation distance and system complexity compared to BECCS supply chains, and would result in a marketable product, namely concrete. Overall, carbon dioxide mineralization in recycled concrete aggregates combines carbon utilization with permanent sequestration, hence contributing to carbon-neutrality goals.
