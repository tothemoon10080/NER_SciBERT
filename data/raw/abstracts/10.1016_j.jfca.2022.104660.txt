Since 1979 world production of mushrooms has increased almost 10-fold, but it is not known whether the mineral composition profile of fruit bodies has changed over time and if so, what the patterns of changes are. This work attempts to determine alterations in the mineral composition of Agaricus bisporus produced in Poland in the years 1977â€“2020. The obtained results indicated a general decrease in the content of most of the analysed elements, which was most likely associated with changes in the growing substrate (horse manure in the first years, followed by the production of compost containing straw and poultry manure). The observed alterations in the content of elements in around 2010 probably resulted from the introduction of supplements during the optimisation of mushroom cultivation. Consuming A. bisporus fruiting bodies produced in Poland has never caused a risk to human health or life. Despite fluctuations in the content of elements in selected years, the results indicate a gradual reduction in the content, especially of nonessential and toxic trace elements. The results obtained from the archival and unique research material reflect current cultivation trends described by changes in the mineral profile of white button mushroom production.
