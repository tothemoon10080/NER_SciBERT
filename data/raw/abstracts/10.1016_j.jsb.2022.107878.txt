Atomic force microscopy-infrared spectroscopy (AFM-IR) and optical photothermal infrared spectroscopy (O-PTIR), which feature spectroscopic imaging spatial resolution down to ∼ 50 nm and ∼ 500 nm, respectively, were employed to characterize the nano- to microscale chemical compositional changes in bone. Since these changes are known to be age dependent, fluorescently labelled bone samples were employed. The average matrix/mineral ratio values decrease as the bone tissue matures as measured by both AFM-IR and O-PTIR, which agrees with previously published FTIR and Raman spectroscopy results. IR ratio maps obtained by AFM-IR reveal variation in matrix/mineral ratio-generating micron-scale bands running parallel to the bone surface as well as smaller domains within these bands ranging from ∼ 50 to 700 nm in size, which is consistent with the previously published length scale of nanomechanical heterogeneity. The matrix/mineral changes do not exhibit a smooth gradient with tissue age. Rather, the matrix/mineral transition occurs sharply within the length scale of 100–200 nm. O-PTIR also reveals matrix/mineral band domains running parallel to the bone surface, resulting in waves of matrix/mineral ratios progressing from the youngest to most mature tissue. Both AFM-IR and O-PTIR show a greater variation in matrix/mineral ratio value for younger tissue as compared to older tissue. Together, this data confirms O-PTIR and AFM-IR as techniques that visualize bulk spectroscopic data consistent with higher-order imaging techniques such as Raman and FTIR, while revealing novel insight into how mineralization patterns vary as bone tissue ages.
