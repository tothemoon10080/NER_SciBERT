Coal combustion mainly releases chromium (Cr) as particulates and may oxidize Cr into toxic hexavalent forms. A series of combustion experiments combined with thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were used to study the speciation transformation behavior of Cr during the burning of a typical bituminous coal. Iron-bearing minerals and the combustion temperature were found to be vital for enriching Cr in ash and preventing Cr oxidation at high-temperature combustion process. During coal combustion, an increasing release trend of Cr versus the combustion temperature was observed. However, the degree of Cr oxidation didn't increase with the increased temperature. The fraction of Cr(VI) reached a maximum at 800°C, but gradually decreased as the combustion temperature rose to 1000°C. Further speciation study revealed that Cr was mostly presented in illite and pyrite in coal, which can be transformed into aluminosilicate glass and hematite. The ion-exchangeable, carbonate, and organic-bound Cr were easily released and also partly converted into less soluble residual form. At high combustion temperature (> 800°C), Fe2O3 exhibited a significant effect on Cr transformation and diminished the Cr(VI) ratios in coal ash. This was beneficial to the ash disposal or reutilization since Cr was retained as stable Cr (III) compounds in ash.
