Protein-mineral interaction is known to regulate biomineral stability and morphology. We hypothesise that fluid phases produce highly dynamic protein-mineral complexes involved in physiology and pathology of biomineralisation. Here, we specifically focus on calciprotein particles, complexes of vertebrate mineral-binding proteins and calcium phosphate present in the systemic circulation and abundant in extracellular fluids - hence the designation of the ensuing protein-mineral complexes as “mud in the blood”. These complexes exist amongst other extracellular particles that we collectively refer to as “the particle zoo”.
