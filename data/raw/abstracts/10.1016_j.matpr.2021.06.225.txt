Acid pretreatment is one of the most widely used fractionation processes for lignocellulosic biomass. In this study, effect of mineral acids (SA, HA, and NA) on recovery of reducing sugar from coconut coir was studied. The independent variables such as reaction time (X1, min) and concentration of acid (X2, % w/w) were optimized using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) for maximum yield of reducing sugar. In this study, 10% w/v of coir was pretreated under various conditions of X1 and X2 by maintaining a constant temperature (121oC). A maximum reducing sugar yield greater than 55% was observed for acid pretreatment.
