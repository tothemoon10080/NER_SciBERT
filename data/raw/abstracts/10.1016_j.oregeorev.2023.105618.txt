Longmendian and the Zhaiwa are the two oldest Mo deposits in the Qinling orogenic belt, China, which is one of the most important Mo provinces in the world with numerous and diverse types of Mo deposits that experienced multistaged mineralization. Here we investigated Mo isotope compositions in molybdenite and rocks from the Longmendian and the Zhaiwa Paleoproterozoic Mo deposits to link Mo isotopes to the sources of Mo metal. The significant Mo isotope variation in the Longmendian and the Zhaiwa Mo deposits (δ98Mo =  −0.51‰ to + 1.01‰ and −0.37‰ to +0.53‰, respectively, relative to NIST-3134) may be controlled by Rayleigh and equilibrium fractionation. The different distributions of Mo isotope compositions of molybdenite in the two deposits may be caused by the physiochemical differences in ore-forming systems. The high Mo content of the Taihua Supergroup and the Xiong’er Group, combined mean values of Mo isotopes between molybdenite and whole rocks suggested that the two stratigraphic units would be the main contributor of Mo for the Paleoproterozoic Mo mineralization that mixed with small proportions of isotopically lower values of the mantle.
