The present study illustrates the use of 2-dodecylmalonic acid (MA) as a template in biomineralization-inspired synthesis of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HANPs). HANPs synthesized in presence of various concentrations of MA displayed varying particle size and shape. The smallest particle size (22–27 nm) was obtained for MA2-HANP synthesized in presence of 37 µM MA. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) for MA at pH 9.0 relevant for mineralization was ∼35 µM. AFM analysis revealed that at a low concentration of 10 µM and pH 9.0, MA could generate oblong-shaped aggregates. At 40 µM, comparable to the concentration used to generate MA2-HANP, the amphiphile self-assembled to form a spherical soft scaffold, which likely regulated spatial confinement of ions during mineralization and generated small size HANPs. Osteoblast-like MG-63 cells seeded on titanium wire (TW) coated with MA2-HANP-incorporated collagen type I (H-TW) displayed enhanced cell proliferation, high expression of osteogenic differentiation marker genes (Col I, ALP, OCN and Runx2) and copious calcium mineral deposition after 14 days of growth. The nuanced role of the self-assembly process of an amphiphilic template in HANP mineralization unravelled in the present study can guide future scaffold design for biomineralization-inspired synthesis of HANPs tailored for bone tissue engineering applications.
