Iron oxide-apatite (IOA) deposits are high grade iron magmatic-hydrothermal mineral deposits having significant economic values and extremely complex and coupled forming processes. The combination model of ore deposits is a model integrating characteristics of several deposits with the same genetic type or sharing close temporal-spatial correlations. This research highlights the usage of numerical simulation method and combination model of deposits in quantitatively analyzing ore-forming processes during the formation of IOA systems and views the future developments of numerical modeling in ore geology research. Our numerical model couples heat transfer, pressure, fluid-flow, chemical reactions and migration of ore-forming materials. Results match the fact that temperature reduction and pressure variation are two key factors controlling the temporal-spatial distribution of iron mineralization, and results of cooling process indicates that a single period of ore formation of IOA deposits may last no more than 12,200Â years, a timespan much shorter than previously estimated. These results are obtained based on the concept of combination model of IOA systems, providing quantitative information reflecting the generation of IOA deposits. However, the methods in our research are stills limitations remained, such as uncertainty of pre-metallogenic conditions and restriction from elementary reactions. Future advances in analytical methods and mathematical models will definitely improve the practicality of combination model of deposits and numerical modeling of ore formation, and provide quantitative answers for existing problems related to mineral deposits.
