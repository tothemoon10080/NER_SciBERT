In this study, the nano-scale spatial distribution of natural organic matter (NOM) on the surface of iron (hydr)oxides and its relevance to oxyanion (PO4
                     3−) and metal cation (Cd2+ and Cu2+) adsorption to the assemblage of oxide (goethite) and NOM (humic acids (HA) or fulvic acids (FA)) was investigated with experiments and advanced surface complexation modeling. Both the linear additive Multi-Surface model (MSM) and the more sophisticated Natural Organic Matter-Charge Distribution (NOM-CD) model were used. The MSM model ignores the effects of NOM-mineral interaction on ion adsorption, whereas the NOM-CD model considers this effect. The results showed that with the increase of NOM loading on oxides, deviation between the MSM and NOM-CD model became bigger for PO4
                     3−, but smaller for Cd2+ and Cu2+. Oxyanions bind mainly to oxides and therefore the competitive effect of NOM cannot be neglected, which explains the large difference between these two models for PO4
                     3−. On the contrary, at a relatively high NOM loading, a large fraction of NOM extends further away from the surface of oxides. Thus for metal cations that bind mainly to NOM, the influence of NOM-mineral interaction on their adsorption is small and the results of the MSM and NOM-CD model are similar. In top soils, the NOM loading on oxides is often high, therefore the linear additive MSM is applicable for metal cation speciation calculations as reported in many literatures. An approach based on the NOM-CD model was proposed, which can not only calculate the macroscopic solid-solution distribution of both cations and anions, but can also provide information regarding their microscopic surface speciation.
