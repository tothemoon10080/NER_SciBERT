Longwall mining is one of the most acclaimed and widely used in underground method for coal extraction. The interaction of powered supports with the roof is the key issue in strata mechanics of longwall mining. Controlled caving of rock mass is a prerequisite pro thriving exploitation of coal deposits by longwall retreat with caving technique and support resistance has evolved as the most promising and effective scientific tool to predict various aspects related to strata mechanics of such workings. Load density, height of caving block, distance of fractured zone ahead of the face, overhang of goaf and mechanical strength of the debris above and below the support base have been found to influence the magnitude of load on supports. Designing powered support has been attempted at the different countries in different methods. This paper reviews the mechanism of roof caving and the conventional approaches of caving behaviour and support resistance requirement in the context of major strata control experiences gained worldwide. The theoretical explanation of the mechanism of roof caving is still continuing with consistently improved understanding through growing field experiences in the larger domain of geo-mining conditions and state-of-art strata mechanics analysis and monitoring techniques.
