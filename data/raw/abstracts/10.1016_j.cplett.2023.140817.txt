Complex and refractory gold ores contain high amount of iron oxide and hydroxide minerals, potential adsorbents of gold through preg-robbing phenomenon. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) approach was used to investigate the adsorption of

                      complex was adsorbed from the Au atom along the y axis on the Fe site and the interaction energy was the highest. The following trend was obtained for the preg-robbing potential, which is in good agreement with experiments carried out on synthetic minerals: Goethite > Hematite > Magnetite.
