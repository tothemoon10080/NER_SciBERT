Water management is the crucial aspect of every mineral processing plant, especially presently with increasing environmental awareness and water scarcity in many mining regions. To meet these demands, mining companies worldwide begin to implement technological solutions which are concentrated on water reuse in internal water circuits. Wastewater circuits could be divided into two types: short and long, which will differ in case of technology used, complexity, as well as water quality, volume, and retention time in a system. In this paper the description of positive and negative aspects of both circuit types was presented, but the main focus was on the water quality characteristics in the system, and its impact on mineral processing.
