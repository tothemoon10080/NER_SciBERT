Fungus Cladosporium sp. strain F1 showed highly effective biosorption capacity to lead phosphate mineral and perovskite solar cells lead iodide compared to other fungi Aspergillus niger VKMF-1119 and Mucor ramannianus R-56. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analyses shows that Cladosporium sp. strain F1, which previously showed high biosorption capacity to uranium phosphate nanorods and nanoplates, can accumulate lead phosphate mineral and lead iodide on the fungal hyphae surface in large amounts under a wide range of pH conditions, while A. niger VKMF-1119 and M. ramannianus R-56 adsorbed small amounts of minerals. After biosorption of lead iodide minerals on Cladosporium sp. strain F1, aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide (50%) at pH 2 (70 °C) released the mineral more than 99%. Based on the fungal surface analyses, hydrophobic properties on the surfaces of Cladosporium sp. strain F1 could affect the higher biosorption capacity of strain F1 to lead phosphate mineral and lead iodide as compared to other tested fungi. Cladosporium sp. strain F1 may be the novel biosorbents to remediate the phosphate rich environment and to recover lead from perovskite solar cells lead iodide.
