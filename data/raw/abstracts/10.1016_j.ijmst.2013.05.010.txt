The cyclonic-static microbubble flotation column has dual effects including the cyclonic separation and floatation separation with the characteristics of the small lower limit of the effective separation size, short separation time, large handling capacity, and low operation cost. It shows significant advantages in the oily wastewater treatment field, especially the polymer flooding oily wastewater treatment aspect. In this paper, the cyclonic separation function mechanism of the cyclonic-static microbubble flotation column was studied, the impact of the parameters including the feeding rate, aeration rate, circulating pressure, and underflow split ratio on the cyclonic separation efficiency was investigated, and the cyclonic separation efficiency model was established as well. In addition, by applying the Doppler Laser Velocimeter (LDV) and Fluent simulation software, the test and simulation to the single-phase flow velocity field of the cyclonic separation section of the cyclonic-static microbubble flotation column were carried out, and the velocity distribution rule of the cyclonic separation section was analyzed under the single-phase flow conditions.
