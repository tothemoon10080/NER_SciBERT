A kinetics model with lumped components and TOC fractionation is proposed to track paracetamol degradation, as a model pollutant, using the photo-Fenton process. The proposed structure shows acceptable predictive capabilities regarding hydrogen peroxide consumption, TOC mineralization and dissolved oxygen evolution. The number of model parameters is considered assumable in calibrating other pollutants and degradation mixtures when applying this technology. This study covers a pollutant load range between 4 and 25mM of TOC. The Fe2+ initial load varied between 0.089 and 0.44mM whilst the initial H2O2 concentration tested ranged from 9mM to 45mM. The influence of light intensity was considered explicitly within the model whilst temperature and pH conditions were held constant. The fixed structure model, containing 9 kinetic parameters and 3 stoichiometric coefficients, was later applied to a pollutant mixture with a successful prediction of hydrogen peroxide and TOC profiles.
