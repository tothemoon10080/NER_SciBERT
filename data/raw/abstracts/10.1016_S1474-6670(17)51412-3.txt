The raw ores which are processed in mineral processing plants exhibit very strong variations of their physical and chemical properties. As a consequence the performances of the comminution and separation processes greatly vary from time to time. Model-based control strategies improve the performance of the plant, however they need some form of adaptation to cope with the variations of the ore properties. Some methods which have been already proposed in the litterature or evaluated by the authors are discussed. For instance various techniques for on-line ore grindability and floatability estimation are presented as well as their use in filtering and control algorithms. The interests and limits of adaptive techniques in the context of mineral processing are evaluated.
