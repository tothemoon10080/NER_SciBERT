Mineral exploration is a multifaceted process aiming at narrowing down the search space for discovering new mineral deposits. Conducting several surveys, be they geochemical, geological, or geophysical, is a prerequisite to selecting seemingly favorable exploration targets. The more data one can achieve, the more certain the exploration targets will become. However, given the complexity of ore-forming processes and considering the premise that buried, covered, and deep-seated mineral deposits usually do not show strong geochemical and geophysical signatures, the output of different surveys should be compiled and integrated into a series of maps showing the potential of discovering mineral deposits. Geographical information system (GIS) systems can provide support to fulfilling the previous goal. Geological and mathematical frameworks constitute two key aspects of GIS-based mineral exploration, covered in this chapter. Also, in this chapter, we will acknowledge that GIS-based mineral exploration is not without untold risk; that is, different uncertainties linked to GIS-based processes that eventually propagate into the exploration targets will be discussed in this chapter.
