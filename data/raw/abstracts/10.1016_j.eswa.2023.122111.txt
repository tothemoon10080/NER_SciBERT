Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has significant potential in Earth sciences, particularly in mineral identification for industrial exploration, geological mapping, and archaeological research. However, traditional methods are time-consuming, expensive, and complex. And existing mineral identification methods based on mineral photos face several critical challenges, including lack of consideration for natural image features captured in real environments, limitations of single-label classification which does not align with multi-mineral occurrences in nature, and growing computational complexity as the number of identifiable mineral labels increases. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient mineral identification model based on multi-label image classification, focusing on natural environmental features. First, realistic feature datasets are created by simulating mineral photos in real environments. Then, the model uses the query-label (Query2Label) framework, with MaxViT-T (Multi-Axis Vision Transformer-Tiny) as the feature extraction network and the asymmetric loss function. Knowledge distillation is employed to improve identification accuracy while reducing computational complexity. The proposed model achieves an impressive average identification accuracy of 84.74% on a dataset of 495,756 mineral photos, surpassing existing models like ResNet-101, ML-GCN (Multi-Label Graph Convolutional Network), and SRN (Spatial Regularization Net). It maintains a lower parameter count and computational complexity. In the end, ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each optimization scheme.
