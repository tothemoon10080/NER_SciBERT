In this work, the research status of superhydrophobic composite materials using clay minerals as the framework is systematically summarized, mainly based on the literature analysis in the past twelve years about superhydrophobic materials of domestic and overseas. The clay minerals mainly contain sepiolite and palygorskite with nanofiber structure, kaolin, montmorillonite with nanosheet structure, and halloysite with nano hollow tube structure. The effects of factors containing the microstructure of clay minerals and the types of coupling agents on the superhydrophobic properties and the mechanisms of nano clay minerals superhydrophobic composites are compared, providing reference for the low-cost preparation of high performance superhydrophobic composites and high value-added utilization of nano clay minerals.
