Over half the world population relies on rice for energy, but being a carbohydrate-based crop, it offers limited nutritional benefits. To achieve nutritional security targets in Asia, we must understand the genetic variation in multi-nutritional properties with therapeutic properties and deploy this knowledge to future rice breeding. High throughput, VideometerLAB spectral imaging data has been effective in estimating total anthocyanin content, particularly bound anthocyanin content, using the high prediction power of partial least square (PLS) regression models. Multi-pronged nutritional properties of phenolic compounds and minerals, together with videometerLAB features, were utilized to develop models to classify a collection of black rice varieties into three distinct nutritional quality ideotypes. These derived models for black rice diversity panels were created utilizing videometerLAB data (L, A, B parameters), selected phenolic types (total phenolics, total anthocyanins, and bound flavonoids), and minerals (Molybdenum and Phosphorous). Random forest and artificial neural network models depicted the multi-nutritional features of black rice with 85.35 and 99.9% accuracy, respectively. These prediction algorithms would help rice breeders strategically breed nutritionally valuable genotypes based on simple, high-through-put videometerLAB readings and a small number of nutritional assays.
