Rock fragmentation is one of the most commonly optimized blasting outcomes due to its significant influence on the efficiency of downstream operations. This paper reviews the influence of blast fragmentation on processing of metal ores. Two aspects of rock fragmentation that influence downstream mineral processing operations include the particle size of the run-of-mine ore and the degree of internal microfracturing in the fragments induced by blasting. The main influences identified include productivity of comminution equipment, energy consumption in comminution equipment and mineral recovery. An increase in blasting energy results in higher throughput and energy reduction in comminution circuits. Increase in blasting energy results in energy savings in the overall mining operations. However, when increasing the blasting energy, the environmental and safety impacts must be taken into consideration. Blast-induced microfractures increase the permeability of the fragments, therefore enhancing mineral exposure to leaching reagents and consequently may lead to higher mineral recoveries, particularly in heap and dump leaching operations which employ-one-stage comminution. However, the textural characteristics of the ore also influence the mineral recovery. Further research should focus on establishing the relationship between blast intensity and mineral leaching recovery for metal ores of different textural properties.
