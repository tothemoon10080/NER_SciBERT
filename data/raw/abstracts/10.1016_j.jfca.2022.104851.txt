Physicochemical characteristics, phenolic, and mineral compounds of bracatinga honeydew honeys (BHH) from the south Brazilian plateau were evaluated, as requested for denomination of origin (DO) certification. Thirty-four samples were analyzed, and ANOVA and principal components analysis were carried out to classify them. Moisture content (<20 %), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (< 10.0 mg kg-1), diastase activity (>8 Shade units), and electrical conductivity (> 0.8 mS cm−1) met the international standards. Free acidity was higher than 50.0 mEq kg-1, and reducing sugars (fructose and glucose) ranged from 58 % to 75 %. Syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, and rutin were the major phenolic compounds. In the PCA scatterplot (PC1 46.6%, PC2 25.8 %), BHH formed one single group, due to the common physicochemical parameters, with only two samples separated with higher levels of minerals Ba, Co, Pd, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, and V. The result proved that there was no distinction among the BHH samples, meeting the requirements for DO certification.
