The recycling of thermoplastics containing mineral fillers represents great technological challenges in the waste management in the plastics industry. Several mineral-filled polystyrene samples were prepared and their morphological and melt processing properties were studied with respect to the processing conditions and mineral loadings. The results should provide insights that are needed to solve complex issues encountered in the industry dealing with the recycling of this important class of materials.
