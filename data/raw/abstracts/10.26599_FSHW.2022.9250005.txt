In response to the rapid increase in world population and subsequent demands for food, edible insects represent an alternative food source for humans that is rich in proteins, amino acids and minerals. Entomophagy is a tradition in many countries including China and Thailand, and edible insects have attracted a lot of attention in Western World due to their suitable nutrient composition, high mineral content (e.g., Fe, Zn, Ca, Mg) and potential use as a supplement in human diet. In this study, we surveyed mineral content in seven insect orders and 67 species of mass produced and wild-harvested edible insects. The total content of essential elements in edible insects was very high in Tenebrio molitor, Bombyx mori, and Zonocerus variegatus. The heavy metal content (summarized for eight species) was below the maximum limit allowed for safe consumption. Sustainable supply of minerals derived from insect biomass is complicated due to the high variations of mineral content in insects and the potential of its change due to processing.
