Liquid glass is a widely used reagent in mineral raw processing and it is the subject of quite a number of studies. The paper presents the results reflecting its novelty and proves that the mechanism of liquid glass effect and actively depressing or activating forms are defined by the nature of the mineral and the process conditions. Thus, the authors proved that during floatation of the pulp with pH of more than 11, the depressive impact of liquid glass on fluorite is decreased due to reducing the adsorption of SiO3
                     2- ions on the negatively charged surface of the mineral. It is proved that the liquid glass consumption in ten sifies the effect of disjoining pressure of fluid films resulting in the increase of the content of generated class -0.071 mm in the finely ground iron-vanadium middlings and magnetite ore. Liquid glass reduces the coercive force in tensity and substantially weakens the magnetic properties of minerals thus im proving iron-vanadium concentrate quality during further recleaning.
