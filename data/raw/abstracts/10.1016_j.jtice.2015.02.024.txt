A waste iron oxide (labelled as BT4), which was a by-product of the fluidized-bed Fenton treatment of the bio-treated tannery wastewater, was utilized as the catalyst for the mineralization of bisphenol A (BPA) by a heterogeneous photo-Fenton process in a three-phase fluidized bed reactor. The main constituent of BT4 was identified as α-FeOOH, while BT4 exhibited higher catalytic activity than pure α-FeOOH. The effects of catalyst loading, H2O2 concentration and initial pH on the mineralization of BPA were elucidated. With 2 g/L catalyst loading, 0.74 mmol/L H2O2 and initial pH 3, 90% TOC of 0.05 mmol/L BPA was removed after 180 min reaction. The result of the catalyst reuse experiment indicated that BT4 showed a good stability.
