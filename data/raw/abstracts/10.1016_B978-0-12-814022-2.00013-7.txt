Metal content and surface properties vary widely between minerals. End-users look for the highest purity of minerals. Run-of-mine ore is beneficiated through particle size reduction, liberation, separation, and concentration using physical and surface chemical properties. Ore is crushed, grinded, and classified. Valuable minerals are concentrated by leaching and sorting with light reflectance, gamma radiation, and X-ray luminescence. Gravity concentration is possible by panning, jigging, spiraling, shaking table, and multigravity and dense medium separation. Magnetic and electrostatic properties aid in concentration. The majority of ore (Cu, Zn, Pb, platinum-group elements, etc.) is best suited to froth flotation, which includes conditioning of fine liberated particles and reagents like collectors, depressors, regulators, and frothers. Slurry passes through rougher-scavenger cells and concentrates. Concentrates are cleaned by washing, sedimentation, and dewatering. Rejects are disposed to tailing ponds or used for the void-filling stabilization of underground stopes. Column flotation improves quality and recovery. Plant performance is judged by metallurgical accounting, metal balancing, operating cost, quantity, purity, recovery, and valuation. Extractive pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and refining processes recover the purest metals from concentrates.
