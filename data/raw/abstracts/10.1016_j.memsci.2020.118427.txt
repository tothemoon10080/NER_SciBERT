Flux decline of filtration membranes caused by oil pollutants is one of the most serious challenges for oil/water separation. Aiming at improving the anti-fouling property as well as the cyclic stability, a mineralized membrane was fabricated by growing cupric phosphate [Cu3(PO4)2] nanoparticles onto polyacrylic acid-grafted-poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PAA-g-PVDF) microfiltration membrane via soaking mineralization process for oil-in-water emulsion separation. The uniform distribution of Cu3(PO4)2 nanoparticles on both the membrane surface and the inner pores endows the membrane with rigid structure and superhydrophilic property, and thus outstanding anti-oil-fouling performance. The Cu3(PO4)2/PAA-g-PVDF mineralized membranes exhibit low decay rate of permeating flux during 2Â h continuous test and a nearly 100% recovery ratio for the separation of various oil-in-water emulsions. Moreover, the membranes possess good mechanical and chemical stability toward ultrasonic, salts and wide pH range, which is promising for treating practical oily wastewater.
