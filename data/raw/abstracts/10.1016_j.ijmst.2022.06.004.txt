Resistivity will have different response characteristics to the hydraulic fracture propagation process. In this work, a resistivity testing system for hydraulic fracturing specimens was established. Resistivity and acoustic emission (AE) information were jointly analysed to determine the dynamic response characteristics of resistivity during hydraulic fracture propagation. The results show that the water and fracture exert a competitive influence on the connection structure of the circuit, and there are two significant peak resistivity points in the curve, presenting a double peak therein. The peak resistivity data of the specimen with a larger fracture area are much different from the initial value. With the increase of the rate of injection, the range of variation of the highest value that can be reached with the specimen resistivity decreases. High resistivity rates or high resistivity fluctuations exhibit rapid a release of fracture energy. The fracture failure mode dominated by shear fractures makes the formation produce a “series+parallel” electrical connection structure; a calculation model of formation resistivity based on shear and tensile failure was proposed to characterize the proportion of different types of hydraulic fractures and elucidate the control effect of matrix resistivity on the electrical performance of the overall circuit structure.
