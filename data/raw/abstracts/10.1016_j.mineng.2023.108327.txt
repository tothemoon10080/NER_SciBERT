Barite is a critical mineral that finds applications in many industries. The mineral is commonly occurred in deposits formed in a variety of geological environments where other semi-soluble minerals such as calcite and fluorite are also present. Because of decreasing ore grade, the mineral processing of barite nowadays becomes increasingly challenging if the separation to be achieved by mineral processing techniques such as gravity or magnetic separation. Instead, froth flotation has been demonstrated as the most effective method. This work provides a literature review on the current state of barite in terms resource type, production and processing via froth flotation. Also suggested is that new barite resources need to be explored to meet the upcoming demand. For froth flotation, although fatty acids are still extensively used as collectors, other reagents such as petroleum-based sulfonates, lauryl phosphates and those inspired by bio-approaches need to be investigated. Additionally, froth flotation of barite from secondary resources merits more attention.
