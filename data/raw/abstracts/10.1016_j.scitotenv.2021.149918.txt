Co-sorption of metal ions and anions/ligands at the mineral–water interface plays a critical role in regulating the mobility, transport, fate, and bioavailability of these components in natural environments. This review focuses on co-sorption of metal ions and naturally occurring anions/ligands on environmentally relevant minerals. The underlying mechanisms for their interfacial reactions are summarized and the environmental impacts are discussed. Co-sorption mechanisms of these components depend on a variety of factors, such as the identity and properties of minerals, pH, species and concentration of metal ions and anions/ligands, addition sequence of co-sorbed ions, and reaction time. The simultaneous presence of metal ions and anions/ligands alters the initial sorption behaviors with promotive or competitive effects. Promotive effects are mainly attributed to surface electrostatic interactions, ternary surface complexation, and surface precipitation, especially for the co-sorption systems of metal ions and inorganic anions on minerals. Competitive effects involve potential complexation of metal–anions/ligands in solution or their competition for surface adsorption sites. Organic ligands usually increase metal ion sorption on minerals at low pH via forming ternary surface complexes or surface precipitates, but inhibit metal ion sorption via the formation of aqueous complexes at high pH. The different mechanisms may act simultaneously during metal ion and anion/ligand co-sorption on minerals. Finally, the potential application for remediation of metal-contaminated sites is discussed based on the different co-sorption behaviors. Future challenges and topics are raised for metal–anion/ligand co-sorption research.
