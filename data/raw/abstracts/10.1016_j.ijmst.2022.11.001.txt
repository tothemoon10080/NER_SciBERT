The fine scheelite flotation using garnet and glass beads as agitation medium was investigated through slurry rheology and froth property analysis. The apparent viscosity of fine scheelite, calcite and quartz (−20 μm) slurry were measured and the corresponding scheelite flotation behaviours, froth water recovery and froth height were studied. It was found that calcite slurry could aggregate into network structures and exhibit much higher apparent viscosity at the vicinity of pH 8.5–9.0 than scheelite and quartz (scheelite, calcite, and quartz slurry at 20.34, 38.66, and 14.58 mPa·s, respectively). Agitation medium containing garnet and glass beads could reduce the slurry apparent viscosity by effectively dispersing the calcite network structures in flotation slurry, and improve the fine scheelite flotation selectivity. As the apparent viscosity was reduced, the froth water recovery decreased from 24.33% to 6.37% and initial froth height of the flotation froth decreased from 69.6 to 8.7 mm, and finally results in increase in separation efficiency from 23.10% to 31.96%. The results could be potentially used in flotation of fine minerals by applying agitation medium to improve the process selectivity.
