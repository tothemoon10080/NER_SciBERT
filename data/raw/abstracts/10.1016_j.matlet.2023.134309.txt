The reference peptide's side groups (polylysine, PL(â€“NH2)) were changed to create the carboxy-grafted polylysine (PL-COOH), and Methyl-grafted polylysine (PL-CH3) peptides. The influence of polypeptides with different side groups on the surface mineralization behavior of hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate (HA/TCP) biphasic ceramics was investigated using the static immersion mineralization method of simulated bodily fluid and the dynamic mineralization method based on quartz crystal microbalance (QCM-D) technology. Experiments revealed that changing the side groups of the peptides altered their secondary structure as well as the adsorption behavior on the substrate surface. Furthermore, the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the substrate surface were altered by peptide adsorption. These structural and property changes impacted Ca2+ and PO4
                     3- concentrations, and thus governed biomineralization. This study will offer fresh perspectives on bone implant material surface design.
