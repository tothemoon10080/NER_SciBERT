                  Study focus
                  The characteristics and process of water-rock interactions of natural mineral water are revealed using hydrochemical and isotopic data.
               
                  New hydrological insights
                  The results confirm rock weathering plays a leading role in the mechanism of chemical composition of mineral water, which is controlled by lithology and tectonic environment within the region. Mineral water chemistry is mainly controlled by dissolution/precipitation of feldspar, pyroxene and olivine. The hydrolysis of primary silicate minerals may provide solutes for CO2 and metasilicate. Deep underground circulation and shallow soil leaching promotes the formation compound mineral water. Affected by temperature and water vapor sources, slope of Local Meteoric Water Line is less than Global Meteoric Water Line. Compared with mineral water, surface water is more affected by evaporation and stable isotopes of it is more enrich. There is a certain delay in precipitation recharge according to isotope characteristics. The average recharge ratio of mineral water to surface water is 60%, which has a great impact on the amount of surface water resources. These results can provide a reference for the establishment of genetic model and sustainable utilization of natural mineral water with high ecological value.
