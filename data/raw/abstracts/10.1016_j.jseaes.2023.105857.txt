Zuun Mod is a porphyry-type Mo-Cu deposit located in the Edren terrane in Southwest Mongolia. The deposit has estimated resources of 218 Mt with an average Mo grade of 0.057% and Cu grade of 0.069%, and significant amounts of Re. The deposit is characterized by multiple pulses of magmatism and exsolution of magmatic ore fluids and associated alteration and mineralization. The timing of these events and the tectonic environment were unconstrained, and the deposit’s origin remains controversial. Based on drill core and field examinations, four lithological units of the Bayanbulag intrusive complex are identified in the deposit area including quartz syenite, quartz monzonite, granodiorite, and granite. The majority of Mo mineralization at Zuun Mod occurs in sheeted and stockwork quartz veins that crosscut units of the Bayanbulag complex as well as disseminations within altered granitoids wherein the mineralized quartz veins occur with potassic and phyllic alteration selvages. Zircon U-Pb age dating for quartz monzonite and granodiorite defined the timing of magmatic events at 305.3 ± 3.6 Ma and 301.8 ± 2.7 Ma, respectively. Molybdenite Re-Os geochronology on grains from a quartz vein with potassic alteration selvage determined the age of Mo mineralization at 297 ± 4.8 Ma. Lithogeochemical data of intrusive units suggest the granitoid rocks show calc-alkaline to high-K calc-alkaline, I-type, and metaluminous to slightly peraluminous affinities that formed in a post-collisional setting and were likely sourced from subduction-modified lithosphere. Lithogeochemical signatures and the tectonic environment classify Zuun Mod into neither Climax nor Endako-types, but as a Mo-rich porphyry Cu deposit.
