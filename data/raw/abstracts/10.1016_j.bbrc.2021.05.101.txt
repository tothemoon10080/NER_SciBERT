Isoflavones are phytoestrogens abundant in leguminous crops and are used to prevent a variety of hormonal disorders. In the present study, the effects of genistein and daidzein on the chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells were investigated. Genistein (10 μM) treatment markedly reduced production of sulfated proteoglycans and collagen fibers in the ATDC5 cells. Genistein suppressed the expression of genes involved in chondrocyte differentiation such as Sox9, Col2a1, Col10a1, Acan, and Tgfb1. Additionally, genistein significantly decreased calcium deposition in ATDC5 cells during chondrogenic differentiation; however, it increased calcification under non-chondrogenic mineralizing conditions. Daidzein exhibited a similar effect of suppressing chondrogenesis in ATDC5 cells, although its efficacy was 10-times lower than that of genistein. These findings suggest that a high concentration of genistein inhibits chondrogenesis and chondrogenic mineralization, whereas it enhances non-chondrogenic mineralization.
