Functional materials based on the hybrids of layered clay minerals and water-soluble polymers have been reported extensively. Here, the studies on the interactions between water-soluble polymers and layered clay minerals are summarized to clarify the structure-property relationship in these hybrids for the reported application from the viewpoint of the uniqueness over other nanocomposites of water-soluble polymers and various nanoparticles. The reported application of hybrids of layered clay minerals and water-soluble polymers includes solid-electrolyte and gas barrier film for packaging and such characteristics as stabilities and self-healing were also examined as associating characteristics necessary for the practical application. These functions/characters have been designed by the structure, which is controlled by the choices of layered clay minerals, polymers and their composition (polymer/clay ratio) as well as the processing.
