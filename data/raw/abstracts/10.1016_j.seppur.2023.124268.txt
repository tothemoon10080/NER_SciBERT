CO2 mineralization is a significant method for effective CO2 emission control because of formation of stable carbonate products and the availability of abundant mineral resources. The economic concern of the direct aqueous CO2 mineralization prevents the application to global warming mitigation. This work discovers that the CO2 mineralization of olivine can be significantly enhanced by using nitriloacetate (NTA) salt due to the competitive complexation and extraction of nickel and cobalt versus carbonate precipitation. The highly selective critical metal extraction can be also achieved and even considerably enhanced by using NTA compared to using ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) salt. Nearly 90% CO2 mineralization, nickel and cobalt extraction can be achieved and is suitable for both nickel-poor olivine and nickel-rich saprolite and limonite laterites. The recovery of nickel and cobalt makes the CO2 mineralization process favourable in both economics and technical outcome. The enhanced CO2 mineralization process can potentially earn $29, $557, and $221 net benefits for each t olivine, saprolite, and limonite, respectively. The success of the CO2 mineralization in technical and economic feasibility can potentially make the CO2 mineralization widely applicable and can make significant contributions to sustainable minerals engineering and resources management, and enhanced supply of critical metals and CO2 storage.
