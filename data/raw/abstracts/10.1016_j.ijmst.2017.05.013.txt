High pressure, radon bearing water has been identified as one of the most critical challenges in mining the high-grade uranium deposit at the McArthur River Operation, Cameco Corporation. The ore deposits are located between 490 and 640m below the surface and surrounded by water bearing Athabasca sandstone, a graphitic P2 fault zone, and highly altered ground. This paper introduces the inflow risk management program at McArthur River Operation, which includes various hydrogeological challenges and the corresponding strategies applied, such as risk-based probe and grout programs (geological, hydrogeological, and geotechnical), ground freezing programs, and comprehensive ground control programs. These programs have been developed, tested, and proven successful over years of mining practices. Working with this world class deposit of high risk and low tolerance, it is believed that these experiences might be beneficial to other mining operations with similar hydrogeological characteristics.
