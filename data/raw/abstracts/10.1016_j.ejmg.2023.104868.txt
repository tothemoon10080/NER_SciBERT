Background
                  knowledge on the natural history of rare diseases is necessary to improve outcomes. Disease registries may play a key role in covering these unmet needs in the rare bone and mineral community.
               
                  Objective
                  to map existing bone and mineral conditions registries in Europe and their characteristics.
               
                  Methods
                  online survey about the use of registries/databases and their characteristics. This survey was disseminated among members of the European Reference Network on Rare Bone Diseases (ERN BOND) and non-ERN experts in the field of bone and mineral conditions as well as patient organisations.
               
                  Results
                  sixty-three responses from health care providers (HCPs) and 10 responses from patient groups (PGs) were collected. The response rate for ERN BOND members was 55%. Of 63 HCPs, 37 declared using a registry. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) was the most registered condition. We mapped 3 international registries, all were disease-specific.
               
                  Conclusions
                  There is a need for developing a common high-quality platform for registering rare bone and mineral conditions.
