The utility of a soil microbe, namely Bacillus polymyxa, in the removal of organic reagents such as dodecylamine, ether diamine, isopropyl xanthate and sodium oleate from aqueous solutions is demonstrated. Time-bound removal of the above organic reagents from an alkaline solution was investigated under different experimental conditions during bacterial growth and in the presence of metabolites by frequent monitoring of residual concentrations as a function of time, reagent concentration and cell density. The stages and mechanisms in the biodegradation process were monitored through UV-visible and FTIR spectroscopy. Surface chemistry of the bacterial cells as well as the biosorption tendency for various organics were also established through electrokinetic and adsorption density measurements. Both the cationic amines were found to be biosorbed followed by their degradation through bacterial metabolism. The presence of the organic reagents promoted bacterial growth through effective bacterial utilization of nitrogen and carbon from the organics. Under optimal conditions, complete degradation and bioremoval of all the organics could be achieved.
