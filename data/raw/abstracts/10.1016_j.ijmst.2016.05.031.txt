A series of plane-strain physical model experiments are carried out to study the spatiotemporal evolution rule of rocks fracture surrounding gob-side roadway, which is subjected to the pressure induced by the mining process. The digital photogrammetry technology and large deformation analysis method are applied to measure the deformation and fracture of surrounding rocks. The experimental results indicate that the deformation and fracture of coal pillars are the cause to the instability and failure of the surrounding rocks. The spatiotemporal evolution rule of the rock deformation and fracture surrounding gob-side roadway is obtained. The coal pillar and the roof near coal pillar should be strengthened in support design. The engineering application results also can provide a useful guide that the combined support with wire meshes, beam, anchor bolt and cable is an effective method.
