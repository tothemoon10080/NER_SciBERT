In order to study the evolution laws during the development process of the coal face overburden rock mining-induced fissure, we studied the process of evolution of overburden rock mining-induced fissures and dynamically quantitatively described its fractal laws, based on the high-precision microseismic monitoring method and the nonlinear Fractal Geometry Theory. The results show that: the overburden rock mining-induced fissure fractal dimension experiences two periodic change processes with the coal face advance, namely a Small→Big→Small process, which tends to be stable; the functional relationship between the extraction step distance and the overburden rock mining-induced fissure fractal dimension is a cubic curve. The results suggest that the fractal dimension reflects the evolution characteristics of the overburden rock mining-induced fissure, which can be used as an evaluation index of the stability of the overburden rock strata, and it provides theoretical guidance for stability analysis of the overburden rock strata, goaf roof control and the support movements in the mining face.
