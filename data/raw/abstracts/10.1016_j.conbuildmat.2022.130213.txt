As a common pavement deicing salt, sodium chloride has adverse effects on asphalt pavement. In this study, molecular modeling methods were used to analyze the effects of mineral composition and chloride salt erosion on the interfacial adhesion properties of asphalt-aggregate composites. Four representative asphalts (AAA-1, AAK-1, AAM-1, and AAF-1), three representative minerals (Î±-quartz, calcium carbonate, and alumina), and sodium chloride solutions were selected to model the asphalt-aggregate composites exposed to chloride salt erosion. The effects of asphalt type, mineral composition, salt concentration, and erosion temperature on the interface adhesion of the asphalt mixture were considered. The chloride salt erosion resistance of the four components and asphalt molecules were further analyzed. The simulation results indicate that the effect of erosion temperature on the interfacial adhesion performance is minor. The interfacial adhesion decreased with the increase in chloride salt concentration. Alkaline minerals are more susceptible to chloride salt erosion, followed by neutral and acidic minerals. The adhesion energies of resin and aromatic decreased most significantly in alkaline minerals, followed by neutral minerals, and the least decreased in acidic minerals exposed to chloride salt erosion. Asphalt molecules with more aromatic rings, shorter alkyl side chains, and stronger polarity have strong resistance to chloride salt erosion and can form strong adsorption with the active sites on the mineral surface. However, asphalt molecules with long-chain alkanes, fewer aromatic rings, or longer alkyl side chains are difficult to resist chloride salt erosion.
