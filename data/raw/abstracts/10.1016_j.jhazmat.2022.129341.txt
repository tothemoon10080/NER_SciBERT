Mineral fines act a pivotal part in determining the fate and behavior of oil. In this study, the infiltrations of oil emulsion in simulated sediments and natural shoreline sediments were investigated using a fixed bed experiment. Oil infiltration process was simulated based on fixed-bed dispersion model. The role of mineral fines in oil release was explored using simulated and natural sediments. Although mineral fines exhibited a higher affinity for oil, it was found that increasing fines fractions decreased the flow rate of oil emulsion, thereby decreasing the oil retention in the sediment column. In terms of oil release from the sediment, the highest level of oil mass was observed in the oil-mineral flocculation phase compared to the water column and the water surface compartments. Compared to light crude oil, the release of engine oil from sediment was less. The effects of mineral fines on oil infiltration and release were also confirmed by using natural shoreline sediments. Results of our detailed field studies also showed that current shoreline classification datasets do not characterize the presence and fraction of mineral fines at a level of detail required to accurately predict the significance of oil translocation following spill incidents.
