The model predictive static programming (MPSP) technique, which is extended recently to incorporate applicable state and control constraints, operates on the philosophy of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). However, it reduces the problem into a lower-dimensional problem of control variables alone, thereby enhancing computational efficiency significantly. Because of this, problems with larger dimensions and/or increased complexity can be solved using MPSP without changing the computational infrastructure. In this paper, the MPSP technique with applicable constraints is applied to two challenging control problems in the mineral processing industry: (i) a single-stage grinding mill circuit model, and (ii) a four-cell flotation circuit model. The results are compared with a conventional nonlinear MPC approach. Comparison studies show that constrained MPSP executes much faster than constrained MPC with similar/improved performance. Therefore, it can be considered a potential optimal control candidate for mineral processing plants.
