The Buziwannan gold-polymetallic deposit is located in Northwest China's West Kunlun Orogen Belt (WKOB). There are two metallogenic stages that have been identified: skarn and hydrothermal. In this research study, in situ mineral geochemistry and sulfur–lead isotopes are used to precisely constrain the genesis and ore-forming process.
                  Pyrite is the most dominant sulfide, and four types have been identified. Py0 is a sedimentary euhedral crystal; Py1 is a subhedral grain occurring in skarn ores, and coexists with Po1, Apy1, Ccp1 and Gn1; Py2, which coexists with Apy2, Po2 and Ccp2, is a subhedral to irregular crystal; and Py3 is a colloform crystal. Gn2 is the most recent sulfide. Magnetite and Ccp1 LA–ICMPS analyses indicate a skarn origin. Py0 and Py1 have the highest Co/Ni ratios and Ni contents, respectively, and Au has positive correlations with Pb, Ag and As, according to the trace element compositions of pyrite (LA–ICPMS). With the exception of four spots, most pyrites have Au (0.01–30.23 ppm) and As (1.47–15,709 ppm) concentrations below the Au saturation line, indicating that the majority of gold is present as lattice bound Au+. Py3 has clearly higher Sb contents indicating that Sb-rich fluids were added.
                  The δ34S values of sulfides show that the sedimentary Py0 and skarn sulfides have the highest and lowest δ34S values of +13.30 to +14.67 ‰ and +4.48 to +7.77 ‰, respectively, and other sulfides possess δ34S values that fall between the two members, indicating a mixed source of magmatic and sedimentary. The lead isotope values also indicate that the sulfides from the hydrothermal stage have a mixed Pb source of magmatic and sedimentary.
                  The skarn ores are spatially and genetically related to the Triassic granodiorite, indicating a Triassic age for ore formation. The Triassic magmatic intrusions hold the potential for future gold deposit exploration in the WKOB.
