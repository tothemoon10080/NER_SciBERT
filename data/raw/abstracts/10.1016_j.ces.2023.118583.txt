The treatment and recycling of heavy metal pollutants are vital for the restoration of the ecological environment and the recovery and reuse of resources. Herein, we report an atomic-economic method to synthesize a novel CaCr-layered double hydroxide (LDH) by extracting toxic Cr3+ (more than 1000 mg/L) from industrial wastewater, by which the wastewater can be purified to discharge standards. The obtained CaCr-LDH can be reused for the super-stable mineralization of multiple heavy metal ions with a high capacity, and the removal capacities of Ni, Co, Cu and Zn ions are 306.7 mg/g, 578.0 mg/g, 657.9 mg/g, and 352.1 mg/g, respectively. Furthermore, CaCr-LDH has the advantages of a large treatment range, anti-interference, alkali corrosion resistance, low cost, and less sludge. In the above mineralization process, CaCr-LDH converts to MCaCr-LDH (M = Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) through an isomorphous substitution process. The obtained NiCaCr-LDH products show excellent performance in photocatalytic CO2 reduction with a high CH4 selectivity of 34.8% under visible light. The MCaCr-LDH products can selectively adsorb gold ions with approximately 90% adsorption efficiency and reduce them with approximately 80% reduction efficiency from printed circuit board leaching wastewater, offering promising functionalities for improving environmental pollution, resource waste, and energy crises.
