Polymeric separators and electrolytes have been widely used in Li-ion batteries in recent decades because of their unique features. However, they have some disadvantages that limit their application in this field. Incorporating an inorganic filler into the polymer matrix can almost solve these problems. Inorganic nanomaterials play this role more significantly. The unique properties of clay minerals and compatibility with commercial polymers used as a separator and solid electrolytes makes them a suitable choice for being applied in the structure of Li-ion batteries. In this review, clay minerals, their characteristics, and applications in Li-ion batteries are briefly introduced. Also, the effect of clay minerals on functional properties from different aspects such as ion conductivity, porosity, thermal and mechanical stability, and maximum capacity, which has been investigated in various studies, is discussed.
