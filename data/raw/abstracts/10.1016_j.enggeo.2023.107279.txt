The anomalous enrichment of clay minerals in fault zones is considered a key factor affecting the seismic behavior of faults, fault permeability, and mineralization. This process also weakens the rock strength and triggers deformation, instability, and geological disasters. Nevertheless, the geological factors affecting the growth and anomalous enrichment patterns of clay minerals in fault zones are not systematically understood. In this study, the anomalous enrichment patterns of clay minerals within 220 natural faults are investigated (detailed information can be found in Appendix A). The main geological factors and processes affecting the anomalous enrichment of clay minerals in fault zones are revealed. The main formation modes and occurrence forms of the clay minerals in fault zones are investigated. The anomalous patterns of clay minerals in fault zones are classified into four categories and eight types, i.e., the felsic anomaly category (illite type and kaolinite type), mafic anomaly category (chlorite type), ultramafic anomaly category (smectite type, serpentine + talc type, vermiculite type, and palygorskite + sepiolite type), and argillaceous anomaly category (mixed-layer type). The 220 case studies include different types of faults and fault rocks. Thus, the results are promising for a wide range of engineering geological applications, e.g., analysis of fault activity and permeability changes and studying the genetic mechanisms of geological disasters near faults.
