Natural zeolite can modify the mechanical properties of concrete as a supplementary cementitious material based on pozzolanic activity. However, the pozzolanic reaction is difficult to explain because of the formation of amorphous reaction products and the complexity of concrete systems. In this study, the mineral, amorphpus phase compositions and pozzolanic reaction mechanism of zeolite were further investigated by performing X-ray diffraction (XRD) and magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) analysis. Additionally, the pozzolanic activity of Ca(OH)2 (CH)/zeolite (CHZ, 0–50 wt% proportions of zeolite) specimens was investigated after 1, 3, 7, and 28 d of hydration. The pozzolanic products were identified as C-(A)-S-H gel and monocarboaluminate (AFmc) mineral. Zeolite, having a 5 wt% proportion of CHZ specimens, completely reacted after 3 d of hydration. The optimal zeolite proportion for forming AFmc minerals in CHZ specimens after hydration (HCHZ) was 5 wt%. As the zeolite proportion increased beyond 20 wt%, [Al(OH)4]- tended to react with [SiO(OH)3]- to form aluminosilicate gel instead of AFmc. After carbonation curing (CO2 concentration, 99%; gas pressure, 0.2 MPa; curing time, 2 h), the compressive strength of CHZ specimens (CCHZ) improved by 14–34% compared with that of pure CH specimens. An amorphous phase/calcite ratio of approximately 0.21 might produce an optimum strength resistance property in CCHZ. The heat released from the carbonation was beneficial for the polycondensation reaction of amorphous aluminosilicate to partially form Si[OSi]4 or Al[OSi]4 structures.
