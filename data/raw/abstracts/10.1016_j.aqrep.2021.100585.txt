Oysters are rich in nutrients and can be cultivated in oceans; therefore they have attracted considerable interest as a food source. In this study, we investigated the rapid analysis of multiple minerals in oysters using microwave decomposition combined with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. Because all body parts of oysters other than the shell are edible, we homogenized all the edible parts and used them as samples. Multiple sample masses and acid-digestion formulations (nitric acid only and nitric acid with hydrogen peroxide) were evaluated in a microwave decomposition step using zinc as the target analyte. The levels of calcium, potassium, sodium, and magnesium were also studied. Microwave digestion using nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide yielded slightly higher mineral concentration results than those obtained with nitric acid alone. The mineral composition of oysters varies with the cultivation location and season. With the establishment of an appropriate database, the proposed method for the evaluation of mineral content could be used for rapidly determining the origin of oysters.
