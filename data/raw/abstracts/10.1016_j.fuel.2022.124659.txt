It is essential to understand the law by which coal adsorbs water to prevent coal and rock disasters in the mining process. However, the hydration of coal containing inorganic minerals is seldom studied. In this study, X-ray diffraction (XRD), low-pressure nitrogen adsorption (LPNA), and low-temperature carbon dioxide adsorption (TCA) experiments were performed on coal samples to obtain inorganic mineral compositions and pore structure characteristics. Then, vacuum vapor sorption analyzer (VVS) experiments were carried out on coal samples. GAB and Freundlich models were used to classify the strong adsorption region, weak adsorption region, and critical humidity for monolayer adsorption. The relationship between the amount of adsorbed water and the coal's pore structure and surface chemical properties was discussed. Then, the reason for the difference in specific surface area between N2 and H2O adsorbents was elucidated. Finally, we discuss the significance of coal-water adsorption by pyrite and clay minerals in preventing coal and dynamic rock disasters.
