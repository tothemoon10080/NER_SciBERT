Patients with hemodialysis (HD) have a defective immune response leading to increased susceptibility to infections and increased cell apoptosis which directly correlated with oxidative stress (OS). Kidney dysfunction may also affect the changes in the levels of minerals such as phosphorus, potassium, sodium and calcium, which could be responsible for calcification of coronary arteries. Delaying the vascular calcification is thought to be very important by using some chemical substances. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients show molecular evidence of apoptotic activation. The apoptosis process of execution is regulated by a caspase-3 dependent pathway; using some chemical substances may inhibit apoptosis by reduced expression of caspase-3. Inhibition of caspase-3 activity leads to increased cell proliferation. Hemodialysis contributes to major changes in the antioxidant system and changes in patients' blood mineral levels, cardiovascular risk factors that could be correlated with inflammation, and vascular calcification (VC). The study was focused to evaluate of some blood minerals can be useful for follow-up and treatment hemodialysis patients. These minerals can also have an effect on the HD process and can also be useful for reducing the side effects of therapy by hemodialysis.
