Sulfonamides (SAs) are common antibiotics that are widely present in the environment and can easily migrate in the environment, so they pose an environmental risk. Minerals and organic matter influence the antibiotic migration and transformation in sewage treatment plants, activated sludge, surface water, and soil environment. In the present paper, the influence of the process and mechanism of minerals and organic matter on the adsorption, degradation, and plant uptake of SAs in soil were summarized. In the impact process of mineral and organic matter on the SAs migration and transformation, the pH value is undoubtedly the most important factor because it determines the ionic state of SAs. In terms of influence mechanisms, the minerals absorb SAs well via cation exchange, complexation, H-bonding, and cation bridging. Mineral photodegradation is also one of the primary removal methods for SAs. Soil organic matter (SOM) can significantly increase the SAs adsorption. The adsorption forces of SAs and SOM or dissolved organic matter (DOM) were very similar, but SOM decreased SAs mobility in the environment, while DOM increased SAs availability. DOM generated active substances and aided in the photodegradation of SAs. This review describes the effects of minerals and organic matter on the fate of SAs in soil, which is useful in controlling the migration and transformation of SAs in the soil environment.
