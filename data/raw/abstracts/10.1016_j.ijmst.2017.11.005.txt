Long-term planning is one of the most important stages that determines the distribution of cash flows over the mine life and the feasibility of the project. However, it is not feasible in block caving to generate a production schedule that will provide optimal operating strategies without considering geotechnical constraints. This paper develops a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to optimize the extraction sequence of drawpoints over multiple time horizons of block-cave mines with respect to the draw control systems. A multi-similarity index clustering technique to solve the MILP model in a reasonable time is also presented. Application and comparison of production scheduling based on the draw control system and clustering technique are illustrated using 325 drawpoints over 15 periods. The results show a significant reduction in the size of the MILP model, and in the time required to solve it.
