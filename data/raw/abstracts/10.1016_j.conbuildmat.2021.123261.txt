When the bio-mineralization consumed Ca(OH)2 in cement-based materials, the CaCO3 generated in the pores would reduce the porosity of the specimen. Based on the mineralization of carbon-fixing microorganisms, this paper studied the effect of bio-mineralization on the surface efflorescence area on the mortar, and further studied the composition of efflorescence and the microstructure of the surface layer. Image processing (by OTSU), XRD (X-ray diffraction), TG (thermogravimetric), and MIP (Mercury intrusion porosimetry) were used to characterize the efflorescence area, efflorescence composition and porosity of the specimen. The results showed that bio-mineralization reduced the efflorescence area on the surface of the specimen, up to 25.6%; the efflorescence composition in the control group were mainly Na2SO4 and CaCO3, while in the mineralization group, the efflorescence substances were mainly Na2SO4; Bio-mineralization reduced the porosity and changed the pore size distribution of the surface layer of the specimen, and the large pores were transformed into small ones. This treatment for anti-efflorescence was convenient, environment friendly, potential in various practical applications, such as the anti-efflorescence of decorative mortar.
