Petroleum contains low biodegradability compounds, requiring powerful oxidants to become mineralized or more biodegradable. This study therefore aimed to compare the efficiency of Fentonâ€™s reagent with the Ozone process in the mineralization or change in biodegradability potential of water contaminated by crude petroleum. Analyses of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) and total organic carbon (TOC) values were performed in this study. In relation to the Fenton treatment, the TOC removal efficiency ranged from 33 % (1% H2O2 -1 mM Fe2+) to 75 % (20 % H2O2 - 1 mM Fe2+) and resulted in a BOD5/COD ratio of 0.23 ([H2O2] = 1%) or 0.45 ([H2O2] = 10 %). Concerning the Ozone process, higher Ozone consumption occurred at high pH, where TOC removal reached 24 % after 60 min of treatment but resulted in a BOD5/COD ratio of only 0.23, which is a small improvement in the biodegradability. Based on the TOC removal or BOD5/COD ratio values, this study concludes that the Fenton treatment is more efficient than Ozone to mineralize or increase biodegradability potential of water contaminated with crude petroleum.
