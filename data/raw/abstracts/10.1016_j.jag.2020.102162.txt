In spite of the dominance of traditional mineral exploration methods that demand physical characterization of rocks and intense field work, remote sensing technologies have also evolved in the recent past to facilitate mineral exploration. In the present study, we have processed visible near infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands of Advanced space-borne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) data to detect surface mineralization signatures in Mundiyawas - Khera area in Alwar basin, north-eastern Rajasthan, India using spectral angle mapper (SAM). The potential of SAM method to detect target under variable illumination condition was used to delineate galena, chalcopyrite, malachite etc. as surface signatures of mineralization. It was ensured that the identified surface anomalies were spectrally pure using pixel purity index. Spectral anomalies were validated in the field and also using X-Ray diffraction data. Spectral anomaly maps thus derived were integrated using weight of evidence method with the lineament density, geochemical anomaly, bouger anomaly maps to identify few additional potential areas of mineralization. This study thus establishes the importance of remote sensing in mineral exploration to zero in on potentially ore rich but unexplored zones.
