The calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium, phosphorus, sulphur, copper, iron, manganese and zinc content of Nigerian traditionally fermented maize food (akamu) against ground whole maize slurries fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum strains were evaluated using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES). The mineral content of the traditional akamu samples varied significantly (p < 0.05), except for calcium, sodium and zinc levels in the range of 38–70, 210–236, 6–10 mg kg−1 respectively. Calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium, sulphur and zinc (>73, 2044, 727, 284, 765 and 16 mg kg−1 respectively) levels in the fermented ground whole maize slurries were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than levels in the akamu samples. The mean maximum values expressed as a percentage of recommended intake levels for infants ≤1 year were ≤50% except for potassium, magnesium and phosphorus in the fermented whole ground maize, iron in the traditional akamu, and copper and manganese in both. The findings of this study will be relevant in food composition values and an addition to the knowledge of dietary limitations of these minerals in akamu as well as the preference for fermentation of ground whole grain slurries against the traditional process of wet sieving and water decanting.
