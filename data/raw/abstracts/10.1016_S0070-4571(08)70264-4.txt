This chapter summarizes the varied role of evaporites in the formation of commercial concentrations of valuable materials with emphasis on geologic environments. There is a biased coverage of evaporitic sequences in North America with which the author is more familiar. Although evaporitic geologic environments are important in the formation of petroleum and oil shales, these types of energy resources are not considered in this chapter. The role of evaporites and evaporitic processes in the formation of commercial concentrations of mineral resources is diverse indeed. Many evaporite deposits of both marine and lacustrine types are valuable industrial rocks that supply widely used materials for the construction, chemical, and agricultural industries. Evaporites also serve as the feedstock for natural processes that either have formed valuable materials or have provided a favorable environment for the chemical trapping of externally supplied elements. Evaporitic brine-associated alteration may be important in the formation of commercial concentrations of valuable industrial minerals such as zeolites. In addition to being sources of important industrial rocks and minerals, evaporate deposits also serve as the feedstock for geologic processes that either formed valuable materials or provided a favorable environment for the chemical trapping of externally supplied elements.
