The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a significant negative influence on the environment and natural resources, especially in developing countries that already face environmental issues. This research examines the effects of the pandemic on environmental degradation and natural resource depletion in developing countries. In this study, the fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and fuzzy Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) methods are used to examine the challenges and solutions for environmental and natural resource management with a special attention on mineral resources policy. In this regard, the various critical challenges and solutions are proposed for the sustainable development of mineral resources. According to the results of the fuzzy AHP approach, the depletion of natural resources, energy use and emissions, and deforestation and biodiversity loss are of paramount relevance challenges. While, the fuzzy WASPAS results show that sustainable development planning, research innovation, and conservation and protection of natural resources are key solutions in addressing environmental and natural resource depletion after the Covid-19 crisis in developing countries. The findings have enriched our understanding regarding how the Covid-19 outbreak has affected the environment and natural resources in developing countries. The study highlights the significance of considering mineral resources in the overall assessment and the need for sustainable resource management practices throughout the post-pandemic recovery stage.
